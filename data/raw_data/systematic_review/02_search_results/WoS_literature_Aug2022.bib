Abstract = {Maternally derived hormones induce variation in offspring phenotype,
   with consequences that can carry over into post-natal life and even into
   adulthood. In birds, maternal egg corticosterone (CORT) is known to
   exert contrasting effects on offspring morphology, physiology and
   behaviour after hatching. However, information on the effects of CORT
   exposure on pre-hatching embryonic development is limited. We
   experimentally increased yolk CORT levels in yellow-legged gull (Larus
   michahellis) eggs, and assessed the effects on embryo pre-hatching
   development and oxidative status of brain and liver. CORT-supplemented
   embryos reached a larger skeletal size and liver mass compared with
   controls. Embryos from CORT-injected last-laid eggs showed decreased
   activity of the hepatic antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and
   catalase, while intermediate-laid eggs showed increased levels of lipid
   peroxidation. However, elevated yolk CORT did not affect oxidative
   stress endpoints in the brain. Our results indicate that elevated yolk
   CORT levels affect prenatal embryo development by promoting skeletal
   growth, and induce laying sequence- and organ-specific oxidative
   imbalance, with potential adverse consequences during postnatal life,
   especially for late-hatched offspring.},

Title = {Experimental manipulation of maternal corticosterone: Hormone transfer
   to the yolk in the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata},
Journal = {GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {313},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Maternally-derived hormones affect offspring physiological and
   behavioural phenotype, plausibly as an adaptive response to maternal
   environmental conditions. Corticosterone (CORT), the principal avian
   glucocorticoid produced in response to stress, is recognised as a
   potential mediator of such maternal reproductive effects.
   Maternally-derived yolk CORT is implicated in mediating offspring growth
   and hatchling begging behaviour. However, determining the potential for
   maternal effects in opportunistic breeders subject to variable
   environments relies on understanding whether natural variation in
   maternal circulating hormones may directly impact the embryo during
   development. Therefore, we tested whether elevated maternal CORT
   concentrations increase yolk CORT concentrations in zebra finch
   (Taeniopygia guttata) eggs. We remotely dosed breeding females with
   biologically-relevant doses of CORT, or the oil vehicle, 0-3 h prior to
   the predicted time of ovulation, and allowed pairs to produce two
   clutches, one under each treatment, in a crosswise, balanced design.
   CORT dosing elevated maternal plasma CORT and increased mean yolk CORT
   by a factor of 1.75 compared to the egg yolks of control mothers.
   Importantly, CORT concentrations did not differ between inner and outer
   layers of yolk. We found no egg lay order effect and maternal CORT
   dosing did not influence reproductive outputs (clutch initiation date,
   clutch size or egg mass). Our results confirm the direct impact of
   biologically-relevant increases in maternal CORT on yolk CORT, providing
   evidence that maternal CORT concentrations during yolk deposition to the
   follicle alters embryonic exogenous CORT exposure. Further research is
   required to determine the impact of maternal CORT on embryonic
   developmental programming.},

Title = {Interaction of egg cortisol and offspring experience influences
   stress-related behaviour and physiology in lake sturgeon},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {161},
Pages = {49-59},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Quantifying transgenerational effects of stress is important to predict
   outcomes of anthropogenic disturbances for wildlife species. Maternal
   stress can programme physiological and behavioural phenotypes in
   offspring, which may be maladaptive if maternal and offspring
   environments are mismatched. We investigated effects of a match and
   mismatch between egg cortisol and offspring stress levels in lake
   sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, using artificially elevated egg cortisol
   levels (simulating maternal stress) and a chronic unpredictable stress
   regime for offspring after hatch. Offspring cortisol levels were
   quantified at baseline and after an acute stressor. Multiple measures of
   offspring swimming activity were assessed in behaviour trials.
   Individuals that experienced elevated egg cortisol and high offspring
   stress exhibited a diminished cortisol response to an acute stressor,
   but responses varied among offspring from different families. Results
   suggest that the interaction between maternal and offspring experience
   may cue an offspring phenotype that is adaptive in high-stress
   conditions. Principal components analysis characterizing interindividual
   variation in offspring behavioural variables showed that treatment
   significantly affected multivariate offspring response along the PC1
   axis (associated with inactivity), and both treatment and family
   significantly affected response along the PC2 axis (associated with
   shorter distance moved). The largest differences for PC1 occurred
   between the `mismatch' treatments (high egg cortisol and low offspring
   stress exhibiting lower activity; low egg cortisol and high offspring
   stress exhibiting higher activity), indicating that the combination of
   egg cortisol and offspring stress is more important in determining
   offspring behaviour than is egg cortisol or offspring stress alone.
   Findings suggest that family effects, such as genetic components or
   maternal experience, may mediate how the interaction of maternal and
   offspring stress influences offspring physiological and behavioural
   outcomes, and indicate the need for further research into environmental
   factors experienced by females that influence how offspring respond to
   egg cortisol and early life stress. (C) 2020 The Association for the

Title = {Egg corticosterone can stimulate telomerase activity and promote longer
   telomeres during embryo development},
Journal = {MOLECULAR ECOLOGY},
Abstract = {It is often assumed that the transfer of maternal glucocorticoids (GCs;
   e.g., corticosterone or cortisol) to offspring is an inevitable cost
   associated with adverse or stressful conditions experienced by mothers.
   However, recent evidence indicates that maternal GCs may adaptively
   programme particular physiological and molecular pathways during
   development to enhance offspring fitness. In this context, an important
   mechanism through which maternal GCs may lastingly affect offspring
   phenotypic quality and survival is via effects on embryo telomerase
   activity and so on offspring postnatal telomere length. Here, using a
   field experimental design for which we manipulated the corticosterone
   content in yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) eggs, we show that
   embryos from corticosterone-injected eggs not only had a higher
   telomerase activity but also longer telomeres just after hatching. A
   complementary analysis further revealed that gull hatchlings with longer
   telomeres had a higher survival probability during the period when most
   of the chick mortality occurs. Given the important role that telomere
   length and its restoring mechanisms have on ageing trajectories and
   disease risk, our findings provide a new mechanistic link by which
   mothers may presumably shape offspring life-history trajectories and
   phenotype.},

Abstract = {Maternal hormones in avian egg yolks may signal and prepare offspring
   for the prevailing conditions. However, this adjustment requires some
   degree of flexibility in regulating yolk hormone deposition. The Greater
   Rhea (Rhea americana) has a particular mating system that combines mixed
   polygyny and polyandry, communal nesting, and exclusive paternal care of
   chicks. In this species, we previously found that yolk hormone
   deposition varies among eggs of different captive populations and could
   influence chicks' physiology and behavior. However, it is still unknown
   whether females can modify yolk hormone deposition in a changing social
   environment. Using a captive population of Greater Rheas, in this study,
   we quantified yolk hormone levels before and after a reduction in the
   number of females present in the population. We found that females
   deposited on average higher yolk corticosterone and lower yolk
   progesterone after the change in their social environment. Since
   corticosterone deposited into the yolk comes exclusively from the
   female's plasma, our results suggest that females had, on average,
   higher plasma corticosterone levels. The change in the number of females
   may increase the events of male-male competitions, courtships, and
   matings, leading to an increase of corticosterone in the females' plasma
   and then into their eggs. Since we previously found that higher yolk
   corticosterone and lower yolk progesterone were associated with the
   production of chicks that have an attenuated stress response, the
   present study results suggest that yolk hormone deposition is mediated
   by flexible mechanisms that could adjust development to the prevailing
   conditions.},

Title = {Sex-specific effects of hatching order on nestling baseline
   corticosterone in a wild songbird},
Journal = {GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {319},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Variation in nestling growth and survival is often influenced by
   hatching order, with first-hatched offspring having an advantage over
   later-hatched younger siblings. In house wrens (Troglodytes aedon), this
   effect of hatching order is especially evident in asynchronously hatched
   broods and can lead to sex-specific differences in the size and
   condition of nestlings. Females appear to allocate the sex of their
   offspring across the laying order to capitalize on these differences. We
   hypothesized that levels of circulating corticosterone, the primary
   metabolic hormone in birds, mediates these sex-specific effects in
   nestlings. We predicted that: i) baseline levels of corticosterone in
   nestlings should vary along the hatching order, ii) effects of hatching
   order on baseline corticosterone should be sex specific, and iii) any
   sex-specificity of hatching order on baseline corticosterone could be
   contingent on the degree of hatching synchrony. We tested these
   predictions in a study in which we measured baseline corticosterone in
   first- and last-hatched nestlings in synchronously and asynchronously
   hatching broods. To assess whether any differences in nestling baseline
   corticosterone levels could be attributed to pre-natal maternal effects,
   the post-natal environment, or both, we conducted two additional studies
   in which we measured i) yolk corticosterone in first- and last-laid eggs
   and ii) baseline corticosterone in nestlings that were cross-fostered to
   create simulated `asynchronously' hatched broods. There was a
   significant interaction between sex and relative hatching order in their
   effects on nestling baseline corticosterone, but no effect of hatching
   synchrony. Corticosterone levels remained relatively constant across the
   hatching order in males but decreased in females. There was a
   significant effect of laying order on yolk corticosterone, with
   first-laid eggs containing significantly higher levels of yolk
   corticosterone than last-laid eggs. Cross-fostering of nestlings at
   different points of development had no significant effect on nestling
   corticosterone levels. These results indicate that sexdependent
   differences in corticosterone levels across the hatching order may
   arise, at least in part, from embryonic exposure to maternally derived
   corticosterone, whereas the post-natal rearing environment plays, at
   best, a minimal role in determining nestling baseline corticosterone
   levels.},

   mother to the next generation. The systematic changes of yolk hormone
   concentrations within asynchronously hatching clutches have been
   interpreted as a means to adaptively shape the offspring's phenotype.
   However, in synchronously hatching clutches the role of yolk hormones is
   less understood. We investigated whether seasonal changes between eggs
   in the yolk hormones testosterone (Testo), progesterone (Prog) and
   corticosterone (Cort) also occur in the grey partridge, a synchronously
   hatching precocial species without direct food competition between
   siblings. Specifically we asked whether yolk hormone concentrations
   systematically vary with season and whether they affect the offspring's
   hatching mass, mass gain, circulating baseline and stress-induced Cort.
   Additionally, we investigated the effect of genetic background and food
   availability on yolk hormone concentrations by subjecting grey partridge
   hens of two strains (wild and domesticated) to two different feeding
   regimes (predictable vs. unpredictable feeding) during egg laying. We
   hypothesized that egg hormone concentrations change over the season, but
   breeding in captivity over many generations and ad libitum food access
   could have resulted in domestication effects which abolished potential
   seasonal effects. Results showed that progressing season had a strong
   positive effect on yolk Prog and yolk Testo, but not on yolk Cort.
   Feeding regimes and strain had no effect on yolk hormones. Offspring
   mass and mass gain increased and baseline Cort decreased with
   progressing season. In addition, yolk Testo correlated positively with
   offspring mass gain and negatively with baseline Cort, while yolk Prog
   had a positive correlation with baseline Cort. Strain and feeding
   regimes of the mother had no effect on offspring traits. In conclusion,
   grey partridge chicks hatching late in the season might benefit from the
   increased concentrations of the growth-stimulating yolk Testo and by
   this catch-up in development. Hence, yolk hormone concentration could
   adaptively shape the offspring phenotype in a precocial species.},

Abstract = {Maternal corticosterone in avian egg yolks may signal and prepare
   offspring for the prevailing conditions. However, this adjustment
   requires flexible mechanisms of regulation that lead to the absence of a
   correlation between hormone levels in the mother and the yolk. In this
   study, we examined whether yolk immunoreactive corticosterone and
   maternal glucocorticoid levels are related in the Greater Rhea (Rhea
   americana), a ratite species with a communal nesting system. During the
   intermediate laying period of the season, we carried out daily
   nest-observations to collect those eggs in which the laying female was
   identified. We also collected fresh fecal samples from the identified
   laying females to quantify their fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM)
   levels during the yolk formation period (7 days before egg-laying). Yolk
   immunoreactive corticosterone and FGM levels were measured using a
   corticosterone(125)radioimmunoassay kit, previously validated for the
   species. No significant relationships were found between female FGM and
   yolk immunoreactive corticosterone. Although futures studies are needed
   to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, our results suggest that Greater
   Rhea female may be able to control the distribution of corticosterone
   into their yolks, supporting the idea that this hormone may be mediating
   an adaptive maternal effect.},

Title = {Mimicking Transgenerational Signals of Future Stress: Thermal Tolerance
   of Juvenile Chinook Salmon Is More Sensitive to Elevated Rearing
   Temperature Than Exogenously Increased Egg Cortisol},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Elevated temperatures resulting from climate change are expected to
   disproportionately affect ectotherms given their biological function has
   a direct link to environmental temperature. Thus, as climate change
   leads to rapid increases in water temperatures in rivers, aquatic
   ectotherms, such as fish may be highly impacted. Organisms can respond
   to these stressors through flexible and rapid phenotypic change induced
   via developmental and/or transgenerational plasticity. In oviparous
   species, gravid females may translate environmental stress across
   generations via increased exposure of eggs to maternally derived
   glucocorticoids (i.e., maternal stress), which has been shown to result
   in diverse phenotypic effects in offspring. Recent studies suggest these
   phenotypic changes from maternal glucocorticoids may elicit predictive
   adaptive responses, where offspring exposed to maternal stress may be
   better prepared for the stressful environment they will encounter (i.e.,
   environmental match hypothesis). We applied the environmental match
   hypothesis to examine whether a prenatal exogenous increase in egg
   cortisol may prepare Chinook salmon offspring (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha)
   to cope with thermal challenges after being reared in chronically
   elevated temperatures. Specifically, we exposed eggs to aqueous bath of
   cortisol-dosed (1,000 ng/mL) or control (0 ng/ml) solutions, and then
   raised both treatments at current (+0 degrees C-contemporary ambient
   river temperature) or elevated (+3 degrees C-projected future river
   temperature) thermal regimes. We quantified thermal performance in fish
   7-9 month post fertilization using two methods: via critical thermal
   maximum (CTMax), and energetic responses (in plasma cortisol, glucose,
   and lactate) to environmentally relevant, but challenging thermal spikes
   over 3 days. Overall, we found that exposure to elevated rearing
   temperatures had a large impact on thermal tolerance, where
   elevated-temperature reared offspring had significantly higher CTMax. In
   comparison, egg cortisol treatment had little to no clear effects on
   CTMax and blood energetic response. Our study demonstrates the
   importance of elevated water temperatures as an inducer of offspring
   phenotypes (via early developmental cues), and highlights the
   significance of examining offspring performance in environments with
   ecologically relevant stressors.},

Title = {Prenatal manipulation of yolk androgen levels affects egg size but not

Year = {2021},
Volume = {75},

Abstract = {Maternal allocation of androgens to the egg yolk allows mothers to
   adaptively manipulate offspring phenotype. Increases of egg androgen
   levels have often been shown to induce sex-specific effects. Some
   previous studies suggest that females specifically may suffer a fitness
   reduction after early exposure to high androgen levels. In this study,
   we explored whether female birds that developed exposed to high yolk
   androgen concentrations would reduce their maternal investment later in
   life. We explored two different aspects of female reproduction in
   spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor): egg coloration (a post mating
   sexual signal in this species) and egg size. We manipulated androgen
   yolk levels in a large sample of clutches of this species. We monitored
   the reproduction of the females that hatched from these eggs, measuring
   the size and colour of the eggs they laid throughout their life (from 1
   to 7 years of age). We found no overall difference in egg colour in
   relation to treatment, clutch number or age. However, females exposed to
   high egg androgen levels showed a steeper decrease in egg size along the
   laying order than controls. This pattern likely results in a more
   unbalanced distribution of resources within the clutch, possibly
   favouring brood size reductions in experimental females. In addition,
   control and experimental females differed in how egg volume changed with
   age. These results show that some egg characteristics may be affected by
   the female's exposure to yolk androgens during her own embryonic
   development. Our research calls for further long-term research on the
   influence of prenatal androgens on the fitness mechanisms regulating
   reproductive investment and its potential signalling role in a
   perspective of sexual selection.Significance statementIn birds, mothers
   prepare the offspring to the environment they will encounter at hatching
   by depositing a mixture of compounds into the eggs. Androgens
   specifically exert a variety of effects during embryo development and
   chick growth, but some of these may be negative in adult life. In
   particular, early androgen may be detrimental for females in the long
   term, decreasing maternal investment and fitness. Using the spotless
   starling as study species, we tested whether an experimental increase in
   yolk androgens negatively affects breeding investment, measured by egg
   colour (a sexual signal) and egg size. We found no effects of the
   treatment on egg colour. However, females exposed to high androgen
   levels during their development reduced egg size along the laying order
   more strongly than controls. This may affect nestling survival, and
   indicates that prenatal yolk androgens may influence some egg
   characteristics with known relevance for offspring viability.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {225},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Maternal hormones can shape offspring development and increase survival
   when predation risk is elevated. In songbirds, yolk androgens influence
   offspring growth and begging behaviors, which can help mitigate
   offspring predation risk in the nest. Other steroids may also be
   important for responding to nest predation risk, but non-androgen
   steroids have been poorly studied. We used a nest predator playback
   experiment and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry
   (LC-MS-MS) to assess whether nest predation risk influences deposition
   of 10 yolk steroids. We found no clear evidence that yolk androgen
   deposition changed when perception of nest predation risk was
   experimentally increased. However, elevated nest predation risk led to
   decreased yolk progesterone deposition. Overall, our results suggest
   yolk progesterone may be more important than yolk androgens in responses
   to offspring predation risk and highlight new avenues for research.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Controversial glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) are the most frequently
   used herbicides globally. GBH residues are detected in soil, water,
   crops, and food products, potentially exposing non-target organisms to
   health risks; these organisms include wildlife, livestock, and humans.
   However, the potential for GBH-related parental effects are poorly
   understood. In the case of birds, GBHs may be transferred directly from
   mothers to eggs, or they may indirectly influence offspring performance
   by altered maternal resource allocation to eggs. We experimentally
   exposed a parental generation of Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica) to
   GBHs (200mg/kg feed) or respective controls. Glyphosate residues were
   found in eggs (ca 0.76kg/mg). Embryonic development tended to be poorer
   in the eggs of GBH-exposed parents (76\% of eggs showed normal
   development) compared to control parents (89\% normal eggs). Embryonic
   brain tissue from GBH-exposed parents tended to express more lipid
   damage (20\% higher), yet other biomarkers showed no apparent
   differences. We detected no differences in egg quality (egg, yolk, or
   shell mass, egg hormone concentration) across the treatment groups.
   Given this is the first long-term study testing parental effects of GBHs
   with birds, more studies are needed characterizing GBH-associated
   changes in maternal allocation and for example epigenetic programming.},

Title = {Who listens to mother? A whole-family perspective on the evolution of
   maternal hormone allocation},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {96},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1951-1968},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Maternal effects, or the influence of maternal environment and phenotype
   on offspring phenotype, may allow mothers to fine-tune their offspring's
   developmental trajectory and resulting phenotype sometimes long after
   the offspring has reached independence. However, maternal effects on
   offspring phenotype do not evolve in isolation, but rather within the
   context of a family unit, where the separate and often conflicting
   evolutionary interests of mothers, fathers and offspring are all at
   play. While intrafamilial conflicts are routinely invoked to explain
   other components of reproductive strategy, remarkably little is known
   about how intrafamilial conflicts influence maternal effects. We argue
   that much of the considerable variation in the relationship between
   maternally derived hormones, nutrients and other compounds and the
   resulting offspring phenotype might be explained by the presence of
   conflicting selection pressures on different family members. In this
   review, we examine the existing literature on maternal hormone
   allocation as a case study for maternal effects more broadly, and
   explore new hypotheses that arise when we consider current findings
   within a framework that explicitly incorporates the different
   evolutionary interests of the mother, her offspring and other family
   members. Specifically, we hypothesise that the relationship between
   maternal hormone allocation and offspring phenotype depends on a
   mother's ability to manipulate the signals she sends to offspring, the
   ability of family members to be plastic in their response to those
   signals and the capacity for the phenotypes and strategies of various
   family members to interact and influence one another on both behavioural
   and evolutionary timescales. We also provide suggestions for
   experimental, comparative and theoretical work that may be instrumental
   in testing these hypotheses. In particular, we highlight that
   manipulating the level of information available to different family
   members may reveal important insights into when and to what extent
   maternal hormones influence offspring development. We conclude that the
   evolution of maternal hormone allocation is likely to be shaped by the
   conflicting fitness optima of mothers, fathers and offspring, and that
   the outcome of this conflict depends on the relative balance of power
   between family members. Extending our hypotheses to incorporate
   interactions between family members, as well as more complex social
   groups and a wider range of taxa, may provide exciting new developments
   in the fields of endocrinology and maternal effects.},

Abstract = {Prenatal maternal effects are increasingly recognized as important
   mediators in the development of individual differences during early
   sensitive or even critical periods. Hormone-mediated maternal effects in
   egg-laying species are a frequently used model to study such effects,
   mostly to test whether these increase maternal fitness. However,
   experimental evidence is inconsistent. This has led researchers to
   divert to other topics. In this review, we argue that from a Darwinian
   perspective one should however expect strong interactions between
   effects of maternal hormones with contextual cues, including
   environmental factors, embryonic modulation of maternal signals,
   offspring age and sex, and fathers' influence. Taking these into account
   may explain the inconsistencies and new experiments should reveal how
   the benefits and costs of maternal hormones and prenatal maternal
   effects in general play out in different contexts.},

Title = {Characterizing the timing of yolk testosterone metabolism and the
   effects of etiocholanolone on development in avian eggs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {223},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Maternal transfer of steroids to eggs can elicit permanent effects on
   offspring phenotype. Although testosterone was thought to be a key
   mediator of maternal effects in birds, we now know that vertebrate
   embryos actively regulate their exposure to maternal testosterone
   through steroid metabolism, suggesting testosterone metabolites, not
   testosterone, may elicit the observed phenotypic effects. To address the
   role steroid metabolism plays in mediating yolk testosterone effects, we
   used European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) eggs to characterize the
   timing of testosterone metabolism and determine whether etiocholanolone,
   a prominent metabolite of testosterone in avian embryos, is capable of
   affecting early embryonic development. Tritiated testosterone was
   injected into freshly laid eggs to characterize steroid movement and
   metabolism during early development. Varying levels of etiocholanolone
   were also injected into eggs, with incubation for either 3 or 5 days, to
   test whether etiocholanolone influences the early growth of embryonic
   tissues. The conversion of testosterone to etiocholanolonewas initiated
   within 12 h of injection, but the increase in etiocholanolone was
   transient, indicating that etiocholanolone is also subject to
   metabolism, and that exposure to maternal etiocholanolone is limited to
   a short period during early development. Exogenous etiocholanolone
   manipulation had no significant effect on the growth rate of the embryos
   or extraembryonic membranes early in development. Thus, the conversion
   of testosterone to etiocholanolone may be an inactivation pathway that
   buffers the embryo from maternal steroids, with any effects of yolk
   testosterone resulting from testosterone that escapes metabolism;
   alternatively, etiocholanolone may influence processes other than growth
   or take additional time to manifest.},

Title = {Maternal effects and urbanization: Variation of yolk androgens and
   immunoglobulin in city and forest blackbirds},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {2213-2224},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Wildlife inhabiting urban environments exhibit drastic changes in
   morphology, physiology, and behavior. It has often been argued that
   these phenotypic responses could be the result of micro-evolutionary
   changes following the urbanization process. However, other mechanisms
   such as phenotypic plasticity, maternal effects, and developmental
   plasticity could be involved as well. To address maternal effects as
   potential mechanisms, we compared maternal hormone and antibody
   concentrations in eggs between city and forest populations of European
   blackbirds (Turdus merula), a widely distributed species for which
   previous research demonstrated differences in behavioral and
   physiological traits. We measured egg and yolk mass, yolk concentrations
   of androgens (androstenedione {[}A(4)], testosterone {[}T], 5
   alpha-dihydrotestosterone {[}5 alpha-DHT], and immunoglobulins {[}IgY])
   and related them to population, clutch size, laying order, embryo sex,
   and progress of breeding season. We show (a) earlier onset of laying in
   the city than forest population, but similar egg and clutch size; (b)
   higher overall yolk androgen concentrations in the forest than the city
   population (sex-dependent for T); (c) greater among-female variation of
   yolk T and 5 alpha-DHT concentrations in the forest than city
   population, but similar within-clutch variation; (d) similar IgY
   concentrations with a seasonal decline in both populations; and (e)
   population-specific positive (city) or negative (forest) association of
   yolk A(4) and T with IgY concentrations. Our results are consistent with
   the hypotheses that hormone-mediated maternal effects contribute to
   differences in behavioral and physiological traits between city and
   forest individuals and that yolk androgen and immunoglobulin levels can
   exhibit population-specific relationships rather than trade-off against
   each other.},

Title = {Inter-Individual Variation in Anti-Parasitic Egg Rejection Behavior: A
   Test of the Maternal Investment Hypothesis},
Journal = {INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Hosts of avian brood parasites may reduce or forego the costs of caring
   for foreign young by rejecting parasitic eggs from the nest. Yet, many
   host species accept parasitic eggs and, even among rejecter species,
   some individuals go on to incubate and hatch them. The factors
   explaining the variation in egg rejection between species have received
   much theoretical and empirical attention, but the causes of
   intraspecific variation in different individuals' propensity for
   accepting parasitic eggs are less well understood. Here we tested the
   maternal investment hypothesis, which predicts that hosts with costlier
   clutches will be more likely to reject parasitic eggs from their nest.
   We studied variation in the egg rejection responses of American robins
   (Turdus migratorius), a robust egg-rejecter host of the brood parasitic
   brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater), to 3D-printed cowbird-sized eggs
   which were painted dark blue, a color known to induce variable and
   repeatable egg rejection responses in individual robins. Costlier clutch
   investment was estimated by earlier laying date, larger clutch size,
   heavier unincubated yolk mass, and variable yolk steroid hormone
   concentrations. There was no statistical support for most of our
   predictions. However, we detected more concentrated and greater overall
   amount of deoxycorticosterone deposited in egg yolks of rejecters
   relative to acceptors, although this accounted for no more than 14\% of
   variance in the data. Future work should test experimentally the
   potential physiological linkage between maternal egg yolk steroid
   investment and egg rejection propensity in this and other host species
   of avian brood parasites.},

Title = {In ovo metabolism of estradiol to estrone sulfate in chicken eggs:
   Implications for how yolk estradiol influences embryonic development},
Journal = {GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {287},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {The steroid 17 beta-estradiol (herein ``estradiol{''}) is a potent
   regulator of sexual differentiation that exerts wide-ranging effects on
   the developing brain and other tissues. The developing gonads are an
   important source of estradiol but most, if not all, vertebrate embryos
   are also exposed to maternally derived estradiol during development. In
   birds, this maternally derived estradiol is present in the egg at the
   time of oviposition but very little is known about how this source of
   estradiol influences development. A critical aspect of understanding
   yolk estradiol effects is deciphering how steroid metabolism may
   regulate embryonic exposure to yolk estradiol. In this study, we examine
   the metabolic fate of estradiol during the first five days of incubation
   in chicken (Gallus gallus) eggs. Using tritiated estradiol to trace the
   movement and metabolism of estradiol, we demonstrate that estradiol is
   metabolized to estrone, which is subsequently conjugated to estrone
   sulfate as the primary metabolite. Estrone sulfate then accumulates in
   the albumen by day five of incubation. Overall, these findings have
   important implications for how yolk estradiol may influence development
   and alter offspring phenotype. Mechanisms through which estradiol, as
   well as estrone sulfate, might elicit effects are discussed.},

Abstract = {Avian eggs contain a large number of molecules deposited by the mother
   that provide the embryo with energy but also potentially influence its
   development via the effects of maternally derived hormones and
   antibodies: the avian egg is thus `multivariate'. Multivariate effects
   on offspring phenotype were evaluated in a study on captive zebra
   finches, by simultaneously manipulating maternally derived antibodies
   (MAb) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment of mothers and injection of
   testosterone into the egg yolk. LPS treatment had a positive effect on
   body mass growth at 30 days after hatching and immune response at sexual
   maturity, while egg testosterone treatment positively influenced immune
   response at fledging and courtship behaviour in sexually mature male
   offspring. Maternal effects are known to modulate offspring telomere
   length (TL). However, the multivariate effects of egg-derived maternal
   components on offspring telomere dynamics from hatching to sexual
   maturity are undefined. Here, we tested: (1) the effects of LPS and
   testosterone treatments on TL from hatching to sexual maturity (day 82);
   (2) how LPS treatment modulated TL over reproduction in adult females;
   and (3) the relationship between maternal and offspring TL. We predicted
   that TL would be shorter in LPS fledglings (as a cost of faster growth)
   and that TL would be longer in sexually mature adults after yolk
   testosterone treatment (as a proxy of individual quality). In adult
   females, there was an overall negative relationship between laying and
   rearing investments and TL, this relationship was weaker in LPS-treated
   females. In chicks, there was an overall negative effect of LPS
   treatment on TL measured at fledging and sexual maturity (day 25-82). In
   addition, at fledging, there was a SexxLPSxTestosterone interaction,
   suggesting the existence of antagonistic effects of our treatments. Our
   data partially support the hypothesis that telomeres are proxies of
   individual quality and that individual differences in TL are established
   very early in life.},

Abstract = {Maternal effects have been reported to alter offspring phenotype in
   laying hens. In this study, we investigated the effects of maternal
   environment and maternal age on egg traits and offspring development and
   behaviour. For this, we ran two experiments. First (E1), commercial
   hybrid hens were reared either in aviary or barren brooding cages, then
   housed in aviary, conventional cages or furnished (enriched) cages, thus
   forming different maternal housing treatments. Hens from each treatment
   were inseminated at three ages, and measures of egg composition, yolk
   testosterone concentration and offspring's development, anxiety and
   fearfulness were assessed. In experiment 2 (E2), maternal age effects on
   offspring's growth and behaviour were further investigated using fertile
   eggs from commercial breeder flocks at three different ages. Results
   from E1 showed that Old hens laid heavier eggs with less yolk
   testosterone and produced offspring with fewer indicators of anxiety and
   fearfulness. Maternal rearing and housing affected egg traits, offspring
   weight and behaviour, but not in a consistent way. Effects of maternal
   age were not replicated in E2, possibly due to differences in management
   or higher tolerance to maternal effects in commercial breeders. Overall,
   our research confirms that maternal age and maternal environment affects
   egg composition, with maternal age specifically affecting yolk
   testosterone concentration, which may mediate physical and behavioural
   effects in offspring.},

Title = {Competitive events during nest-building influence offspring growth and
   behaviour, but not testosterone deposition in the egg yolk in Western
   Bluebirds (Sialia mexicana)},
Journal = {IBIS},
Abstract = {The environmental stressors that females face before egg-laying, such as
   competition for resources, can impact the fitness prospects of the
   female as well as her offspring through hormone-mediated maternal
   effects. In obligate secondary cavity-nesting species, suitable
   nest-holes are a limited resource, so gaining access to nest-sites may
   require competition with other individuals. In the Western Bluebird
   Sialia mexicana, we experimentally evaluated whether female exposure to
   increased competition for nest cavities (reduced available nest-holes
   plus exposure to a competitor's decoy and vocalizations) during the
   period of nest construction affects her offspring's developmental
   trajectory, survival probability and behaviour through an increase in
   the concentration of testosterone in the egg yolk. Chicks from
   experimental females had a lower body mass at age 3 days, followed by a
   faster growth rate during the rapid growth phase, a slower growth rate
   during the slow growth phase and larger tarsus at age 15 days (only male
   offspring). Additionally, experimental chicks exhibited a lower
   breathing rate. However, female exposure to stronger competition for
   nest cavities during nest construction did not affect testosterone
   concentration in the egg yolk. Differential testosterone deposition in
   yolk is therefore apparently not the underlying mechanism of the effects
   observed, which may be attributed to changes in females' parental
   behaviour triggered by competition for breeding sites.},

Title = {Testing different forms of regulation of yolk thyroid hormone transfer
   in pied flycatchers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {223},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Hormones transferred from mothers to their offspring are considered a
   maternal tool to prepare progeny for expected environmental conditions,
   increasing maternal and offspring fitness. To flexibly influence
   offspring, mothers should be able to transmit the hormonal signals
   independent of their own hormonal status. However, the ability to
   regulate hormone transfer to the next generation is under debate. We
   studied the transfer of thyroid hormones (THs) to eggs in a bird model.
   We elevated thyroxine (T-4, the prohormone for the biologically active
   triiodothyronine, T-3) during egg laying using T-4 implants in females
   of a wild population of pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca), and
   measured the resulting plasma and yolk T-4 and T-3 levels. We found an
   increase in plasma and yolk T-4 and no change in plasma or yolk T-3
   concentration, leading to a decrease in yolk T-3/T-4 ratio in response
   to the T-4 treatment. The yolk T-3/T-4 ratio was similar to the plasma
   ratio in females during the yolking phase. This suggests that mothers
   are not able to regulate TH transfer to yolk but may regulate the T-4 to
   T-3 conversion to avoid potential costs of elevated exposure to the
   active hormone to herself and to her progeny. The absence of regulation
   in hormone transfer to eggs is in contrast to our predictions. Future
   studies on deiodinase activity that converts T-4 to T-3 in maternal and
   embryonic tissues may help our understanding of how mothers regulate
   circulating THs during breeding, as well as the embryos' role in
   converting maternal T-4 to its biologically active T-3 form during
   development.},

Title = {Developmental programming of the adrenocortical stress response by yolk
   testosterone depends on sex and life history stage},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {223},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Developmental exposure of embryos to maternal hormones such as
   testosterone in the avian egg influences the expression of multiple
   traits, with certain effects being sex specific and lasting into
   adulthood. This pleiotropy, sex dependency and persistency may be the
   consequence of developmental programming of basic systemic processes
   such as adrenocortical activity or metabolic rate. We investigated
   whether experimentally increased in ovo exposure to testosterone
   influenced hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal function, i.e. baseline and
   stress-induced corticosterone secretion, and resting metabolic rate
   (RMR) of adult male and female house sparrows (Passer domesticus). In
   previous experiments with this passerine bird we demonstrated effects of
   embryonic testosterone exposure on adult agonistic and sexual behavior
   and survival. Here we report that baseline corticosterone levels and the
   stress secretion profile of corticosterone are modified by in ovo
   testosterone in a sex-specific and life history stage-dependent manner.
   Compared with controls, males from testosterone-treated eggs had higher
   baseline corticosterone levels, whereas females from
   testosterone-treated eggs showed prolonged stress-induced corticosterone
   secretion during the reproductive but not the non-reproductive phase.
   Adult RMR was unaffected by in ovo testosterone treatment but correlated
   with integrated corticosterone stress secretion levels. We conclude that
   exposure of the embryo to testosterone programs the hypothalamus-
   pituitary-adrenal axis in a sex-specific manner that in females depends,
   in expression, on reproductive state. The modified baseline
   corticosterone levels in males and stress-induced corticosterone levels
   in females may explain some of the long-lasting effects of maternal
   testosterone in the egg on behavior and could be linked to previously
   observed reduced mortality of testosterone-treated females.},

Abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that exposure of avian embryos to androgens in
   ovo entails long-term costs in the form of oxidative damage to vital
   cells and organs in adulthood. We injected zebra finch eggs with
   testosterone (T), monitored postnatal growth, and analyzed markers of
   oxidative damage in heart and liver in mature birds. We measured
   8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine and isoprostanes, markers of oxidative damage to
   DNA and membrane lipids, respectively. T treatment (1) reduced growth
   rates of female but not male nestlings vs. controls; (2) resulted in
   less accumulation of 8-oxo-dG, but not IsoPs, in liver tissue of
   60-day-old females, but not males; and (3) a trend toward elevated
   8-oxo-dG levels in heart tissue of males and females at 60 and 180 days
   old combined. These results generally support the testosterone oxidative
   damage hypothesis, in that embryonic exposure to higher T resulted in
   damage to DNA of heart tissue in both sexes. They also suggest that
   sex-specific effects of androgens on early growth rates may carry over
   as differences in some forms of oxidative damage in adults. This
   supports a basic tenet of evolutionary aging theory that developmental
   influences early in life can be linked to costs later on.},

Abstract = {In vertebrates, thyroid hormones (THs) play an important role in the
   regulation of growth, development, metabolism, photoperiodic responses
   and migration. Maternally transferred THs are important for normal early
   phase embryonic development when embryos are not able to produce
   endogenous THs. Previous studies have shown that variation in maternal
   THs within the physiological range can influence offspring phenotype.
   Given the essential functions of maternal THs in development and
   metabolism, THs may be a mediator of life-history variation across
   species. We tested the hypothesis that differences in life histories are
   associated with differences in maternal TH transfer across species.
   Using birds as a model, we specifically tested whether maternally
   transferred yolk THs covary with migratory status, developmental mode
   and traits related to pace-of-life (e.g. basal metabolic rate, maximum
   life span). We collected un-incubated eggs (n = 1-21 eggs per species,
   median = 7) from 34 wild and captive bird species across 17 families and
   six orders to measure yolk THs {[}both triiodothyronine (T3) and
   thyroxine (T4)], compiled life-history trait data from the literature
   and used Bayesian phylogenetic mixed models to test our hypotheses. Our
   models indicated that both concentrations and total amounts of the two
   main forms of THs (T3 and T4) were higher in the eggs of migratory
   species compared to resident species, and total amounts were higher in
   the eggs of precocial species, which have longer prenatal developmental
   periods, than in those of altricial species. However, maternal yolk THs
   did not show clear associations with pace-of-life-related traits, such
   as fecundity, basal metabolic rate or maximum life span. We quantified
   interspecific variation in maternal yolk THs in birds, and our findings
   suggest higher maternal TH transfer is associated with the precocial
   mode of development and migratory status. Whether maternal THs represent
   a part of the mechanism underlying the evolution of precocial
   development and migration or a consequence of such life histories is
   currently unclear. We therefore encourage further studies to explore the
   physiological mechanisms and evolutionary processes underlying these
   patterns.},

Abstract = {Genetic variation is one of the key concepts in evolutionary biology and
   an important prerequisite of evolutionary change. However, we know very
   little about processes that modulate its levels in wild populations. In
   particular, we still are to understand why genetic variances often
   depend on environmental conditions. One of possible
   environment-sensitive modulators of observed levels of genetic variance
   are maternal effects. In this study we attempt to experimentally test
   the hypothesis that maternally transmitted agents (e.g. hormones) may
   influence the expression of genetic variance in quantitative traits in
   the offspring. We manipulated the levels of steroid hormones
   (testosterone and corticosterone) in eggs laid by blue tits in a wild
   population. Our experimental setup allowed for full crossing of genetic
   and rearing effects with the experimental manipulation. We observed that
   birds treated with corticosterone exhibited a significant decrease in
   broad-sense genetic variance of tarsus length, and an increase in this
   component in body mass on the 2nd day post-hatching. Our study
   indicates, that maternally transmitted substances such as hormones may
   have measurable impact on the levels of genetic variance and hence, on
   the evolutionary potential of quantitative traits.},
