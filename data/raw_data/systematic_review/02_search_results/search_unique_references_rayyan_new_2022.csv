Salazar.Nicholls2021333,A polymorphism in oocyte pigmentation in natural populations of the glass frog espadarana prosoblepon (Centrolenidae),"Salazar-Nicholls, M.J. and Hervas, F. and MuÃ±oz-Tobar, S.I. and Carrillo, A.-B. and Ricaurte, H. and Ron, S.R. and Romero-Carvajal, A.",International Journal of Developmental Biology,2146282,65,6-May,333-344,,,2021,UPV/EHU Press,,,10.1387/ijdb.200074ar,"The adaptive role of amphibian oocyte melanic pigmentation and its molecular control are still elusive. Here we present evidence of a polymorphism in egg pigmentation in the emerald glass frog Espadarana prosoblepon. In Ecuadorian natural populations of this species, females can lay dark brown or pale eggs that develop into normal pigmented tadpoles and adults. This trait is a sex-limited phenotype which is inherited like a recessive allele that we called pale eggs like (pel). The pel phenotype is exclusive of oocyte cortical melanic pigmentation, which is reduced in comparison to wild type (wt) dark pigmented oocytes. Consequently, pel early embryos are paler in appearance, with reduced melanic pigmentation distributed to early blastomeres and embryonic ectoderm. However, these embryos form normal melanocyte derived pigmentation. Finally, we discuss the origin of this polymorphism and propose the use of E. prosoblepon as a model to study the adaptive role of egg pigmentation. Â© 2020 UPV/EHU Press Printed in Spain. ",
Dickins2021,â€œPunishingâ€ pecks and â€œsiblicidalâ€ pecks in kittiwake (tridactyla) chicks,"Dickins, D.W.",Learning and Motivation,239690,73,NA,NA,,,2021,Academic Press Inc.,,,10.1016/j.lmot.2020.101695,"The Black-legged Kittiwake gull (Rissa tridactyla) is noted for its suite of evolutionary adaptations to its extreme cliff-nesting habitat (Cullen, 1957) which distinguish it behaviourally in a number of ways from other gulls (Laridae). One such behaviour we observed was siblicide, the death of one chick from falling out of the nest as a consequence of agonistic harassment by the other (Dickins et al., 1985). This harassment involved what we termed â€œsiblicidal pecksâ€ inflicted by the dominant chick on its younger sib, not in the context of feeding. These we distinguished observationally from â€œpunishing pecksâ€, also made by the dominant chick on its brood mate, specifically when the latter was begging for food from a parent, causing it to stop this behaviour in the short term. Though the evolution of siblicide initially seemed to present a paradox for Inclusive fitness theory it was soon seen to be a logical corollary thereof (O'Connor, 1978) (D. Mock & Parker, 1998), and dependent upon key ecological variables. A number of subsequent studies of these factors in the kittiwake, largely from the ecological and ornithological literature, are here collated, and it is considered how these might be integrated with the application of concepts from operant psychology to chick and parent behaviours (Reed, 2015), to give a full account.

In addition to maternal biochemical cues, prenatal sound is emerging as a potent alternative source of information to direct embryonic development. Recent evidence suggests that prenatal acoustic signals can program individual phenotypes for predicted postnatal environmental conditions, which improves fitness. Across taxonomic groups, embryos have now been shown to have immediate adaptive responses to external sounds and vibrations, and direct developmental effects of sound and noise are increasingly found. Establishing the full developmental, ecological, and evolutionary impact of early soundscapes will reveal how embryos interact with the external world, and potentially transform our understanding of developmental plasticity and adaptation to changing environments.

Grant2020,Across time and space: Hormonal variation across temporal and spatial scales in relation to nesting success,"Grant, A.R. and Baldan, D. and Kimball, M.G. and Malisch, J.L. and Ouyang, J.Q.",General and Comparative Endocrinology,166480,292,NA,NA,,,2020,Academic Press Inc.,,,10.1016/j.ygcen.2020.113462,"There is a renewed interest in investigating individual variation in hormone levels in relation to fitness metrics, as hormones act as mediators of life-history trade-offs. Hormone concentrations, however, are labile, responding to both internal and external stimuli, so the relationship between hormones and fitness can be non-consistent. One explanation of this inconsistent relationship is that a single hormone sample may not be representative of individual phenotypes in a free-living species. We addressed this issue by repeatedly sampling a free-living population of mountain white-crowned sparrows, Zonotrichia leucophrys oriantha, for baseline and stress-induced corticosterone (cort) and testosterone (T) across different stages of the breeding season. We measured (co)variation using three different methods, taking into account inter- and intra-individual variances, to determine whether hormone levels and the stress response are repeatable. We documented the temporal (over 3 months) and spatial (home-range) variation of individual hormone phenotypes and investigated how these components related to nesting success. At the population level, we found significant repeatability in male stress-induced cort concentrations but no repeatability in male or female baseline cort or male T concentrations. Using a new metric of intra-individual variance focusing on the stress response (profile repeatability), we found a wide range of variance scores, with most individuals showing high variation in their stress response. Similarly, we found a low level of repeatability of the reaction norm intercept and slope for the stress response across different life-history stages. Males with higher concentrations of stress-induced cort had more central home-ranges. Males with higher body condition had larger home-ranges; however, home-range size did not relate to male hormone concentrations or nesting success. We also did not find any significant relationship between variation in hormone levels and nesting success. We recommend that future studies combine both physiological and environmental components to better understand the relationship between hormones and fitness. Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.",
Sirki.U.00C3..U.00A4.20211501,Adaptive coloration in pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca)â€”The devil is in the detail,"SirkiÃ¤, P.M. and QvarnstrÃ¶m, A.",Ecology and Evolution,20457758,11,4,1501-1525,,,2021,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,,,10.1002/ece3.7048,"Understanding the origin and persistence of phenotypic variation within and among populations is a major goal in evolutionary biology. However, the eagerness to find unadulterated explanatory models in combination with difficulties in publishing replicated studies may lead to severe underestimations of the complexity of selection patterns acting in nature. One striking example is variation in plumage coloration in birds, where the default adaptive explanation often is that brightly colored individuals signal superior quality across environmental conditions and therefore always should be favored by directional mate choice. Here, we review studies on the proximate determination and adaptive function of coloration traits in male pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca). From numerous studies, we can conclude that the dark male color phenotype is adapted to a typical northern climate and functions as a dominance signal in maleâ€“male competition over nesting sites, and that the browner phenotypes are favored by relaxed intraspecific competition with more dominant male collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) in areas where the two species co-occur. However, the role of avoidance of hybridization in driving character displacement in plumage between these two species may not be as important as initially thought. The direction of female choice on male coloration in pied flycatchers is not simply as opposite in direction in sympatry and allopatry as traditionally expected, but varies also in relation to additional contexts such as climate variation. While some of the heterogeneity in the observed relationships between coloration and fitness probably indicate type 1 errors, we strongly argue that environmental heterogeneity and context-dependent selection play important roles in explaining plumage color variation in this species, which probably also is the case in many other species studied in less detail.

We discuss the utility and shortcomings of methods for studying urban adaptation. We then review diverse systems offering preliminary evidence for urban adaptation and outline a research program for advancing its study. Urban environments constitute diverse, interacting selective agents that test the limits of adaptation. Understanding urban adaptation therefore offers unique opportunities for addressing fundamental questions in evolutionary biology and for better conserving biodiversity in cities.

Hall20201242,"Adaptive seasonal shift towards investment in fewer, larger offspring: Evidence from field and laboratory studies","Hall, J.M. and Mitchell, T.S. and Thawley, C.J. and Stroud, J.T. and Warner, D.A.",Journal of Animal Ecology,218790,89,5,1242-1253,,,2020,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,,,10.1111/1365-2656.13182,"Seasonal changes in reproduction have been described for many taxa. As reproductive seasons progress, females often shift from greater energetic investment in many small offspring towards investing less total energy into fewer, better provisioned (i.e. larger) offspring. The underlying causes of this pattern have not been assessed in many systems. Two primary hypotheses have been proposed to explain these patterns. The first is an adaptive hypothesis from life-history theory: early offspring have a survival advantage over those produced later. Accordingly, selection favours females that invest in offspring quantity early in the season and offspring quality later. The second hypothesis suggests these patterns are not intrinsic but result from passive responses to seasonal changes in the environment experienced by reproducing females (i.e. maternal environment). To disentangle the causes underlying this pattern, which has been reported in brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei), we performed complementary field and laboratory studies. The laboratory study carefully controlled maternal environments and quantified reproductive patterns throughout the reproductive season for each female. The field study measured similar metrics from free ranging lizards across an entire reproductive season. In the laboratory, females increased relative effort per offspring as the reproductive season progressed; smaller eggs were laid earlier, larger eggs were laid later. Moreover, we observed significant among-individual variation in seasonal changes in reproduction, which is necessary for traits to evolve via natural selection. Because these patterns consistently emerge under controlled laboratory conditions, they likely represent an intrinsic and potentially adaptive adjustment of reproductive effort as predicted by life-history theory. The field study revealed similar trends, further suggesting that intrinsic patterns observed in the laboratory are strong enough to persist despite the environmental variability that characterizes natural habitats. The observed patterns are indicative of an adaptive seasonal shift in parental investment in response to a deteriorating offspring environment: allocating greater resources to late-produced offspring likely enhances maternal fitness.

Videla2022,Age matters: Differential effects of the exposure to elevated environmental temperatures on representative variables of the immune system in juvenile and adult female Japanese quail.,"Videla, E.A. and Tortone, S.M. and Marin, R.H. and Nazar, F.N.",Journal of Thermal Biology,3064565,107,NA,NA,,,2022,Elsevier Ltd,,,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103257,"Several days under the influence of high environmental temperature negatively impact on some immune-related variables of poultry species. However, it is little known whether this exposure affects differentially the immune response on different life stages. This study was aimed at characterizing the immune responses of juvenile and adult female Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix) when exposed to a cyclic chronic heat stressor. Independent sets of juvenile (24) and adult (21) female Japanese quail were bred under thermoneutral conditions or exposed to an increasing temperature from 24 Â°C to 34 Â°C, for 8 h along nine consecutive days (chronic heat stressor). The inflammatory response against a mitogen, the antibody production against a non-pathogenic antigen and the heterophil to lymphocyte (H/L) ratio were measured after the ninth day of chronic heat exposure. Adult females had a more robust inflammatory response compared to their juvenile counterpart. The inflammatory response, the production of antibodies, and the H/L ratio were suppressed by the chronic heat stressor in the juvenile females; while in their adult counterpart, the production of antibodies was not affected by the chronic heat stress. Under the exposure of high environmental temperatures, juvenile females would be more susceptible to potentially harmful pathogens that require a robust immune response, while their adult counterparts would be able to mount an optimal acquired immune response against pathogens requiring this type of response. Our findings suggest that while heat stress during breeding should be avoided in both juvenile and adult females, more precautions should be taken during early life stages. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd ",

The association of these factors with inflammation and the modification of the mechanism of hepatic drug-metabolizing CYP isoform regulation are also presented because changes in the expression of CYP isoforms in the liver may result in subsequent changes to a marker substance used for testing CYP activity, thus providing a simple way to control the liver regeneration process or the dangerous stimulation of hepatocarcinogenesis.

[Methods] The full sequence of the pig CYP11A1 gene coding region was obtained through gene cloning and amplification technology, and its sequence characteristics was analyzed. Luciferase activity test was used to identify the core promoter region, and bioinformatics was used to identify the methylation sites and potential transcription factor binding sites of CYP11A1. Western blot, RT-qPCR and Chromatin immunoprecipitation(ChIP) were used to analyze the regulatory function of transcription factor NR2C1 on porcine CYP11A1 gene transcription. [Results] The total length of the coding region of the pig CYP11A1 gene was 1563 bp, which was highly conserved in the evolution of mammals. The core promoter region of pig CYP11A1 gene was located at -398 to -108 bp(transcription start site was+1). Sequence analysis revealed that there were many important transcription factor binding elements on it, including NR2C1, SOX10, NFIX and ELF5, etc. The activity of the core promoter region of the CYP11A1 gene was promoted by NR2C1, and the expression of the CYP11A1 gene in porcine ovarian granulosa cells cultured in vitro also was significantly up-regulated. [Conclusions] Our findings indicated that the mammalian CYP11A1 gene was highly conserved in the evolutionary process and its transcription in porcine ovarian granulosa cells was promoted by the transcription factor NR2C1.

Two of the most common methods for quantifying animal personality are standardized behavioural assays and focal animal sampling. We evaluated whether assays and focals provided similar animal personality measures in a wild population of free-ranging North American red squirrels, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, by comparing the among-individual correlations of traits between methods. Assays described two behavioural axesâ€”one associated with movement behaviours and another associated with antagonistic behaviours towards conspecifics. Focals described two additional behavioural axesâ€”one associated with movement and territorial behaviours, and another associated with the trade-off between vigilant and feeding behaviours. Although we found evidence of high trait repeatability for behavioural axes measured with assays, both focal behavioural axes had low trait repeatability regardless of whether among-individual differences in the social environment were controlled for (i.e. to account for â€˜pseudopersonalityâ€™). We also found no among-individual correlations between assay and focal behavioural axes. The lack of correlation between methods may be because the dominant axes of variation differ between methods or because of the low trait repeatability of focals due to high behavioural plasticity. Given this, we conclude that assays will likely remain the mainstay for measuring consistent among-individual differences in behaviour given their ability to standardize for environmental conditions.

Hematological parameters such as white blood-cell counts have emerged as a valuable tool to understand this variation by assessing the immunological status of individuals. These tools have long revealed that vertebrate cellular immune systems are highly plastic and respond to injury and infection. However, cellular immune systems may also be able to anticipate a high risk of injury from environmental cues (e.g., predation-related cues) and respond plastically ahead of time. We studied white blood-cell (leukocyte) profiles in African cichlids Pelvicachromis taeniatus that were raised for 4Â years under different levels of perceived predation risk. In a split-clutch design, we raised fish from hatching onwards under chronic exposure to either conspecific alarm cues (communicating high predation risk) or a distilled water control treatment. Differential blood analysis revealed that alarm cue-exposed fish had twice as many lymphocytes in peripheral blood as did controls, a condition called lymphocytosis. The presence of a higher number of lymphocytes makes the cellular immune response more potent, which accelerates the removal of invading foreign antigens from the bloodstream, and, therefore, may be putatively beneficial in the face of injury. This observed lymphocytosis after long-term exposure to conspecific alarm cues constitutes first evidence for an anticipatory and adaptive plastic response of the cellular immune system to future immunological challenges.

Male songbirds often engage in singing contests where they vary the type and timing of signals and provide eavesdropping individuals with information about their competitiveness. How this information is used and its effect on subsequent spatial behaviour and reproductive decisions of eavesdroppers is not well understood. Here we tested whether great tits use information gathered by eavesdropping on male singing interactions to assess rivals and (potential) mates. We used interactive playback experiments to engage territorial males in song contests with either a more (song overlapping and more persistent singing) or less challenging (song alternating and less persistent singing) intruder. We followed male and female movements by automated radiotracking, determined paternity using microsatellite analysis and maternal investment by quantifying egg weights and provisioning behaviour. We expected that mates of males exposed to the challenging treatment would subsequently foray more often off territory to assess other males and potential extrapair mates and invest less in their broods. Moreover, we expected that neighbours would adjust their foraying behaviour according to information gained by eavesdropping. Females, however, did not alter their foraying behaviour or brood investment and neither female nor male neighbours changed their visiting behaviour to playback territories. Our results provide no evidence that females used information gathered by eavesdropping on asymmetric song interactions in reproductive decisions or that song interactions affected movements across territories in the neighbourhood. Overlapping or singing for a longer time on an intruded upon territory may not always be perceived as a higher level of threat, and reproductive decisions and assessment of familiar individuals are likely to be based on multiple sources of information rather than on a single interaction.

Fresneau2020899,Are offspring begging levels exaggerated beyond the parental optimum? Evidence from a bidirectional selection experiment,"Fresneau, N. and Estramil, N. and MÃ¼ller, W.",Journal of Evolutionary Biology,1010061X,33,7,899-910,,,2020,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,,,10.1111/jeb.13621,"Parental care involves elaborate behavioural interactions between parents and their offspring, with offspring stimulating their parents via begging to provision resources. Thus, begging has direct fitness benefits as it enhances offspring growth and survival. It is nevertheless subject to a complex evolutionary trajectory, because begging may serve as a means for the offspring to manipulate parents in the context of evolutionary conflicts of interest. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that begging is coadapted and potentially genetically correlated with parental care traits as a result of social selection. Further experiments on the causal processes that shape the evolution of begging are therefore essential. We applied bidirectional artificial selection on begging behaviour, using canaries (Serinus canaria) as a model species. We measured the response to selection, the consequences for offspring development, changes in parental care traits, here the rate of parental provisioning, as well as the effects on reproductive success. After three generations of selection, offspring differed in begging behaviour according to our artificial selection regime: nestlings of the high begging line begged significantly more than nestlings of the low begging line. Intriguingly, begging less benefitted the nestlings, as reflected by on average significantly higher growth rates, and increased reproductive success in terms of a higher number of fledglings in the low selected line. Begging could thus represent an exaggerated trait, possibly because parentâ€“offspring conflict enhanced the selection on begging. We did not find evidence that we co-selected on parental provisioning, which may be due to the lack of power, but may also suggest that the evolution of begging is probably not constrained by a genetic correlation between parental provisioning and offspring begging.

We tested whether the digit ratio in the gecko Ptyodactylus guttatus was associated with behaviors attributed to brain laterality. We examined risk-taking behavior (time spent under cover), foot preference (which foot was the first to start moving) and the side from which geckos bypassed an obstacle, in relation to the digit ratio. Geckos with longer fourth digits on their left hind foot (higher digit ratio) spent more time under cover. Geckos starting to move with their left leg were much more likely to bypass obstacles from the right side, and vice versa. This is the first evidence of laterality being associated with the digit ratio in reptiles. Comparisons among vertebrates are needed in order to decipher the evolutionary origin of the commonalities and peculiarities of brain asymmetry and disentangle the patterns and drivers of our evolutionary tree.

Immunosuppression can be caused by pathogens such as chicken infectious anemia virus, infectious bursal disease virus, reovirus, and some retroviruses (e.g., reticuloendotheliosis virus). Mycotoxins and stress, often caused by poor management practices, can also cause immunosuppression. The effects on the innate and acquired immune responses and the mechanisms by which mycotoxins, stress, and infectious agents cause immunosuppression are discussed. Immunoevasion is a common ploy by which viruses neutralize or evade immune responses. DNA viruses such as herpesvirus and poxvirus have multiple genes, some of them host-derived, which interfere with effective innate or acquired immune responses. RNA viruses may escape acquired humoral and cellular immune responses by mutations in protective antigenic epitopes (e.g., avian influenza viruses), while accessory nonstructural proteins or multifunctional structural proteins interfere with the interferon system (e.g., Newcastle disease virus).

In contrast to males, almost all females of this species desert during the chick-rearing and post-fledging periods. Because of the expected link between corticosterone, prolactin and parental investment, we hypothesized that males and females should differ in circulating prolactin and corticosterone concentrations. Baseline hormone concentrations did not differ between males and females. In both sexes, prolactin and corticosterone concentrations decreased and increased in response to acute stress (30 min after capture), respectively. Baseline and stress-induced prolactin concentrations decreased significantly in both sexes with advancing brood age. As expected, males had significantly higher stress-induced prolactin concentrations than females. None of the nine males released after being held in captivity for 24 h deserted, whereas four (29%) of the 14 females kept in captivity for 24 h did so. Altogether, these results suggest that higher prolactin concentrations may be involved in the maintenance of parental care under stress. However, there was no statistically significant difference in stress-induced hormone levels between males, females that deserted and those that returned to the nest after prolonged stress (24 h). Our data indicate that males are probably more resistant to stress as regards the continuation of parental care. The pattern of male and female behavioural and hormonal responses to stress partially predicts their behaviour in terms of natural desertion. Â© 2021 The Authors",

In cooperative breeders, helpers also provide care by feeding the young. However, how helpers of different sex and relatedness to the offspring respond to begging behaviour has rarely been studied in cooperatively breeding species, which limits our understanding of the indirect and/or direct benefits that helpers may obtain by responding to offspring demand. Here, we used a cooperatively breeding bird, the sociable weaver, Philetairus socius, to investigate how nest intervisit intervals of breeders and different types of helpers, distinguished by sex and relatedness, varied with acoustic begging. Moreover, we tested whether these different classes of provisioners experienced distinct levels of begging. Our results show that only breeding males, but not breeding females or helpers of any sex and relatedness to the nestlings, returned faster to the nest to feed after experiencing more begging calls. When contrasted directly, we confirmed a statistically supported difference in responses to begging between male and female breeders. Surprisingly, second-order relatives experienced more begging calls than the other classes of more related helpers and breeders. These results show that we might find differences in how provisioners respond to begging levels when classifying group members according to their potential fitness gains. In sociable weavers, the benefits and costs of adjusting feeding efforts to begging seem to differ with sex and life history stage.

Another objective was to answer the question whether the behavioural differences between adult birds would be evident already in the chick period or whether they are an effect of the further modifying impact of the environment. 60 green-legged partridge, 60 Polbar, and 60 Leghorn chicks were used in the experiments. The chicks hatched in a flock where hens were previously assessed with behavioural tests and the corticosterone levels in their feathers was determined, indicating significant differences in the temperament and stress level between the breeds. Five tests were carried out: two on competitiveness, activity, interest and fearfulness/curiosity. The experiments revealed considerable differences between the chicks. The Zk birds coped better with situations requiring swiftness and initiative. The Pb chicks were slower than Zk and Lg and did not make quick decisions. Hence, a lower number of these birds entering and leaving the test cage and staying inside was recorded. The Zk chicks exhibited a higher level of fearfulness than the other breeds. In terms of the environment enrichment elements, sand and woodchips were more attractive to the Zk chicks, whereas the Lg and Pb birds preferred pecking the string. No differences in the time of undertaking the analysed activities were found between the breeds. Â© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",
Griebel2020,Benefits of an anti-parasite treatment are influenced by within-brood size variation in Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor),"Griebel, I.A. and Dawson, R.D.",Auk,48038,137,2,NA,,,2020,Oxford University Press,,,10.1093/auk/ukz078,"In all animals, susceptibility to parasites can differ among individuals. Young, nest-bound birds are exposed to a diversity of nest-dwelling ectoparasites that typically feed on their blood. Within broods, hatching asynchrony creates size hierarchies that result in morphological and physiological variation among nest mates, and susceptibility to parasites also may vary predictably with this size hierarchy. Our objective was to use a broad-spectrum, anti-parasite drug, ivermectin (IVM), to treat individual nestling Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) and assess how nestling susceptibility to parasites varied both within and among broods. Broods were either assigned to an IVM group, where half of the nestlings in a brood received IVM injections and half received control injections of pure sesame oil, or to a control group, where all nestlings received oil injections. We found that the IVM treatment reduced parasite loads for broods as a whole, thereby benefiting all nestlings in IVM broods and suggesting our treatment resulted in herd immunity. Specifically, nestlings from IVM broods had higher hemoglobin concentrations, regardless of whether they received injections with IVM or oil, and greater fledging success, than nestlings from control broods. On the contrary, IVM treatment did not strongly affect nestling morphology, with only marginal effects on the growth rate of ninth primary feathers, and the effects of the treatment on 2 other morphological traits depending on temporal factors. Variation in size within broods, however, influenced the chance of an individual fledging, which increased with relative size within a brood, but only under lower parasite loads (i.e. IVM broods). By experimentally manipulating nestling susceptibility to parasites, we have demonstrated variation in nestling response to an anti-parasite treatment both within and among broods, and future studies should investigate the underlying mechanism for why certain nestlings along the brood size hierarchy are more susceptible to parasites.

Eyck2020,Birds from matched developmental environments breed faster,"Eyck, H.J.F. and Crino, O.L. and Kraft, F.-L.O.H. and Jessop, T.S. and Buchanan, K.L.",Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,3405443,74,2,NA,,,2020,Springer,,,10.1007/s00265-020-2798-1,"Abstract: The developmental environment an animal experiences can have a pervasive and sustained effect on phenotype throughout its life. Animals exposed to suboptimal conditions during development can experience physiological trade-offs, leading to seemingly negative phenotypic changes in later life that have been hypothesised to have detrimental effects on fitness. However, few studies have investigated how exposure to suboptimal developmental conditions affects an animalâ€™s reproductive behavior and fitness. Here, we determine if elevated levels of corticosterone (CORT; the dominant avian stress hormone) during development affect fitness via changes in reproductive investment in adult zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). To do this, we exposed nestling zebra finches to either CORT supplemented or control treatments and assessed their mate selection and reproductive investment as adults, using free choice breeding experiments. We found that breeding pairs of birds from matched developmental treatments (CORT or control) had a shorter latency to lay clutches compared to pairs with mismatched developmental treatments. We found no indication that clutch size or egg mass were affected by developmental treatment. Also, we found no evidence that birds choose mates to match their own developmental treatment. Our results demonstrate that developmental experience may affect reproductive investment through changes to reproductive timing and add to the literature suggesting that pairs with similar developmental backgrounds can coordinate their reproduction more effectively. Significance statement: Developmental stress may reduce the fitness of a breeding pair as a result of its detrimental effect on phenotype and performance. Alternatively, individuals could use indicators of developmental stress to influence mate choice in order to compensate for a poor start to life. Previous studies suggest that birds do assortatively mate by developmental environment, but this has not been tested in a free choice mating context. Using a free choice breeding experiment, we show that pairs of breeding birds lay eggs faster when they have matching developmental environments, regardless of the quality of their developmental environment. This evidence suggests that assortatively mated pairs can potentially offset a bad start to life and maintain fitness in spite of the deleterious effects of developmental stress.

Since the reemergence of this field in the 1970s, we learned that left-right differences of brain and behavior exist throughout the animal kingdom and pay off in terms of sensory, cognitive, and motor efficiency. Ontogenetically, lateralization starts in many species with asymmetrical expression patterns of genes within the Nodal cascade that set up the scene for later complex interactions of genetic, environmental, and epigenetic factors. These take effect during different time points of ontogeny and create asymmetries of neural networks in diverse species. As a result, depending on task demands, left-or right-hemispheric loops of feedforward or feedback projections are then activated and can tempo-rarily dominate a neural process. In addition, asymmetries of commissural transfer can shape lateralized processes in each hemisphere. It is still unclear if interhemispheric interactions depend on an inhibition/excitation dichotomy or instead adjust the contralateral temporal neural structure to delay the other hemisphere or synchronize with it during joint action. As outlined in our review, novel animal models and approaches could be established in the last decades, and they already produced a substantial increase of knowledge. Since there is practically no realm of human perception, cognition, emotion, or action that is not affected by our lateralized neural organization, insights from these comparative studies are crucial to understand the functions and pathologies of our asymmetric brain.

However, the short- and long-term ecological consequences of such artificial feeding remain inconclusive. In seasonal environments, timing of breeding is a crucial aspect that can strongly influence reproductive output and ultimately fitness. Individual condition at the start of the breeding season is especially important in determining breeding success, by influencing the onset of and investment in breeding. However, empirical evidence on the effects of winter feeding on avian breeding performance remain equivocal. We studied onset of reproduction (laying date) and breeding investment (clutch size) over seven consecutive seasons in a population of wild great tits Parus major in southern Sweden. During the first three years of study, no experimental manipulation was undertaken, while over the last four years the study area was exposed to either supplemented or unmanipulated winter feeding conditions. Breeding was positively affected by supplementary feeding during winter, as birds breeding in the supplemented area increased their clutch size compared to birds from the control area, although laying date remained unaffected by winter feeding. Since differences in clutch size were absent during the three years prior to the experimental manipulation, the results suggest that winter supplementary feeding, and not inherent differences between the two areas, was the reason for the observed effect. Both breeding parameters varied over the years of study, although the effects of the experimental manipulation on clutch size remained consistent, which suggests a carry-over effect of winter feeding on subsequent breeding performance.

One-hundred twenty 52-week-old laying hens were raised in three temperature-controlled facilities with constant humidity (50% RH), either normal temperature (LT; 22Â°C) or heat stress considered being moderate (MT; 27Â°C) or severe (HT; 32Â°C) for 42 days. Feed intakes were consistently low (p < 0.01) in HT hens compared with those in LT or MT over the period of 42 days. Egg production kept markedly (p < 0.05) or numerically (p > 0.05) low in hens exposed to HT vs. LT or MT. Egg mass and egg weight were consistently low (p < 0.01) in hens exposed to HT compared with those raised under LT or MT. On the other hand, feed conversion ratio and frequency of dirty and cracked eggs were not significantly affected (p > 0.05) during the experimental period. HT-exposed hens consistently had lowered (p < 0.05) eggshell thickness and breaking strength, eggshell weight, and plasma Ca, P, and Mg levels compared with LT- or MT-treated hens. HT hens had lower (p < 0.01) relative oviduct weight and less number of large yellow follicles compared with those raised under LT or MT conditions at 42 days. Tibia traits measured at 42 days were not affected by any of heat treatments. Fecal volatile fatty acids tended to be higher in HT-exposed laying hens throughout the experiment. It was noted that digestibilities of neutral detergent fiber and dry matter were lowest (p < 0.05) in hens exposed to HT vs. LT or MT environments. Our study suggests that heat stress could lower laying performance, egg quality, and physiological parameters that are coupled with alterations in gut metabolites and mineral/lipid metabolism. The findings emerged from this study will help us design the nutritional and environmental strategies to mitigate the negative effect of heat stress on laying hens.

Although testosterone was thought to be a key mediator of maternal effects in birds, we now know that vertebrate embryos actively regulate their exposure to maternal testosterone through steroid metabolism, suggesting testosterone metabolites, not testosterone, may elicit the observed phenotypic effects. To address the role steroid metabolism plays in mediating yolk testosterone effects, we used European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) eggs to characterize the timing of testosterone metabolism and determine whether etiocholanolone, a prominent metabolite of testosterone in avian embryos, is capable of affecting early embryonic development. Tritiated testosterone was injected into freshly laid eggs to characterize steroid movement and metabolism during early development. Varying levels of etiocholanolone were also injected into eggs, with incubation for either 3 or 5 days, to test whether etiocholanolone influences the early growth of embryonic tissues. The conversion of testosterone to etiocholanolone was initiated within 12 h of injection, but the increase in etiocholanolone was transient, indicating that etiocholanolone is also subject to metabolism, and that exposure to maternal etiocholanolone is limited to a short period during early development. Exogenous etiocholanolone manipulation had no significant effect on the growth rate of the embryos or extraembryonic membranes early in development. Thus, the conversion of testosterone to etiocholanolone may be an inactivation pathway that buffers the embryo from maternal steroids, with any effects of yolk testosterone resulting from testosterone that escapes metabolism; alternatively, etiocholanolone may influence processes other than growth or take additional time to manifest.

Here we investigated the consequences of stress-induced prenatal maternal effects on quail chicksâ€™ behaviour and maternal behaviour. We evaluated how adoptive quail mothers (unstressed) raised chicks of females that had either been stressed (PS) or were non-stressed (NPS) during laying. We demonstrated previously that our social stress procedure during laying increases levels of egg yolk steroid and chicksâ€™ emotional reactivity during the postnatal period. We found that, compared to NPS mothers, PS mothers remained closer to their chicks, were aggressed and neglected them less, emitted more maternal vocalisations and called their chicks more when they were separated. Moreover, PS chicks made more requests on their mother. Our results show that mothers responded to chicksâ€™ behavioural changes caused by prenatal stress by adapting their maternal behaviour. As exemplified here, for the first time in birds, prenatal environment can affect postnatal maternal behaviour by changing their offspring's behaviour. Â© 2020",

This information may be useful for monitoring and managing populations of cryptic, endangered, and invasive species. Consequently, we assessed the effects of food availability, clutch, and sex on the growth of invasive Burmese pythons (Python bivittatus Kuhl) from the Greater Everglades Ecosystem in Florida, USA. Though little is known from the wild, Burmese pythons have been physiological model organisms for decades, with most experimental research sourcing individuals from the pet trade. Here, we used 60 hatchlings collected as eggs from the nests of two wild pythons, assigned them to High or Low feeding treatments, and monitored growth and meal consumption for 12 weeks, a period when pythons are thought to grow very rapidly. None of the 30 hatchlings that were offered food prior to their fourth week post-hatching consumed it, presumably because they were relying on internal yolk stores. Although only two clutches were used in the experiment, we found that nearly all phenotypic variation was explained by clutch rather than feeding treatment or sex. Hatchlings from clutch 1 (C1) grew faster and were longer, heavier, in better body condition, ate more frequently, and were bolder than hatchlings from clutch 2 (C2), regardless of food availability. On average, C1 and C2 hatchling snout-vent length (SVL) and weight grew 0.15 cm d-1 and 0.10 cm d-1, and 0.20 g d-1 and 0.03 g d-1, respectively. Additional research may be warranted to determine whether these effects remain with larger clutch sample sizes and to identify the underlying mechanisms and fitness implications of this variation to help inform risk assessments and management.

In addition to these climate extremes, the freshwater realm is impacted by the exposure to various classes of chemicals emitted by anthropogenic activities. Currently, there is limited knowledge on how the combined exposure to HWs and chemicals affects the structure and functioning of freshwater ecosystems. Here, we review the available literature describing the single and combined effects of HWs and chemicals on different levels of biological organization, to obtain a holistic view of their potential interactive effects. We only found a few studies (13 out of the 61Â studies included in this review) that investigated the biological effects of HWs in combination with chemical pollution. The reported interactive effects of HWs and chemicals varied largely not only within the different trophic levels but also depending on the studied endpoints for populations or individuals. Hence, owing also to the little number of studies available, no consistent interactive effects could be highlighted at any level of biological organization. Moreover, we found an imbalance towards single species and population experiments, with only five studies using a multitrophic approach. This results in a knowledge gap for relevant community and ecosystem level endpoints, which prevents the exploration of important indirect effects that can compromise food web stability. Moreover, this knowledge gap impairs the validity of chemical risk assessments and our ability to protect ecosystems. Finally, we highlight the urgency of integrating extreme events into multiple stressors studies and provide specific recommendations to guide further experimental research in this regard.

Its cost is high because eggs contain all the resources needed for the development of an embryo. Variation in size and quality of eggs can have important long-term consequences for offspring survival. Hatching asynchrony is known to influence sibling competition in many bird species. Last-hatched chicks will have a competitive disadvantage throughout the pre-fledgling period because they are smaller. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of hatching asynchrony and egg size variation on the growth and fledging success of Magellanic penguin Spheniscus magellanicus chicks after disentangling the effects of parental condition. We simultaneously manipulated egg size dimorphism, hatching asynchrony and parental condition by performing a cross-fostering experiment, creating broods with controlled egg size dimorphism and hatching asynchrony in a colony of Magellanic penguins located in Isla Quiroga, Santa Cruz, Argentina. We found that hatching asynchrony had a negative effect on last-hatched chicks, but this disadvantage was mitigated by egg size dimorphism in their favor. Moreover, females in good condition invest more in second than in first chicks, which, added to a greater investment by foster fathers, leading to offspring fledging in good condition. On the contrary, for the first-hatched chicks, we found that body condition of the biological father was an important factor for their growth. We conclude that raising more than one chick seems to be a decision based on parental condition throughout the breeding season. Â© 2021 The Authors.

In obligate secondary cavity-nesting species, suitable nest-holes are a limited resource, so gaining access to nest-sites may require competition with other individuals. In the Western Bluebird Sialia mexicana, we experimentally evaluated whether female exposure to increased competition for nest cavities (reduced available nest-holes plus exposure to a competitor's decoy and vocalizations) during the period of nest construction affects her offspring's developmental trajectory, survival probability and behaviour through an increase in the concentration of testosterone in the egg yolk. Chicks from experimental females had a lower body mass at age 3 days, followed by a faster growth rate during the rapid growth phase, a slower growth rate during the slow growth phase and larger tarsus at age 15 days (only male offspring). Additionally, experimental chicks exhibited a lower breathing rate. However, female exposure to stronger competition for nest cavities during nest construction did not affect testosterone concentration in the egg yolk. Differential testosterone deposition in yolk is therefore apparently not the underlying mechanism of the effects observed, which may be attributed to changes in females' parental behaviour triggered by competition for breeding sites.

It is believed that the pituitary hormone prolactin plays an important role in such allocation processes. Incubation does not solely imply the active warming of the eggs but also the active egg-turning to facilitate absorption of albumen by the embryo, reduce malposition and prevent the embryo from adhering to the inner shell membrane. However, how prolactin secretion is related to egg-turning behaviors is presently poorly addressed. In addition, several environmental contaminants can affect parental care behaviors through their endocrine disrupting properties but the effects of such contaminants on egg-turning behaviors remain so far unexplored. Using artificial eggs equipped with miniaturized data loggers, we investigated the relationships between egg-turning behaviors, prolactin secretion and contaminants burden in Arctic black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla). Specifically, we examined the relationships between blood concentrations of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), organochlorines (OCs), mercury (Hg), plasma prolactin levels and both egg-turning frequency and angular change. We also incorporated baseline corticosterone levels since this glucocorticoid is known to affect parental care. Plasma prolactin levels were positively related to angular change in female kittiwakes while corticosterone was not related to egg-turning behaviors in either sex. Hg was not related to egg-turning behaviors in either sex. We found contrasting associations between OCs and PFASs, since polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were negatively associated with angular change in females, contrary to linear perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOSlin) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) which were positively related to egg-turning frequency and angular change in both sexes. Additionally, PFASs concentrations were positively related to prolactin levels in female kittiwake. The possible stimulation of prolactin secretion by PFASs could therefore make adult kittiwakes to allocate more time taking care of their eggs, and thus possibly modify the trade-off between spending enough time caring for the clutch and obtaining enough nutrients at sea.

Studies assessing early HPA axis activation often rely on collection of blood samples to evaluate circulating glucocorticoid levels. However, blood sampling in small altricial young is invasive, limited by animal size, and not sufficient to provide detailed information about hormone exposure over protracted periods of time. We tested the use of feather corticosterone as an alternative method to assess HPA axis activity early in life in free-living, altricial chicks, for whom timing of growth of first feathers coincides with a period of rapid growth, development of the HPA axis, and reliance on parental care. We investigated (1) whether ecologically relevant bouts of experimental cooling prior to the onset of homeothermyâ€”conditions known to elevate circulating corticosteroneâ€”are reflected in changes of feather corticosterone deposition in Eastern bluebird (Sialia sialis) chicks, and (2) whether such changes occurred in a sex-dependent manner. We found that cooling during the first week of life resulted in elevated feather corticosterone in first-grown feathers of experimentally cooled chicks relative to controls. The timing of deposition of corticosterone in feathers in response to temperature treatments was delayed in females compared to males. Results indicate that the hormone deposition in feather tissues of altricial nestlings reflects exposure to environmental stimuli, and can thus provide a minimally invasive tool for assessing HPA activity in early life. The development of the HPA axis, or its activation in response to environmental stimuli early in life, may also occur in a sex-dependent manner in altricial birds. Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc. ",

Cooler temperatures extend development time and can increase the amount of energy required to achieve hatching success, which can pose fitness consequences later in life. Yet, for locally-adapted populations, genetic variation can oppose environmental variation across ecological gradients, known as countergradient variation (CnGV). Biologists often seek to understand the presence of phenotypic variation, yet the absence of such variation across environmental gradients can also reveal insights into the mechanisms underlying local adaptation. While evidence for genetic variation opposing environmental variation in physiological rates has been summarized in other taxa, the generality of CnGV variation in reptiles is yet unknown. Here I present a summary of studies measuring development time and metabolic rates in locally-adapted populations across thermal clines for 15 species of reptiles across 8 families. CnGV in development time is found to be common, while no clear pattern emerges for the thermal sensitivity of metabolic rates across locally-adapted populations. CnGV in development time may be an adaptive response in order to decrease the costly development in cool climates, however, empirical work is needed to disentangle plastic from genetic responses, and to uncover potentially general mechanisms of local thermal adaptation in reptiles.

Then a surge of recent studies demonstrating the effects of parental age on offspring telomeres in diverse taxa are reviewed. In doing so, important areas for future research and experimental approaches that will enhance the understanding of how and when these effects likely occur are highlighted.

However, the predictions of these frameworks may no longer hold if distributions are skewed. Despite this, phenotypic skew has never been decomposed, meaning the fundamental assumptions of quantitative genetics remain untested. Here we demonstrate that the substantial phenotypic skew in the body size of juvenile blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) is driven by environmental factors. Although skew had little impact on our predictions of selection response in this case, our results highlight the impact of skew on the estimation of inheritance and selection. Specifically, the nonlinear parentâ€“offspring regressions induced by skew, alongside selective disappearance, can strongly bias estimates of heritability. The ubiquity of skew and strong directional selection on juvenile body size imply that heritability is commonly overestimated, which may in part explain the discrepancy between predicted and observed trait evolution.

However, it also imposes certain costs, associated with facilitated pathogen transmission and social stress. The cost-benefit ratio is not similar for all the birds in a colony and it might be mediated by nest density. To investigate the influence of nest density on cell-mediated immune function and on physiological condition of nestlings, we arranged a cross-fostering experiment in three breeding colonies of black-headed gulls Chroicocephalus ridibundus. First, we exchanged eggs between plots of high and low nest density. Afterwards, we performed phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) skin test and we measured blood haemoglobin concentration in nearly 350 nestlings from experimental (exchanged) and control (non-exchanged) groups. Results: We found that PHA response was lowest in high nest density control group, indicating that depressed immune function of offspring, likely caused by social stress, can be considered as a cost of colonial breeding. Contrastingly, body condition of nestlings was the poorest in low density control group. Conclusion: Nestlings hatched and raised in high nest density plots did not have higher blood haemoglobin concentration in comparison to other study groups. Furthermore, they were affected with depressed cell mediated immune function, which is possibly driven by combined maternal (corticosteroid hormones deposited in yolk) and environmental (elevated social stress) effects. These results indicate that breeders from high nest densities do not benefit by rising offspring in better quality, in terms of immune function and body condition, although, in the light of previous studies, high nest densities are occupied by birds of higher individual quality, than low density areas. Our study provides a novel insight into the mechanisms of density-dependence that govern fitness of colonially nesting birds. Â© 2021, The Author(s).",
Bebus2020,Development of the corticosterone stress response differs among passerine species,"Bebus, S.E. and Jones, B.C. and Anderson, R.C.",General and Comparative Endocrinology,166480,291,NA,NA,,,2020,Academic Press Inc.,,,10.1016/j.ygcen.2020.113417,"Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones which increase dramatically in response to a physical or perceived stressor. However, developing young of altricial species typically have a damped glucocorticoid stress response. The developmental hypothesis posits that the physiological stress response should develop concurrently with an individual's ability to respond to a challenge. The dampened response may benefit an organism, as chronic exposure to glucocorticoids can have short- and long-term detrimental effects, and altricial young are unable to escape most stressors. However, we do not know if or why species with similar ontogeny vary in their development of the physiological stress response. We assessed levels of baseline and stress-induced corticosterone (the main avian glucocorticoid) in six passerine species with varying life-history strategies, including a brood parasite, the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater). Circulating baseline corticosterone levels increased with nestling age for all species. Stress-induced corticosterone levels sampled at 15-min post-capture significantly increased with nestling age at a similar rate and magnitude in brown-headed cowbirds, eastern phoebes (Sayornis phoebe), hooded warblers (Setophaga citrina), red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), and song sparrows (Melospiza melodia). However, gray catbird (Dumetella carolinensis) nestlings showed an extremely dampened elevation in corticosterone in response to stress, even near fledge. Gray catbirds are unusual among songbirds, as they are open-ended song learners. Stress during development can profoundly influence avian song learning and performance abilities. However, further study is necessary to determine if there is a relationship between nestling adrenocortical activity and open- versus closed-ended song learning. Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc. ",

Intergenerational effects of early-life conditions may affect offspring phenotype through changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA). However, such effects remain largely untested in altricial birds. Here, we tested the impact of maternal and paternal developmental conditions on offspring physiology and morphology in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata). Specifically, we exposed one generation (F1) to elevated corticosterone (CORT) during development and quantified the impact on offspring (F2) phenotype. We predicted that intergenerational effects would be apparent through effects of parental developmental treatment on offspring body mass, growth, body condition, body composition, and CORT levels. We found an intergenerational impact on CORT levels, such that F2 birds reared by CORT-treated fathers had higher baseline CORT than F2 birds reared by control fathers. This result shows the potential for intergenerational effects on endocrine function, resulting from developmental conditions. We found no effect of parental treatment on F2 body mass, size, or body condition, but we found that the body mass and tarsus length for offspring and parent were correlated. Our study demonstrates the subtle effects of developmental conditions across generations and highlights the importance of distinguishing between maternal and paternal effects when studying intergenerational effects, especially for species with biparental care.

This pleiotropy, sex dependency and persistency may be the consequence of developmental programming of basic systemic processes such as adrenocortical activity or metabolic rate. We investigated whether experimentally increased in ovo exposure to testosterone influenced hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal function, i.e. baseline and stress-induced corticosterone secretion, and resting metabolic rate (RMR) of adult male and female house sparrows (Passer domesticus). In previous experiments with this passerine bird we demonstrated effects of embryonic testosterone exposure on adult agonistic and sexual behavior and survival. Here we report that baseline corticosterone levels and the stress secretion profile of corticosterone are modified by in ovo testosterone in a sex-specific and life history stage-dependent manner. Compared with controls, males from testosterone-treated eggs had higher baseline corticosterone levels, whereas females from testosterone-treated eggs showed prolonged stress-induced corticosterone secretion during the reproductive but not the non-reproductive phase. Adult RMR was unaffected by in ovo testosterone treatment but correlated with integrated corticosterone stress secretion levels. We conclude that exposure of the embryo to testosterone programs the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in a sex-specific manner that in females depends, in expression, on reproductive state. The modified baseline corticosterone levels in males and stress-induced corticosterone levels in females may explain some of the long-lasting effects of maternal testosterone in the egg on behavior and could be linked to previously observed reduced mortality of testosterone-treated females.

We used the king quail as an animal model to determine if chronic dietary exposure to crude oil in a parental population would affect morpho-physiological phenotypic variables in their immediate offspring generation. Adult quail were separated into three groups: (1) Control, and two experimental groups dietarily exposed for at least 3 weeks to (2) Low (800 PAH ng/g food), or (3) High (2,400 PAH ng/g food) levels of crude oil. To determine the parental influence on their offspring, we measured metabolic and respiratory physiology in exposed parents and in their non-exposed eggs and hatchlings. Body mass and numerous metabolic (e.g., O2 consumption, CO2 production) and respiratory (e.g., ventilation frequency and volume) variables did not vary between control and oil exposed parental groups. In contrast, blood PO2, PCO2, and SO2 varied among parental groups. Notably, water loss though the eggshell was increased in eggs from High oil level exposed parents. Respiratory variables of hatchlings did not vary between populations, but hatchlings obtained from High oil-exposed parents exhibited lower capacities to maintain body temperature while exposed to a cooling protocol in comparison to hatchlings from Low- and Control-derived parents. The present study demonstrates that parental exposure to crude oil via diet impacts some aspects of physiological performance of the subsequent first (F1) generation.

Growth performance was recorded, and blood samples were collected during cold exposure. The results showed the supplementation had altered the plasma parameters, growth performance and cold-induced oxidative stress. The increase of corticosterone and suppression of thyroid hormone was ameliorated. Supplemented groups had lower daily feed intake and feed-To-gain ratio, higher daily weight gain and better relative weights of immune organs. Plasma glucose, total protein, blood urea nitrogen and alkaline phosphatase changed as well. Oxidative stress was mollified due to the improved activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, heightened total antioxidant capacity and stable malondialdehyde. Dietary glutamine and L-carnitine improve the growth performance, nutritional status and cold stress response of broilers at low temperature, and their interaction occurred. Â© Copyright:",

Then the molecular mechanisms of sex determination and sex allocation in chicken were revealed. Therefore, TMT proteomic was applied to characterize the variation of molecular matrix between unhatched male and female egg yolks. A total of 411 proteins were identified and 35 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), including 375332005, 015809562, 763550308 (upregulated, UPs) and 1337178851, 89000557, 89000581 (downregulated, DPs), etc. were confirmed between them. Gene ontology analyses showed that DEPs were mainly involved in response to stimulus, distributed in the extracellular region and participated in binding; KEGG analyses showed that few DPs were participated in cell growth and death, transport and catabolism, signaling molecules, interaction and were enriched in ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, endocytosis, ferroptosis, etc. metabolic pathways. Moreover, most of the DEPs and related metabolic pathways were associated with sex hormones. More importantly, this study supports maternal sex-allocation theory and extends our understanding of the molecular mechanism of sex determination and differentiation in avian. Which also provides a powerful evidence for ovo sexing of unhatched fertilized domestic chicken eggs by nondestructive approach and will be of great significance to eggs processing and production.

In lower vertebrates such as tailless amphibians (Anura), the numbering of individual fingers on the forelimbs and their homology with the fingers of other vertebrates pose an unsolved problem. Based on reviewed data on anuran limb development, we argue that the correct finger numbering scheme should be based on the assumption that the first finger, not the fifth finger, was reduced on the forelimbs. We analyzed the digit ratio in the common toad (Bufo bufo, Bufonidae), a species characterized by well-developed sexual dimorphism whereby females are larger than males, using both numbering schemes present in the literature. Results: We found that the digit ratio on hindlimbs differed significantly between the sexes only in the cases of left 2D:3D, with lower digit ratios in females, and of left 3D:4D, with lower digit ratios in males. We found that sex was the only significant variable for forelimbs, differentiating 2D:3D on the left forelimb, with lower digit ratios in females; 2D:4D on the right forelimb, with lower digit ratios in males; and 3D:4D on both forelimbs, with lower digit ratios in males. These results relateÂ toÂ variant IIÂ reflecting the hypothesis that the first digit was reduced during phylogenesis. There was no relationship between the body size (SVL) of individuals and any digit ratio, excluding 2D:4D on the right forelimbs in models with age variables. Additionally, for a subset of data where individual age was known, the models indicated that age was linked to significant differences in 2D:4D and 3D:4D on the left hindlimbs, while age, SVL, and sex influenced 2D:4D on the right forelimbs. Conclusion: We emphasize the importance of the problem of the correct numbering of forelimb digits in Anura and, under the assumption that it was the fifth digit that was reduced, argue that earlier results on digit ratio in this group should be interpreted with caution. The detected relationship between digit ratio and age in amphibians expands our knowledge, indicating that the age of individuals should be included in future digit ratio studies. This relationship may also apply to studies using digit ratio as a noninvasive indicator of endocrine disruption in amphibians. Â© 2021, The Author(s). ",

Chickens of the F0 generation were fed a control (C) or RP diet, and their F1 progeny was fed a C or RP diet as well, resulting in four groups of chickens: C/C, C/RP, RP/C and RP/RP. While both direct and maternal effects were seen on body weight, breast muscle weight and abdominal fat weight in the F1 generation, the direct effect was the most dominant one. The liver transcriptome in the F1 generation showed that amino acid metabolism was up-regulated in chickens that received the control feed when compared with their respective contemporaries that received the reduced protein diet. Interestingly, chickens hatched from control-fed hens but reared on the reduced protein diet (C/RP group) activated a fatty acid metabolism, expressing more fatty acid desaturase 1 gene, fatty acid desaturase 2 gene and elongation of very long-chain fatty acids protein 2 gene, when compared with control-fed chickens hatched from control-fed hens (C/C group), while chickens hatched from reduced protein-fed hens that received themselves the same reduced protein diet (RP/RP group) triggered their glucose metabolism more, showing elevated levels of phosphofructokinase gene, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphospatase 4 and fructose-biphosphate aldolase C mRNA compared with the chickens hatched from reduced protein-fed hens but reared on a control diet (RP/C group).

Anthropogenic disturbances, due to human presence and/or activities, may be perceived as chronic stressors by wildlife and potentially lead to deleterious effects on traits related to fitness. The main objective of the present study was to highlight the effects of these anthropogenic elements on wild birds on sparsely urbanized farmland, far less studied than in urbanized areas. We investigated during four successive breeding seasons whether the anthropization level, assessed by infrastructure density around nests, and the harvesting conditions around nests may impact physiological, behavioural and life-history traits of Montagu's harrier Circus pygargus chicks. Higher anthropization levels were associated with higher basal corticosterone levels in nestlings during only one breeding season and a lower body condition at fledging for females, probably because they suffered from higher starvation than males. Nestlings reared in more anthropized areas or in harvested crops before their fledging harboured more fault bars on rectrices than those reared in less anthropized areas or in unharvested crops regardless of year and sex, which is suggestive of higher stress during development. Nestling behaviours were also impacted by anthropization level and harvesting conditions: chicks in harvested crops were more aggressive and in areas with higher anthropization levels more prone to escape than others. Because Montagu's harrier is a protected species, the impacts highlighted in the present study are a matter of concern, especially regarding farmland landscape modifications, and we advise limiting perturbations in areas where Montagu's harriers usually nest.

Because circulating GC levels increase in response to challenges, within-population variation in GCs could reflect among-individual variation in condition or experience. At the same time, individual variation in GC regulation could have causal effects on energetic balance or stress coping capacity in ways that influence fitness. Although a number of studies in vertebrates have tested whether variation in GCs among individuals predicts components of fitness, it is not clear whether there are consistent patterns across taxa. Here we present the first phylogenetic meta-analysis testing whether variation in GCs is associated with survival and reproductive success across vertebrates. At the same time, we introduce and test predictions about a potentially important mediator of GC-fitness relationships: life history context. We suggest that strong context-dependence in the fitness benefit of maintaining elevated GCs could obscure consistent patterns between GCs and fitness across taxa. Meta-analyses revealed that baseline and stress-induced GCs were consistently negatively correlated with reproductive success. This relationship did not differ depending on life history context. In contrast, the relationships between GCs and survival were highly context dependent, differing according to life history strategy. Both baseline and stress-induced GCs were more strongly negatively associated with survival in longer-lived populations and species. Stress-induced GCs were also more positively associated with survival in organisms that engage in relatively more valuable reproductive attempts. Fecal GCs did not correlate with survival or reproductive success. We also found that experimental increases in GCs reduced both survival and reproductive success; however, evidence of publication bias and the small sample size suggest that more data is required to confirm this conclusion. Overall, these results support the prediction that GC-fitness relationships can be strongly context dependent, and suggest that incorporating life history may be particularly important for understanding GC-survival relationships.

Identifying the factor(s) that mediate this trade-off has proven difficult, however, especially at the among-species level. In this study, we examined a series of potentially interrelated traits in a community of temperate-zone passerine birds to help understand the putative causes and consequences of variation in early-life growth among species. First, we examined whether nest predation risk (a proven driver of interspecific variation in growth and development rates) was correlated with species-level patterns of incubation duration and nestling period length. We then assessed whether proxies for growth rate covaried with mean trait covariance strength (i.e., phenotypic correlations (rp), which can be a marker of early-life stress) among body mass, tarsus length, and wing length at fledging. Finally, we examined whether trait covariance strength at fledging was related to postfledging survival. We found that higher nest predation risk was correlated with faster skeletal growth and that our proxies for growth corresponded with increased trait covariance strength (rp), which subsequently, correlated with higher mortality in the next life stage (postfledging period). These results provide an indication that extrinsic pressures (nest predation) impact rates of growth, and that there are costs of rapid growth across species, expressed as higher mean rp and elevated postfledging mortality. The link between higher levels of trait covariance at fledging and increased mortality is unclear, but increased trait covariance strength may reflect reduced phenotypic flexibility (i.e., phenotypic canalization), which may limit an organism's capacity for coping with environmental or ecological variability.

Although these roles have been examined independently in detail in adult fishes, less attention has been paid to the effects of an endogenous stress response during early life, particularly with respect to its potential effects on ionic/osmotic balance. The present study tested the hypothesis that exposure of zebrafish to stress during early development would alter ion balance later in life. Zebrafish at three developmental stages (4, 7, or 15Â days post-fertilization, dpf) were subjected to an air-exposure stressor twice a day for 2Â days, causing elevation of whole-body cortisol levels. Individuals stressed early in life exhibited decreased survival and growth, altered cortisol responses to a subsequent air-exposure stressor, and increased whole-body Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations. Changes in whole-body Ca2+ concentrations were accompanied by increased ionocyte abundance at 7 dpf and increased rates of Ca2+ uptake from the environment. Differences in whole-body ion concentrations at 15 and 35 dpf were not accompanied by altered ion uptake rates. Across all ages examined, air-exposure stress experienced at 7 dpf was particularly effective at eliciting phenotypic changes, suggesting a critical window at this age for a stress response to influence development. These findings demonstrate that early-life stress in zebrafish triggers developmental plasticity, with age-dependent effects on both the cortisol stress axis and ion balance.

A control group was maintained in optimal conditions (C: mean O2: 10.41 mg/L; min: 10.12, max: 10.69 mg/L). At 4 days post-hypoxia, basal (resting) whole body cortisol levels were significantly higher in the H group (166.84 Â± 20.67 ng/g) as compared to the C group (103.71 Â± 8.78 ng/g), but no post-stress differences were evident (values âˆ¼ 175 ng/g). Long-term effects of hypoxia on various behavioural traits were analysed between 3 and 4 months after the return to normoxia and compared to the C group. The exposure of fry to chronic hypoxia did not impact the fish's behavioural repertoire (activity, stereotypic behaviour, aggression) in their home tanks after re-acclimation to normoxia. Moreover, basal and post-stress plasma cortisol levels, fear-related behaviours (novel-tank test), and risk-taking behaviours (emergence test) did not differ between the C and H groups. However, this early challenge resulted in an enhanced post-hypoxic growth rate in these fish. Our results show that early exposure to moderate hypoxia does not induce any behavioural changes in rainbow trout after several months of return to normoxia. Â© 2020 The Author(s)",

We investigated stress effects on lake sturgeon larvae after encounters with common aquatic insect predators by quantifying mortality, body size, cortisol levels, and swimming behavior. Free embryos were exposed to either Perlidae (stonefly obligate predators) or Isonychiidae (mayfly filterers and facultative predators) or to no predators (controls). Free embryos that encountered perlids experienced high mortality, elevated cortisol levels, and exhibited cortisol reactivity when subsequently exposed to an acute stressor. Free embryos that encountered isonychiids exhibited elevated mortality, and elevated cortisol and cortisol reactivity relative to controls. Findings indicate that lake sturgeon free embryos are stressed by exposure to members of benthic stream communities during early life stages (predation of nearby conspecifics), and that metrics of stress exhibited threat sensitivity. Data are consistent with predictions that individuals modulate antipredator behavior in response to the intensity of perceived predation threat in the environment. We determined that behavioral outcomes associated with encounters with aquatic insects altered future behavioral trajectories, potentially as an adaptive response that can affect predation rates in subsequent life stages. Results contribute to a broader understanding of how interspecies interactions among co-occurring predator and prey communities may impact individual fitness and fish population recruitment.

Kankova2022,Effect of blue and red monochromatic light during incubation on the early post-embryonic development of immune responses in broiler chicken,"Kankova, Z. and Drozdova, A. and Hodova, V. and Zeman, M.",British Poultry Science,71668,NA,NA,NA,,,2022,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,,,10.1080/00071668.2022.2042485,"1. The light regime during incubation can influence embryonic and post-embryonic life and its effects can be mediated by rhythmic melatonin production in the embryonic pineal gland. 2. This study explored whether the incubation of chick embryos under red or blue monochromatic light, which induces maximum and minimum melatonin production, respectively, can influence the development and reactivity of the immune system in chicks. 3. In hatchlings, basal expression of immune genes (AvBD-1, PSEN-1, and IL-6) was evaluated in the duodenum using real-time PCR. The expression of these genes was measured weekly for three weeks after hatching, 3Â h after intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. At these times, the heterophil/lymphocyte ratio (He/Ly) was evaluated on blood smears, plasma immunoglobulin Y (IgY) concentrations by ELISA and IL-6 gene expression in the spleen by real-time PCR were determined. 4. During development, the He/Ly ratio and plasma IgY concentration were not significantly influenced by the light quality during incubation. Red light increased gene expression of AvBD-1 in hatchlings and IL-6 in two-week-old chickens compared to birds incubated under blue light. The expression of IL-6 after LPS stimulation increased in an age-dependent manner, both in the duodenum and the spleen, reflecting the maturation of the immune system. 5. The results suggested that red light may increase the local immune response in the gut immediately after hatching, but this effect was not apparent during later development.

In fact, rising global temperatures have already caused widespread extinctions among lizards. Viviparous species might be more susceptible to increasing temperatures because of their inability to meet their energetic demands following rapid environmental changes. Nevertheless, we do not yet fully understand how lizards with different reproductive modes can respond to climate change. We investigated the effect of both maternal thermal environment during pregnancy and incubation temperature on hatchling morphology and physiological performance of two populations of the lizard Saiphos equalis differing in their mode of reproduction, to test whether reproductive mode affects the ability to buffer against rising temperatures. Gravid females from both populations were subjected to current or projected end-of-century (future) thermal environments, to evaluate differences in the body size, growth rate, thermal preference, and locomotor performance of their offspring. Our results show that independently of the mode of reproduction, high temperatures accelerated gestation periods. Thermal environments did not affect hatchling thermal preference, but viviparous hatchlings consistently preferred lower temperatures. Unlike viviparous lizards, oviparous hatchlings incubated under future temperatures were smaller and had a lower growth rate compared to current-incubated hatchlings. Finally, thermal environments did not affect hatchling endurance and speed when controlling for body size. Our results show that global warming is likely to have a negative impact on S. equalis, but suggest that some of its effects may be ameliorated by maternal responses during pregnancy, particularly in viviparous populations.

This study aimed to assess whether prenatal ambient temperature influences the response of Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) chicks to environmental challenges during growth. The experiment was conducted in a 2 Ã— 2 factorial arrangement: two temperature conditions for the mothers (thermoneutral and heat stress by continuous exposure to 32Â Â°C) and two offspring ambient temperature conditions (thermoneutral and heat stress by intermittent exposure to 34Â Â°C for 6Â h/day from 15 to 35Â days of age). Heat stress in mothers led to lower laying rate, egg mass, expression of methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MSRA) gene, and antioxidant capacity as well as higher chick mortality rate (1â€“15Â days of age). Maternal heat stress led to lower weight gain and total antioxidant capacity and higher feed conversion ratio. Maternal temperature Ã— Offspring temperature interaction effects were observed on carbonylated protein content and HSP70, GSS, and MSRA gene expression. It was observed that, for chicks hatched from heat-stressed mothers, exposure to heat stress led to higher carbonylated protein content and HSP70 expression than exposure to thermoneutral conditions. Maternal heat stress was also responsible for increasing GSS expression in chicks grown under thermoneutral conditions. Chicks hatched from non-stressed mothers and subjected to heat stress had higher MSRA expression compared to chicks maintained in a thermoneutral environment. Our results show that, although maternal heat stress had no negative effects on performance or oxidative metabolism of offspring grown under thermoneutral conditions, it was associated with lower performance and higher protein oxidation in offspring exposed to heat stress during growth. These results could be due in part to alterations in the expression of genes related to antioxidant capacity. Â© 2021, The Author(s).",

Genetic differences might also affect the offspring's susceptibility to maternal experiences. In this study, we tested if maternal stress affects measures of stress and fear in five strains of layer breeders: commercial brown 1 & 2, commercial white 1 & 2 and a pure line White Leghorn. Each strain was equally separated into two groups: â€œMaternal Stressâ€ (MS), where hens were subjected to a series of 8 consecutive days of acute psychological stressors, and â€œControl,â€ which received routine husbandry. Additional eggs from Control were injected either with corticosterone diluted in a vehicle solution (â€œCORTâ€) or just â€œVehicle.â€ Stress- and fear-responses of the offspring were measured in a plasma corticosterone test and a combined human approach and novel object test. While the stress treatments did not affect the measured endpoints in the offspring, significant strain differences were found. The offspring of the white strains showed a higher physiological response compared to brown strains and the White 2 offspring was the least fearful strain in the human approach test. Our study found that neither the acute psychological stressors experienced by layer breeders nor the egg injections of corticosterone affected the parameters tested in their offspring. Post hoc power analyses suggest that the lack of treatment effects might be due to a small sample size (type II error). Although studies on larger flocks of layers are still needed, our results provide an initial understanding of an important subject, as in poultry production, layer breeders are often subjected to short-term stressors. In addition, our results suggest the dissociation between the physiological and behavioural parameters of stress response in laying hens, showing that increased concentrations of plasma corticosterone in response to stress might not be directly associated with high levels of fear.

For example, many viviparous lizards are cold adapted which may restrict their activity times during the reproductive season, increasing their susceptibility to global warming. However, it is unclear if and how lizards with different reproductive modes (oviparity vs. viviparity) can respond to rising temperatures by modifying their life-history traits. We examined the effect of developmental temperatures on hatchling behavior and learning in viviparous and oviparous populations of the lizard Saiphos equalis to test whether their reproductive behavior can buffer against rising temperatures. Gravid females from both populations were subjected to current or projected end-of-century (future) thermal environments to evaluate differences in the exploratory, foraging and antipredator behavior, and spatial learning ability of their offspring. We found that viviparous lizards were more exploratory and had a less-pronounced antipredator response than oviparous lizards. Regardless of the mode of reproduction, elevated temperatures reduced the exploratory behavior of hatchling lizards. Elevated temperatures also reduced the foraging efficiency of oviparous, but not viviparous, hatchlings. Finally, future-gestated oviparous hatchlings were more likely to choose the correct refuge and made fewer mistakes in a spatial learning task; however, we found only weak evidence of spatial learning in S. equalis. Our results suggest that although global warming is likely to have a negative impact on phenotypic traits, in S. equalis, some of these effects may be ameliorated by maternal behavior and/or physiological responses during pregnancy, particularly in viviparous populations. Significance statement: Computational modeling studies suggest that live-bearing lizards (viviparous) are more vulnerable to global warming compared with egg-laying ones (oviparous). However, there is little experimental evidence showing that viviparous species are indeed at a greater risk of extinction. Using a lizard species that has both oviparous and viviparous populations, we tested the effect of high developmental temperatures (projected for 2100) on the behavior and learning of their offspring. We found that elevated temperatures had a stronger negative effect on egg-laying lizards by producing hatchlings with lower foraging efficiency. Our results suggest that viviparous mothers can ameliorate some of the effects of global warming on their offspring. Moreover, our study suggests that if live bearers are indeed more vulnerable to global warming, it is likely not due to maladaptive behavior in offspring, but rather, to other causes that affect pregnant females.

During embryonic development, rising temperatures might lead to the overproduction of one sex and, in turn, could bias populationsâ€™ sex ratios to an extent that threatens their persistence. If climate change predictions are correct, and biased sex ratios reduce population viability, species with TSD may go rapidly extinct unless adaptive mechanisms, whether behavioural, physiological or molecular, exist to buffer these temperature-driven effects. Here, we summarize the discovery of the TSD phenomenon and its still elusive evolutionary significance. We then review the molecular pathways underpinning TSD in model species, along with the hormonal mechanisms that interact with temperatures to determine an individual's sex. To illustrate evolutionary mechanisms that can affect sex determination, we focus on sea turtle biology, discussing both the adaptive potential of this threatened TSD taxon, and the risks associated with conservation mismanagement.

There is growing confidence in the international community to abandon the conventional practices of â€œcage-rearing and beak-trimmingâ€ to improve the welfare of chickens. Therefore, in this review, we summarized some of the effective poultry management practices that have provided welfare benefits for pullets. The results are as follows: 1. Maintaining similar housing conditions at different periods alleviates fear and discomfort among pullets; 2. Pullets reared under cage-free systems have better physical conditions and temperaments than those reared in cage systems, and they are more suitable to be transferred to similar housing to lay eggs; 3. Improving flock uniformity in appearance and body size has reduced the risk of pecking and injury; 4. Maintaining an appropriate population (40â€“500 birds) has reduced flock aggressiveness; 5. A combination of 8â€“10 h of darkness and 5â€“30 lux of light-intensity exposure via natural or warm white LED light has achieved a welfareâ€“performance balance in pullets. (This varies by age, strain, and activities.); 6. Dark brooders (mimicking mother hens) have alleviated fear and pecking behaviors in pullets; 7. The air quality of the chicken house has been effectively improved by optimizing feed formulation and ventilation, and by reducing fecal accumulation and fermentation; 8. Complex environments (with litter, perches, straw bales, slopes, platforms, outdoor access, etc.) have stimulated the activities of chickens and have produced good welfare effects. In conclusion, the application of comprehensive management strategies has improved the physical and mental health of pullets, which has, in turn, improved the quantity and quality of poultry products.

Additionally, phenotypic diversity resulting from domestication and selection for productivity has created a variety of poultry lines that may cope with stress differently. In this study, we investigated the effects of maternal stress on the behavior of different strains of laying hens and the role of corticosterone as its mediator. For this, fertilized eggs of five genetic linesâ€”two brown (Brown 1 and 2), two white (White 1 and 2), and one pure line White Leghornâ€”were reared identically as four flocks of 27 birds (24F: 3M) per strain. Each strain was equally separated into two groups: Maternal Stress (â€œMSâ€), where hens were subjected to a series of daily acute psychological stressors for 8 days before egg collection, and â€œControl,â€ which received routine husbandry. Fertile eggs from both treatments were collected at three different ages forming different offspring groups that were treated as replicates; additional eggs from Control were injected either with corticosterone diluted in a vehicle solution (â€œCORTâ€) or just â€œVehicle.â€ Eggs from each replicate were incubated and hatched, and offspring (N = 1,919) were brooded under identical conditions. To measure the effects of maternal stress on anxiety and fear-like behavior, offspring were subjected to a social isolation test (SI) between 5 and 10 days of age and a tonic immobility test (TI) at 9 weeks of age. Compared to Control, MS decreased the number of distress vocalizations emitted by White 2 in SI. No effects of MS were observed in TI, and no effects of CORT were observed in any tests. Overall, brown lines vocalized more in SI and remained in TI for a longer duration than white strains, suggesting genetic differences in fear behavior. Females vocalized more than males in TI and showed a trend toward significance for the same trait in SI. Overall, results suggest that the effects of maternal stress on fearfulness are not directly mediated by corticosterone. Moreover, it highlights behavioral differences across various strains of laying hens, suggesting that fear responses are highly dependent on genotype.

It reduces breeding success but also, it can strongly affect parental investment and reproductive decisions. Here we tested the extent of effects of nest predation on south temperate house wrens Troglodytes aedon bonariae by comparing the nesting success and breeding decisions of pairs breeding in plots that differed in nesting failure rates. During 2007 and 2008 breeding seasons we monitored nests built in nest boxes with a 27 mm entrance hole in a plot (E1) and with a 54 mm entrance hole in another plot (E2). At the end of the 2008 breeding season we reduced entrance holes of nest boxes at E2 to 27 mm. During 2007 and 2008 breeding seasons, nest failures were higher at E2 than E1 (70.6% and 25.8% respectively). Clutch sizes, brood sizes and number of fledgling produced per nest were smaller in E2 than in E1. However, females at E2 laid bigger eggs. Hatching success was lower at E2 than at E1, but fledgling success was similar between sites. Females nesting at E2 performed less frequently a second brood than those at E1. We did not detect differences between sites in individual breeding dispersal, mate change, apparent adult survival and offspring survival and recruitment. As a consequence of a reduced clutch size, higher hatching failures and lower frequency of double broods, individuals nesting at E2 had a lower annual productivity than those at E1. No differences in nest failure frequency and productivity were found between sites during the 2009 and 2010 breeding seasons. Our results provide experimental evidence of the existence of reproductive costs beyond nest loss associated with nesting in areas with high risk of nest predation in house wrens.

GBH residues are detected in soil, water, crops, and food products, potentially exposing non-target organisms to health risks; these organisms include wildlife, livestock, and humans. However, the potential for GBH-related parental effects are poorly understood. In the case of birds, GBHs may be transferred directly from mothers to eggs, or they may indirectly influence offspring performance by altered maternal resource allocation to eggs. We experimentally exposed a parental generation of Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica) to GBHs (200mg/kg feed) or respective controls. Glyphosate residues were found in eggs (ca 0.76kg/mg). Embryonic development tended to be poorer in the eggs of GBH-exposed parents (76\% of eggs showed normal development) compared to control parents (89\% normal eggs). Embryonic brain tissue from GBH-exposed parents tended to express more lipid damage (20\% higher), yet other biomarkers showed no apparent differences. We detected no differences in egg quality (egg, yolk, or shell mass, egg hormone concentration) across the treatment groups. Given this is the first long-term study testing parental effects of GBHs with birds, more studies are needed characterizing GBH-associated changes in maternal allocation and for example epigenetic programming.",

In vertebrates, predation risk activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and there is growing evidence that activation of the maternal HPA axis can have intergenerational consequences via, for example, maternally-derived steroids in eggs. Here, we investigated how predation risk affects a suite of maternally-derived steroids in threespine stickleback eggs across nine Alaskan lakes that vary in whether predatory trout are absent, native, or have been stocked within the last 25 years. Using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS), we detected 20 steroids within unfertilized eggs. Factor analysis suggests that steroids covary within and across steroid classes (i.e. glucocorticoids, progestogens, sex steroids), emphasizing the modularity and interconnectedness of the endocrine response. Surprisingly, egg steroid profiles were not significantly associated with predator regime, although they were more variable when predators were absent compared to when predators were present, with either native or stocked trout. Despite being the most abundant steroid, cortisol was not consistently associated with predation regime. Thus, while predators can affect steroids in adults, including mothers, the link between maternal stress and embryonic development is more complex than a simple one-to-one relationship between the population-level predation risk experienced by mothers and the steroids mothers transfer to their eggs.

In this study, both models were used to investigate the effects of genetic line on hatchability, late embryonic mortality, sex ratio, and body weight until 17 wk of age. To form the parent stock, fertilized eggs of 4 commercial genetic lines â€” two brown (brown 1 and 2), two white (white 1 and 2), and a pure line White Leghorn â€” were incubated, hatched, and housed identically in 4 flocks of 27 birds (24 females and 3 males) per strain. Each strain was equally separated into 2 groups: â€œmaternal stress,â€ where hens were subjected to a series of acute psychological stressors (e.g., physical restraint, transportation) for 8 D before egg collection, and â€œcontrol,â€ where hens received routine husbandry. At 3 maternal ages, fertile eggs from both treatments were collected, and additional eggs from the control group were injected with corticosterone (10 ng/mL egg content) (â€œCORTâ€). A â€œvehicleâ€ treatment was included to account for effects of egg manipulation. Each maternal age comprised a replicate over time. Eggs were incubated and hatched, and the offspring (N = 1,919) were brooded until 17 wk under identical conditions. The results show that prenatal stress interacted with strain to decrease embryonic survival and growth. Among all strains, brown 2 was consistently the most affected line in both prehatch and posthatch development. Our study shows that embryonic survival and offspring growth are mostly affected by the pharmacological model and that strain differences may increase susceptibility to prenatal stress. Moreover, it suggests that the natural stressor model may be useful for quantifying the response of the mother to stressors, whereas the pharmacological model may be useful for quantifying the response of the embryo to increased levels of corticosterone.

We injected zebra finch eggs with testosterone (T), monitored postnatal growth, and analyzed markers of oxidative damage in heart and liver in mature birds. We measured 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine and isoprostanes, markers of oxidative damage to DNA and membrane lipids, respectively. T treatment (1) reduced growth rates of female but not male nestlings vs. controls; (2) resulted in less accumulation of 8-oxo-dG, but not IsoPs, in liver tissue of 60-day-old females, but not males; and (3) a trend toward elevated 8-oxo-dG levels in heart tissue of males and females at 60 and 180Â days old combined. These results generally support the testosterone oxidative damage hypothesis, in that embryonic exposure to higher T resulted in damage to DNA of heart tissue in both sexes. They also suggest that sex-specific effects of androgens on early growth rates may carry over as differences in some forms of oxidative damage in adults. This supports a basic tenet of evolutionary aging theory that developmental influences early in life can be linked to costs later on.

However, the utilization of enrichment in aquaculture is still infrequent, maybe because there is a paucity of knowledge about how its effects depend on factors such as fish species, developmental stage, social environment or the type and extent of enrichment. In this study, we evaluated the effects of physical enrichment on the welfare of rainbow trout juveniles, by exposing them to simple plastic screen shelters. Juveniles of approx. 15 g were introduced to two types of submerged shelters: full screens (Full) or partial screens (Semi), and fish welfare was assessed and compared to a control group (without shelters) by evaluating fish growth and condition, extent of external lesions, and the neuroendocrine responses to acute and repeated stress. During the eleven-week experimental period, the fish in the sheltered units gradually developed a clear shelter-seeking behavior when exposed to external disturbance. Fish growth, condition factor and mortality were not affected by shelter presence. The presence of full shelters had a modest protective effect on fin damage: both pectoral fin- and total fin damage scores were reduced (> 10%) in this group with respect to the control group; the percentage of fish with severe damage in the pectoral fin was reduced in the Full group with respect to the Control (63% vs 82%). Partial shelters had no significant effect on fin damage scores, when compared to the control group. The presence of shelters did not affect the general level of stress upon standardized acute or repeated stressors. However, fish used to the presence of shelters showed a more intense startling response when exposed to stressors that forced them to abandon the shelter protection. Altogether, this study shows potential for shelters to be used as a welfare-promoting strategy in trout farming, but further research is needed to optimize the shelter type and design and the proper timing for its application.

Under our experimental conditions, we recommend that the stocking density of laying ducks should be kept to 4 or fewer birds/m2 to avoid the negative effects of high stocking density on performance and egg quality of laying ducks.

Hedlund2022,"Effects of stress during commercial hatching on growth, egg production and feather pecking in laying hens","Hedlund, L. and Jensen, P.",PLoS ONE,19326203,17,1 Januray,NA,,,2022,Public Library of Science,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0262307,"Every year, billions of egg layer chicks around the world are hatched under highly stressful, industrial circumstances. Here, it is investigated how the stressful procedure in the commercial hatchery, including incubation, hatching, processing, and transport affects the chicks with regards to traits relevant for the egg production industry. These traits were compared to those of a control group hatched in a small incubator and handled gently och quietly in a quiet room without any processing and transport. The chicks were weighed at hatch and at eight additional time points: 4 days, 1 week (w), 2 w, 3 w, 5 w, 8 w, 20 w and 25 w of age. Feather pecking was studied at 15 w of age and damages to the feathers and injuries on the comb and wattle were assessed at 25 w of age. From 19 w of age, eggs were collected on three days per week, counted and weighed. Chicks from a commercial hatchery had a lower hatch weight than control chicks (p<0.001). At 20 w of age, the weight of the commercial hatched chicks was still numerically lower, although this did not reach statistical significance. Commercially hatched chicks tended to show more feather pecking behaviour at 15 w of age compared to control chicks (p<0.1), although feather condition at 25 w of age showed the opposite pattern. Regarding production, commercially hatched chickens laid fewer (p<0.05) and smaller (p<0.05) eggs than chicks hatched and handled under calm circumstances. From this experiment, it is concluded that the stressful experience in the commercial hatchery has an overall negative effect on traits relevant for the industry. Copyright: Â© 2022 Hedlund, Jensen.

Various kinds of stress and their impact on the biological system have been investigated for many years. This â€œstress responseâ€ is a highly interactive phenomenon, which involves complex relationships between the HPA axis and other neuroendocrine systems that affect several aspects of social behavior. Stressful experiences in early gestation are better predictors of adverse outcomes than the same measures assessed later in gestation. It is now clear that varieties of stressful conditions during pregnancy can have long-lasting effects on fetal development with respect to emotional, behavioral, immune, and cognitive outcomes. The stress has the potential for â€˜social programmingâ€™ by differentially influencing reproductive behavior and fetal development. The role of epigenetic changes in mediating alterations in offspring outcome following prenatal stress is likely to be important and starting to be explored. The chapter provides a framework from which novel investigations could work to understand the significance of exposure to stress during early life and its impact on later health, fitness, and social behaviors. The understanding may lead to devise strategies for positive effects on fitness following early life stress. Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

These may be cooperative or competitive, and shape the dynamics of social systems, with profound effects on individual behavior, physiology, fitness, and health. On one hand, a wealth of studies on humans, laboratory animal models, and captive species have focused on understanding the relationships between social interactions and individual health within the context of disease and pathology. On the other, ecological studies are attempting an understanding of how social interactions shape individual phenotypes in the wild, and the consequences this entails in terms of adaptation. Whereas numerous studies in wild vertebrates have focused on the relationships between social environments and the stress axis, much remains to be done in understanding how socially-related activation of the stress axis coordinates other key physiological functions related to health. Here, we review the state of our current knowledge on the effects that social interactions may have on other markers of vertebrate fitness and health. Building upon complementary findings from the biomedical and ecological fields, we identify 6 key physiological functions (cellular metabolism, oxidative stress, cellular senescence, immunity, brain function, and the regulation of biological rhythms) which are intimately related to the stress axis, and likely directly affected by social interactions. Our goal is a holistic understanding of how social environments affect vertebrate fitness and health in the wild. Whereas both social interactions and social environments are recognized as important sources of phenotypic variation, their consequences on vertebrate fitness, and the adaptive nature of social-stress-induced phenotypes, remain unclear. Social flexibility, or the ability of an animal to change its social behavior with resulting changes in social systems in response to fluctuating environments, has emerged as a critical underlying factor that may buffer the beneficial and detrimental effects of social environments on vertebrate fitness and health.

However, recent evidence indicates that maternal GCs may adaptively programme particular physiological and molecular pathways during development to enhance offspring fitness. In this context, an important mechanism through which maternal GCs may lastingly affect offspring phenotypic quality and survival is via effects on embryo telomerase activity and so on offspring postnatal telomere length. Here, using a field experimental design for which we manipulated the corticosterone content in yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) eggs, we show that embryos from corticosterone-injected eggs not only had a higher telomerase activity but also longer telomeres just after hatching. A complementary analysis further revealed that gull hatchlings with longer telomeres had a higher survival probability during the period when most of the chick mortality occurs. Given the important role that telomere length and its restoring mechanisms have on ageing trajectories and disease risk, our findings provide a new mechanistic link by which mothers may presumably shape offspring life-history trajectories and phenotype.

The negative relationship between egg thiamine and lipid concentration to post-hatch larval growth and survival in teleost species, coupled with the limited research of egg thiamine in Acipenseriform species of conservation concern, including lake sturgeon, indicates that study of thiamine concentrations lake sturgeon eggs is warranted. Eggs were collected from females (NÂ =Â 12) during the early and late portion of the spawning run in 2007 in a wild population from Black Lake, MI. Concentrations of thiamine, lipid and fatty acid concentration were measured along with female biological information (body size and egg size) and characteristics of larvae at hatch. Significant differences in egg thiamine concentrations were observed between early- and late-spawning females (meanÂ Â±Â SD: 2.36Â nmolÂ·gâˆ’1Â Â±Â 1.09 vs. 0.73Â Â±Â 0.25Â nmolÂ·gâˆ’1, WÂ =Â 0.05, pÂ &lt;.01). No significant relationships were observed between female body size or egg size and egg lipid or thiamine concentration. Differences in lipid and thiamine concentrations were not predictive of larval body size or yolk sac volume at hatch. Total and phosphorylated thiamine were correlated with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, suggesting that dietary items were likely partially responsible for provisioning of essential compounds. Given the negative effects of low egg thiamine concentration on larval survival in other fish species globally, results indicate that further research in areas of nutrient acquisition and thiamine effects on larval survival, natural recruitment, and hatchery feeding strategies is warranted for lake sturgeon.

Sex allocation can be adjusted by controlling offspring sex ratio or by sex-specific resource allocation towards individual eggs. The latter is well-known in birds and reptiles, but less studied in other organisms, especially haplodiploids with females that can adjust offspring sex via fertilization control. Here, we investigated whether egg size can affect sex allocation in a haplodiploid thrips, Pezothrips kellyanus. First, we established that larger eggs are more likely to be fertilized and become females than smaller eggs, which remain unfertilized and become males. This size-dependent fertilization may be regulated by anatomical constraints that allow sperm access only to larger eggs. Furthermore, across both sexes, larger eggs developed into offspring with higher fitness, suggesting that egg size is a reliable proxy for resource allocation in this species. During the early phase of reproduction, mating increased investment by females towards egg size thereby facilitating fertilization success and increased female offspring survival. However, this came with a reduced lifetime fecundity, reflecting that mating manipulates reproductive strategies in favour of increased daughter production. This may be in conflict with the optimal offspring sex ratio of females which is theoretically less female-biased than for males. We detected both egg size-mediated sex allocation and a mating effect on resource allocation under both laboratory and field conditions, suggesting that they are maintained by natural selection. We provide evidence for a finely tuned egg size-dependent fertilization mechanism that mediates sex allocation strategies and is moderated by mating. Furthermore, our findings establish a new perspective about potential effects of sexual conflicts on egg size and sex allocation.

Birds lay one egg per day and in hot climates, the first laid eggs may start to develop before the laying of the rest of the clutch is complete, through warming by the ambient air temperature. Here, we test the hypothesis that in hot conditions, skews in egg size across the laying sequence may be more pronounced, as females use egg size to compensate for hatching asynchrony, providing a higher level of provisioning to the later laid eggs that would hatch later due to ambient incubation. We have focused on the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata, a species that typically breeds over an extended period of the year, and therefore across a particularly wide range of ambient temperatures. We characterised the variation in egg size using data from over 700 clutches, including historical specimens, a wild population, and both domesticated and wild birds breeding in captivity, in addition to clutches produced experimentally in controlled-temperature rooms. Here, we document significant variation in egg size between and within clutches, with eggs increasing in size over the laying order, with both maternal identity and population differences playing an important role (domesticated birds laid eggs that were much larger than their wild counterparts). However, we found no support for the idea that variation in egg size either within a clutch, and across clutches and populations, is related to variation in ambient temperature, despite the large range of thermal environments experienced during laying. In conclusion, whilst egg size is clearly a labile characteristic there is no evidence this is flexibly adjusted to local ambient temperatures before and during laying. Â© 2019 Nordic Society Oikos.

Support for such an intermediate optimum in MHC allele count has mainly been demonstrated in studies on parasite load and reproductive traits. In this study we tested if an intermediate number of MHC class II (MHCII) alleles based on positively selected sites was correlated with an increased skin-swelling response to two consecutive injections of phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) in bluethroat Luscinia svecica nestlings. We found that nestlings that were closer to the population mean in their number of alleles had a higher response to the first injection, supporting an intermediate, optimal number of alleles. After the second PHA injection, we found that the skin swelling was associated with MHCII allele count only at the among-brood level, and with paternity (extra-pair offspring had a larger swelling than within-pair offspring). We therefore conclude that the PHA response is partly correlated with MHCII allele count, but that additional factors must be involved in both the PHA response and in female extra-pair mate choice in this species.

Avian brood parasites exhibit feats of strength in early life as adaptations to exploit the hosts that rear them. We hypothesized that an increase in embryonic movement could allow brood parasites to develop the required musculature for these demands. We measured embryo movement across incubation for multiple brood-parasitic and non-parasitic bird species. Using a phylogenetically controlled analysis, we found that brood parasites exhibited significantly increased muscular movement during incubation compared to non-parasites. This suggests that increased embryo movement may facilitate the development of the stronger musculoskeletal system required for the demanding tasks undertaken by young brood parasites.

Endothermy is acquired and regulated via various endocrine and molecular pathways, and ultimately allows wide aerial, aquatic, and terrestrial distribution in variable environments. However, due to our changing climate, birds are faced with potential new challenges for thermoregulation, such as more frequent extreme weather events, lower predictability of climate, and increasing mean temperature. We provide an overview on thermoregulation in birds and its endocrine and molecular mechanisms, pinpointing gaps in current knowledge and recent developments, focusing especially on non-model species to understand the generality of, and variation in, mechanisms. We highlight plasticity of thermoregulation and underlying endocrine regulation, because thorough understanding of plasticity is key to predicting responses to changing environmental conditions. To this end, we discuss how changing climate is likely to affect avian thermoregulation and associated endocrine traits, and how the interplay between these physiological processes may play a role in facilitating or constraining adaptation to a changing climate. We conclude that while the general patterns of endocrine regulation of thermogenesis are quite well understood, at least in poultry, the molecular and endocrine mechanisms that regulate, e.g. mitochondrial function and plasticity of thermoregulation over different time scales (from transgenerational to daily variation), need to be unveiled. Plasticity may ameliorate climate change effects on thermoregulation to some extent, but the increased frequency of extreme weather events, and associated changes in resource availability, may be beyond the scope and/or speed for plastic responses. This could lead to selection for more tolerant phenotypes, if the underlying physiological traits harbour genetic and individual variation for selection to act on â€“ a key question for future research.

However, studies examining the ontogeny of the cortisol endocrine axis in acipenseriformes (sturgeon and paddlefish) have demonstrated similar general patterns during early development. Beginning with maternal deposition of cortisol in the egg, followed by development of de novo synthesis, a hypo-responsive period, and finally the ability of the fish to appropriately increase whole-body levels of cortisol in response to a stressor. In the present study, we demonstrate a similar pattern of ontogeny in the cortisol response in lake sturgeon over two-year classes. Whole-body levels of cortisol were examined over two cohorts and found to be different in both concentration and timing of endogenous production. The 2016 cohort were found to have relatively high levels of cortisol and developed to first feeding approximately six days faster than the 2017 cohort with lower levels of cortisol. In the 2017 cohort, mRNA expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and glucocorticoid receptor 1 (GR1) increased just prior to the increase in cortisol and associated onset of exogenous feeding. Treatment in metyrapone, an inhibitor of 11Î²-hydroxylase, significantly inhibited cortisol production and resulted in the inability of the fish to appropriately transition to exogenous feeding. Data suggest a potential key role for cortisol in lake sturgeon as they transition between diets during early life history. Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.",

In birds and rodents, this process is largely driven by estrogens during a critical period. In rodents, estrogens drive the masculinization of the brain, a process that partly depends on microglia. In contrast, in birds, estrogens produced by females induce demasculinization, but whether microglia are involved in this process is unknown. This study assessed whether microglial number, morphology, and/or activity differ between the sexes in selected regions of the developing quail brain and whether they are influenced by estrogens. We found a robust female-biased sex difference in microglial numbers between embryonic day 9 and 12 in the medial preoptic nucleus (POM), a key region for the expression of male sexual behavior. This difference relies on estrogens produced during the sensitive period. Although most embryonic microglia express iNOS, the expression of iNOS in individual microglia does not differ between sexes. Finally, microglial number and the expression of iNOS were not affected by the microglia inhibitor minocycline. Together, these results revealed an estrogen-dependent sex difference in microglia during the critical period for the sexual differentiation of the quail brain. This difference mirrors the different role of estrogens in the development of birds and rodents and suggests a role for microglia in the sexual differentiation of the brain of birds, as in rodents, thus supporting the hypothesis of a conserved role of the neuroimmune system in the organization of the brain by estrogens.

The adaptive nature of female ornaments is now widely accepted. After a rapid overview of this shift, we present the results of comparative studies focused on identifying the forces involved in the evolution of female coloration in birds. We then discuss the results of intraspecific ornithological field studies and finish up by summarizing the work done by our group and others on female coloration in blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus). Overall, this review confirms that female coloration traits function as ornaments and/or badges of status in many bird species. It also identifies several mechanisms that can circumvent trade-offs in investment between coloration traits and egg production. Based on this review, we call for further research on certain topics and specific changes in practices. More precisely, at the macroevolutionary level, we should avoid framing our questions around sexual dichromatism and male-centered proxies of sexual selection if we wish to elucidate the female-specific selective forces and constraints involved in the evolution of female coloration. At the microevolutionary level, we need to quantify social and sexual selection in both sexes, and to perform experimental studies to compare the selective forces acting on female and male coloration. In particular, it appears important to investigate how maternal effects and physiological drivers of aggressiveness relate to female coloration. Finally, our work on blue tits illustrates the importance of conducting long-term studies in tandem with replicated experiments within a given species. Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.",

One intriguing example is in avian obligate brood parasites; species exhibiting high circulating prolactin but no parental care. To understand this disconnect, we examined transcriptional and behavioral responses to prolactin in brown-headed (Molothrus ater) and bronzed (M aeneus) brood parasitic cowbirds. We first examine prolactin-dependent regulation of transcriptome wide gene expression in the preoptic area (POA), a brain region associated with parental care across vertebrates. We next examined prolactin-dependent abundance of seven parental care-related candidate genes in hypothalamic regions that are prolactin-responsive in other avian species. We found no evidence of prolactin sensitivity in cowbirds in either case. To understand this prolactin insensitivity, we compared prolactin receptor transcript abundance between parasitic and nonparasitic species and between prolactin treated and untreated cowbirds. We observed significantly lower prolactin receptor transcript abundance in brown-headed but not bronzed cowbird POA compared with a nonparasite and no prolactin-dependent changes in either parasitic species. Finally, estrogen-primed female brown-headed cowbirds with or without prolactin treatment exhibited significantly greater avoidance of nestling begging stimuli compared with untreated birds. Taken together, our results suggest that modified prolactin receptor distributions in the POA and surrounding hypothalamic regions disconnect prolactin from parental care in brood parasitic cowbirds.

As metabolic hormones whose production can be influenced by nutritional, physical, or psychosocial stressors, GCs are a valuable (though singular) measure that may reflect the degree of â€œstressâ€ experienced by an individual. Most work to date has focused on how social rank influences GCs in group-living species or how predation risk influences GCs in prey. This work has been revealing, but a more comprehensive assessment of the social environment is needed to fully understand how different features of the social environment influence GCs in both group living and non-group living species and across life history stages. Just as there can be intense within-group competition among adult conspecifics, it bears appreciating there can also be competition among siblings from the same brood, among adult conspecifics that do not live in groups, or among heterospecifics. In these situations, dominance hierarchies typically emerge, albeit, do dominants or subordinate individuals or species have higher GCs? We examine the degree of support for hypotheses derived from group-living species about whether differential GCs between dominants and subordinates reflect the â€œstress of subordinationâ€ or â€œcosts of dominanceâ€ in these other social contexts. By doing so, we aim to test the generality of these two hypotheses and propose new research directions to broaden the lens that focuses on social hierarchies and GCs. Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc. ",

Transgenerational plasticityâ€”when parental exposure to environmental stress leads to changes in offspring phenotypeâ€”has been highlighted as a potential mechanism to respond to various environmental and anthropogenic changes across taxa. Transgenerational effects may be mediated via multiple mechanisms, such as transfer of maternal hormones to eggs/foetus. However, sources of variation in hormone transfer are poorly understood in fish, and thus the first step is to characterise whether environmental challenges alter transfer of maternal hormones to eggs. To this end, we explored the population variation and environmental variation (in response to temperature and endocrine disrupting copper) in maternal thyroid hormone (TH), transfer to offspring in a common fish model species, the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) using multiple approaches: (i) We compared ovarian TH levels among six populations across a wide geographical range in the Baltic Sea, including two populations at high water temperature areas (discharge water areas of nuclear power plants) and we experimentally exposed fish to (ii) environmentally relevant heat stress and (iii) copper for 7 days. We found that populations did not differ in intraovarian TH levels, and short-term heat stress did not influence intraovarian TH levels. However, copper exposure increased both T4 and T3 levels in ovaries. The next step would be to evaluate if such alterations would lead to changes in offspring phenotype. Â© 2020, The Author(s). ",

Corticosterone (CORT), the principal avian glucocorticoid produced in response to stress, is recognised as a potential mediator of such maternal reproductive effects. Maternally-derived yolk CORT is implicated in mediating offspring growth and hatchling begging behaviour. However, determining the potential for maternal effects in opportunistic breeders subject to variable environments relies on understanding whether natural variation in maternal circulating hormones may directly impact the embryo during development. Therefore, we tested whether elevated maternal CORT concentrations increase yolk CORT concentrations in zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) eggs. We remotely dosed breeding females with biologically-relevant doses of CORT, or the oil vehicle, 0-3 h prior to the predicted time of ovulation, and allowed pairs to produce two clutches, one under each treatment, in a crosswise, balanced design. CORT dosing elevated maternal plasma CORT and increased mean yolk CORT by a factor of 1.75 compared to the egg yolks of control mothers. Importantly, CORT concentrations did not differ between inner and outer layers of yolk. We found no egg lay order effect and maternal CORT dosing did not influence reproductive outputs (clutch initiation date, clutch size or egg mass).

This pattern may arise because the pigment responsible for eggshell colouration (biliverdin) may be a costly and limited resource, whose availability is linked to female health state. Thus, it can be predicted that females whose condition is compromised should be constrained in their capacity to deposit biliverdin in the eggshell, thus producing paler clutches. To test this hypothesis, we performed a handicapping experiment by clipping some feathers of female spotless starlings before egg laying and measuring the colour of their clutches. We expected the handicapping treatment to increase flying costs, impairing female overall condition and resulting in paler clutches. Our experiment was successful in lowering the weight gain of handicapped with respect to control females. However, in contrast to our expectations, we found no effect of the treatment on eggshell colouration. Eggshell colour varied along the laying order, with initial eggs of the laying sequence being relatively paler than the rest of the clutch, but this pattern was not different between experimental groups. Despite a very similar methodology, our results differ from a previous study on the same species and offer no support to the post mating sexual selected hypothesis, questioning the general applicability of the sexual selection role of eggshell coloration.

Hormone-mediated maternal effects in egg-laying species are a frequently used model to study such effects, mostly to test whether these increase maternal fitness. However, experimental evidence is inconsistent. This has led researchers to divert to other topics. In this review, we argue that from a Darwinian perspective one should however expect strong interactions between effects of maternal hormones with contextual cues, including environmental factors, embryonic modulation of maternal signals, offspring age and sex, and fathersâ€™ influence. Taking these into account may explain the inconsistencies and new experiments should reveal how the benefits and costs of maternal hormones and prenatal maternal effects in general play out in different contexts.

While chirality on either molecular or organism level has been well established, that on the cellular level has remained an open question for a long time. Although it remains unclear whether chirality exists universally on the cellular level, valuable efforts have recently been made to explore this fundamental topic pertinent to both cell biology and biomaterial science. The development of material fabrication techniques, surface patterning, in particular, has afforded a unique platform to study cell-material interactions. By using patterning techniques, chirality on the cellular level has been examined for cell clusters and single cells in vitro in well-designed experiments. In this review, we first introduce typical fabrication techniques of surface patterning suitable for cell studies and then summarize the main aspects of preliminary evidence of cell chirality on patterned surfaces to date. We finally indicate the limitations of the studies conducted thus far and describe the perspectives of future research in this challenging field. Statement of significance: While both biomacromolecules and organisms can exhibit chirality, it is not yet conclusive whether a cell has left-right (LR) asymmetry. It is important yet challenging to study and reveal the possible existence of cell chirality. By using the technique of surface patterning, the recent decade has witnessed progress in the exploration of possible cell chirality within cell clusters and single cells. Herein, some important preliminary evidence of cell chirality is collected and analyzed. The open questions and perspectives are also described to promote further investigations of cell chirality in biomaterials. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd",

The impacts of environmental stress can be translated across generations through maternally derived glucocorticoids, leading to altered offspring phenotypes. Although these maternal stress effects are often considered negative, recent studies suggest this maternal stress signal may prepare offspring for a similarly stressful environment (environmental match). We applied the environmental match hypothesis to examine whether a prenatal stress signal can dampen the effects of elevated water temperatures on body size, condition, and survival during early development in Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha from Lake Ontario, Canada. We exposed fertilized eggs to prenatal exogenous egg cortisol (1,000Â ng/ml cortisol or 0Â ng/ml control) and then reared these dosed groups at temperatures indicative of current (+0Â°C) and future (+3Â°C) temperature conditions. Offspring reared in elevated temperatures were smaller and had a lower survival at the hatchling developmental stage. Overall, we found that our exogenous cortisol dose did not dampen effects of elevated rearing temperatures (environmental match) on body size or early survival. Instead, our eyed stage survival indicates that our prenatal cortisol dose may be detrimental, as cortisol-dosed offspring raised in elevated temperatures had lower survival than cortisol-dosed and control reared in current temperatures. Our results suggest that a maternal stress signal may not be able to ameliorate the effects of thermal stress during early development. However, we highlight the importance of interpreting the fitness impacts of maternal stress within an environmentally relevant context. Â© 2020 The Authors.

American coot babies are among the most ornamented offspring found in nature, sporting vividly orange-red natal plumage, a bright red beak, and other red parts around the face and pate. Previous plumage manipulation experiments showed that ornamented plumage is favored by strong parental choice for chicks with more extreme ornamentation but left unresolved the question as to why parents show the preference. Here we explore natural patterns of variation in coot chick plumage color, both within and between families, to understand the context of parental preference and to determine whose fitness interests are served by the ornamentation. Conspecific brood parasitism is common in coots and brood parasitic chicks could manipulate hosts by tapping into parental choice for ornamented chicks. However, counter to expectation, parasitic chicks were duller (less red) than nonparasitic chicks. This pattern is explained by color variation within families: Chick coloration increases with position in the egg-laying order, but parasitic eggs are usually the first eggs a female lays. Maternal effects influence chick coloration, but coot females do not use this mechanism to benefit the chicks they lay as parasites. However, within families, chick coloration predicts whether chicks become ""favorites"" when parents begin control over food distribution, implicating a role for the chick ornamentation in the parental lifehistory strategy, perhaps as a reliable signal of a chick's size or age.

In insects, there is also evidence that females deposit juvenile hormones (JH) and ecdysteroids (ESH) in their eggs, hormones that play a key role in regulating offspring growth and metamorphosis. However, it is unclear whether females adjust their hormonal deposition in eggs in response to prenatal environmental conditions. Here we address this gap by conducting an experiment on the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides, in which we manipulated the presence of the male parent and the size of the carcass used for breeding at the time of laying. We also tested for effects of the condition (i.e., body mass) of the parents. We then recorded subsequent effects on JH and ESH concentrations in the eggs. We found no evidence for an effect of these prenatal environmental conditions (male presence and carcass size) on hormonal concentration in the eggs. However, we found that females reduced their deposition of JH when mated with heavier males. This finding is consistent with negative differential allocation of maternal hormones in response to variation in the body mass of the male parent. We encourage further work to investigate the role of maternally derived hormones in insect eggs. Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc. ",

Concerning the female gamete, A. lixula eggs are much darker than those of P. lividus due to the characteristic pigmentation. Upon insemination, the fertilization envelope formed by A. lixula eggs is remarkably thinner than that of P. livius eggs, which implies that the cortical organization of the eggs in the two species may be quite different. In this communication, we examined the phenotypic plasticity of A. lixula eggs in the changing osmolality. The plasma membrane, cortical actin cytoskeleton and vesicles are extensively altered in the eggs exposed to 40% seawater for 15 min. When fertilized, the Ca2+ response in these eggs was significantly compromised and the sperm often failed to enter the eggs. Remarkably, the pattern of the Ca2+ response was restored when these eggs were transferring back to the natural seawater before fertilization, while the actin cytoskeleton partially reverted to the original state. Nonetheless, these eggs restored in seawater failed to regain the innate sperm receptivity that allows only one sperm to enter in natural seawater. Thus, the ability to guide monospermic fertilization is lost by water entry into the eggs, and the eggs incorporated either multiple or no sperm. On the other hand, eggs briefly exposed to hypertonic seawater exhibited no evident morphological anomaly. Nonetheless, the monospermic eggs that experienced a brief exposure (15 min) to hypertonic seawater prior to fertilization in natural seawater displayed a subtly altered sperm-induced Ca2+ response and morpho-functional anomaly around the pluteus stage. Our results suggest that A. lixula eggs attain only a limited extent of cytological plasticity, and that the osmolality shock affects the physical nature of the egg surface which in turn affects the developmental programming.

More specifically, we aim at finding population groups with the best performance in larviculture through an integrative approach that allows considering geographic differentiation in domestication processes. A multi-function/trait assessment was performed on three genetically differentiated groups of European perch populations: (i) Danube, (ii) Eastern Europe, and (iii) European Plain. A geographic differentiation was highlighted for six important traits for perch larviculture: survival rate, swim bladder inflation rate, deformity rate, length at hatching, mean of interindividual distances, and change in activity following a stress event. Along with fish farmer-advice-based weighting of the traits, the calculation of an aquaculture potential score allowed identifying the populations from the Danube region as the most interesting to potentially overcome current bottlenecks in European perch larviculture.

Furthermore, ornaments expressed in females may have indirect fitness effects in offspring via the prenatal physiology associated with, and social consequences of, these signaling traits. Here we examine the influence of prenatal maternal physiology and phenotype on condition-dependent signals of their offspring in adulthood. Specifically, we explore how prenatal maternal testosterone, corticosterone, and ornament color and size correlate with female and male offspring survival to adulthood and ornament quality in the lizard Sceloporus undulatus. Offspring of females with more saturated badges and high prenatal corticosterone were less likely to survive to maturity. Badge saturation and area were negatively correlated between mothers and their male offspring, and uncorrelated to those in female offspring. Maternal prenatal corticosterone was correlated negatively with badge saturation of male offspring in adulthood. Our results indicate that maternal ornamentation and prenatal concentrations of a stress-relevant hormone can lead to compounding fitness costs by reducing offspring survival to maturity and impairing expression of a signal of quality in surviving males. This mechanism may occur in concert with social costs of ornamentation in mothers. Intergenerational effects of female ornamentation and prenatal stress may be interdependent drivers of balancing selection and intralocus sexual conflict over signaling traits.

Most sex chromosomes increase in size but no comprehensive analysis of the kind of sequences that drive this expansion has been presented. Here we analyse sex chromosome structure in common sorrel (Rumex acetosa), a dioecious plant with XY1Y2 sex determination, and we provide the first chromosome-specific repeatome analysis for a plant species possessing sex chromosomes. Methods: We flow-sorted and separately sequenced sex chromosomes and autosomes in R. acetosa using the two-dimensional fluorescence in situ hybridization in suspension (FISHIS) method and Illumina sequencing. We identified and quantified individual repeats using RepeatExplorer, Tandem Repeat Finder and the Tandem Repeats Analysis Program. We employed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to analyse the chromosomal localization of satellites and transposons. Key Results: We identified a number of novel satellites, which have, in a fashion similar to previously known satellites, significantly expanded on the Y chromosome but not as much on the X or on autosomes. Additionally, the size increase of Y chromosomes is caused by non-long terminal repeat (LTR) and LTR retrotransposons, while only the latter contribute to the enlargement of the X chromosome. However, the X chromosome is populated by different LTR retrotransposon lineages than those on Y chromosomes. Conclusions: The X and Y chromosomes have significantly diverged in terms of repeat composition. The lack of recombination probably contributed to the expansion of diverse satellites and microsatellites and faster fixation of newly inserted transposable elements (TEs) on the Y chromosomes. In addition, the X and Y chromosomes, despite similar total counts of TEs, differ significantly in the representation of individual TE lineages, which indicates that transposons proliferate preferentially in either the paternal or the maternal lineage.

Little is known about the genetic basis of variation in TL in wild animal populations, but to understand the evolutionary and ecological significance of TL it is important to quantify the relative importance of genetic and environmental variation in TL. In this study, we measured TL in 2746Â house sparrow nestlings sampled across 20Â years and used an animal model to show that there is a small heritable component of early-life TL (h2Â =Â 0.04). Variation in TL among individuals was mainly driven by environmental (annual) variance, but also brood and parental effects. Parent-offspring regressions showed a large maternal inheritance component in TL ((Formula presented.) =Â 0.44), but no paternal inheritance. We did not find evidence for a negative genetic correlation underlying the observed negative phenotypic correlation between TL and structural body size. Thus, TL may evolve independently of body size and the negative phenotypic correlation is likely to be caused by nongenetic environmental effects. We further used genome-wide association analysis to identify genomic regions associated with TL variation. We identified several putative genes underlying TL variation; these have been inferred to be involved in oxidative stress, cellular growth, skeletal development, cell differentiation and tumorigenesis in other species. Together, our results show that TL has a low heritability and is a polygenic trait strongly affected by environmental conditions in a free-living bird. Â© 2021 The Authors.

Therefore, glucocorticoids are considered to mediate trade-offs between survival and reproduction. Relatively little is known about how selection has shaped glucocorticoid levels. We used 15Â years of captureâ€“recapture and dead recovery data combined with 13Â years of corticosterone and breeding success data taken on breeding barn owls (Tyto alba) to investigate such trade-offs. We found that survival was positively correlated with stress-induced corticosterone levels in both sexes, whereas annual and lifetime reproductive success (i.e. the sum of young successfully fledged during the entire reproductive career) was positively correlated with both baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels in females only. Our results suggest that, in the barn owl, the stress-induced corticosterone response is a good proxy for adult survival and lifetime reproductive success. However, selection pressure appears to act differently on corticosterone levels of males and females. Â© 2020 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

For species showing sexual size dimorphism, the sex of siblings is expected to affect the growth of nestlings through differences in competitive hierarchies mediated by an asymmetry in body size. This study describes growth curves of Ryukyu Scops Owl Otus elegans nestlings, based on the analysis of body mass, wing length and tarsus length in 99 individuals. We subsequently tested for effects of sex of the nestlings, having an older male sibling, hatching order and brood size on the growth curves. Overall, we detected significant effects of several predictor variables, although differences between groups were often small. Males and later hatched chicks had lower body mass throughout their growth. The smaller the brood, the heavier the chicks were on days 0-1 and 30-32, although this relationship was reversed on days 8-13. Males and later hatched chicks also had shorter wings. Males had shorter tarsi than females from day 0 to day 4, however, dimorphism in this trait was reversed afterwards. Chicks in a large brood had longer tarsi. Earlier hatched chicks had longer tarsi in the first half of the growth period, but some of this difference had disappeared by the second half. From day 0 to day 3, individuals with an older brother had longer tarsi than those with an older sister. However, halfway through the growth period and thereafter, individuals with an older brother had shorter tarsi than those with an older sister. The fact that older brothers had an effect on the tarsus growth of their siblings was not due to sexual body size asymmetry, as in fact males were smaller than females in wing length and body size. We suggest that sexual differences in aggression mediated by androgens may have played a role. Â© 2021 Nederlandse Ornithologische Unie. All rights reserved.",

Thus, it has been hypothesized that a healthy microbiome protects telomeres and genomic integrity against cellular stress. However, the link between the early acquired microbiome and telomere dynamics has not hitherto been investigated. In birds, this link may also be potentially modulated by the transfer of maternal glucocorticoids, since these substances dysregulate microbiome composition during postnatal development. Here, we examined the effect of the interplay between the microbiome and stress hormones on the telomere length of yellow-legged gull hatchlings by using a field experiment in which we manipulated the corticosterone content in eggs. We found that the hatchling telomere length was related to microbiome composition, but this relationship was not affected by the corticosterone treatment. Hatchlings with a microbiome dominated by potential commensal bacteria (i.e. Catellicoccus and Cetobacterium) had larger telomeres, suggesting that an early establishment of the species-specific microbiome during development may have important consequences on offspring health and survival.

Hormones mediate developmental plasticity, the changes in the phenotype that occur during ontogeny. Despite their highly conserved functions, the flexibilities of human hormonal systems suggest a strong history of adaptation to variable environments. Physiological research on developmental plasticity has focused on the early programming effects of stress, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) and the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPGA) during critical periods, when the hormones produced have the strongest influence on the developing brain. Often this research emphasizes the maladaptive effects of early stressful experiences. Here we posit that the HPAA and HPAG systems in human developmental plasticity have evolved to be responsive to complex and dynamic problems associated with human sociality. The lengthy period of human offspring dependency, and its associated brain development and risks, is linked to the uniquely human combination of stable breeding bonds, extensive paternal effort in a multi-male group, extended bilateral kin recognition, grandparenting, and controlled exchange of mates among kin groups. We evaluate an evolutionary framework that integrates proximate physiological explanations with ontogeny, phylogeny, adaptive function, and comparative life history data. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V. ",

However, few studies have assessed whether the effects of early-life adversity on developmental telomere dynamics may relate to adult telomere dynamics. We propose that the potential links between early-life adversity and adult telomere dynamics could be driven by developmental constraints (the Constraint hypothesis), by the nature/severity of developmental adversity (the Resilience hypothesis), or by developmental-mediated changes in individual life-history strategies (the Pace of Life hypothesis). We discuss these non-mutually exclusive hypotheses, explore future research directions, and propose specific studies to test these hypotheses.

Past work has focused on how ovarian hormones respond to competition, but we know little about how the broader ovarian transcriptomic landscape changes, either during or after competition, giving us a narrow perspective on how socially induced phenotypes arise. Here, we experimentally generated social competition among wild, cavity-nesting female birds (tree swallows, Tachycineta bicolor), a species in which females lack a socially induced rise in circulating testosterone but they nevertheless increase allocation to eggs. After territory settlement, we reduced availability of nesting cavities, generating heightened competition; within 24 h we reversed the manipulation, causing aggressive interactions to subside. We measured ovarian transcriptomic responses at the peak of competition and 48 h later, along with date-matched controls. Network analyses indicated that competing females experienced an immediate and temporary decrease in the expression of genes involved in the early stages of steroidogenesis, and this was moderately correlated with plasma testosterone; however, two days after competition had ended, there was a marked increase in the expression of genes involved in the final stages of steroidogenesis, including HSD17B1. Gene networks related to the cell cycle, muscle performance, and extracellular matrix organization also displayed altered activity. Although the functional consequences of these findings are unclear, they shed light on socially responsive ovarian genomic mechanisms that could potentially exert lasting effects on behavior, reproduction, and maternal effects.

Although empirical evidence for delayed fitness costs of poor developmental conditions is abundant, individuals that die prematurely have not often been incorporated when estimating fitness, such that age-specific fitness costs, and therefore the relative importance of delayed fitness costs are actually unknown. We developed a Bayesian statistical framework to estimate age-specific reproductive values in relation to developmental conditions. We applied it to data obtained from a long-term longitudinal study of common terns Sterna hirundo, using sibling rank to describe variation in developmental conditions. Common terns have a maximum of three chicks, and later hatching chicks acquire less food, grow more slowly and have a lower fledging probability than their earlier hatched siblings. We estimated fitness costs in adulthood to constitute c. 45% and 70% of the total fitness costs of hatching third and second, respectively, compared to hatching first. This was due to third-ranked hatchlings experiencing especially high pre-fledging mortality, while second-ranked hatchlings had lower reproductive success in adulthood. Both groups had slightly lower adult survival. There was, however, no evidence for sibling rank-specific rates of senescence. We additionally found years with low fledgling production to be associated with particularly strong pre-fledging selection on sibling rank, and with increased adult survival to the next breeding season. This suggests that adults reduce parental allocation to reproduction in poor years, which disproportionately impacts low-ranked offspring. Interpreting these results, we suggest that selection at the level of the individual offspring for delaying fitness costs is counteracted by selection for parental reduction in brood size when resources are limiting.

Theory on the evolution of testosterone (T) was greatly advanced by the challenge hypothesis, which presented a framework for understanding interspecific, seasonal, and social variation in T levels in males, and how they are shaped by the competing demands of parental care and male-male competition. Female competition is also widespread in nature, although it is less clear whether or how the challenge hypothesis applies to females. Here, we evaluate this issue in four parts: (1) We summarize and update prior analyses of seasonal plasticity and interspecific variation in T in females. (2) We evaluate experimental links between T and female aggression on shorter timescales, asking how T manipulations affect aggression and conversely, how social manipulations affect T levels in female mammals, birds, lizards, and fishes. (3) We examine alternative mechanisms that may link aggression to the social environment independently of T levels in circulation. (4) We present a case study, including new data analyses, in an aggressive female bird (the tree swallow, Tachycineta bicolor) to explore how variation in tissue-level processing of T may bridge the gap between circulating T and variation in behavior that is visible to natural selection. We close by connecting these multivariate levels of sex steroid signaling systems alongside different temporal scales (social, seasonal, and evolutionary) to generate broadly applicable insights into how animals respond to their social environment, regardless of whether they are male or female.

Physiological stress reactions have been shown to affect the immune system of an animal and therefore may also affect the amount of maternal antibodies a female transmits to her offspring. A few studies have revealed that the presence of predators affects the amount of maternal antibodies deposited into eggs of birds. In this study, using Eurasian blue and great tit offspring (Cyanistes caeruleus and Parus major) as model species, we experimentally tested whether human recreation induces changes in the amount of circulating antibodies in young nestlings and whether this effect is modulated by habitat and competition. Moreover, we investigated whether these variations in antibody titre in turn have an impact on hatching success and offspring growth. Nestlings of great tit females that had been disturbed by experimental human recreation during egg laying had lower antibody titres compared with control nestlings. Antibody titre of nestling blue tits showed a negative correlation with the presence of great tits, rather than with human disturbance. The hatching success was positively correlated with the average amount of antibodies in great tit nestlings, independent of the treatment. Antibody titre in the first days of life in both species was positively correlated with body mass, but this relationship disappeared at fledging and was independent of treatment. We suggest that human recreation may have caused a stress-driven activation of the HPA axis in breeding females, chronically increasing their circulating corticosterone, which is known to have an immunosuppressive function. Either, lower amounts of antibodies are transmitted to nestlings or impaired transfer mechanisms lead to lower amounts of immunoglobulins in the eggs. Human disturbance could, therefore, have negative effects on nestling survival at early life-stages, when nestlings are heavily reliant on maternal antibodies, and in turn lead to lower breeding success and parental fitness. This is a so far overlooked effect of disturbance on early life in birds. Â© 2020 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.",

Examining the development of the hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis and its responsiveness, or lack thereof, during development are important for understanding the short- and long-term impacts of stressors on embryonic and larval fish. We examined the ontogeny of the HPI axis in embryonic (21, 38, 63, 83 and 103 days post-fertilisation (dpf)) and larval (1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks post-hatch (wph)) lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) by quantifying changes in mRNA levels of several genes associated with HPI axis functioning and whole animal cortisol levels throughout development and in response to a severe or mild hypoxic stress. Cortisol, and crh, crhbp1, pomc and star transcripts were detected from the earliest embryonic age studied. Cortisol levels in control embryos decreased between 21 and 63 dpf, suggesting the utilisation of maternal cortisol deposits. However, by 83 dpf (70% developed) endogenous de novo synthesis had generated a 4.5-fold increase in whole embryo cortisol. Importantly, we provide novel data showing that the HPI axis can be activated even earlier. Whole body cortisol increased in eyed lake whitefish embryos (38 dpf; ~32% developed) in response to hypoxia stress. Coincident with this hypoxia-induced increase in cortisol in 38 dpf embryos were corresponding increases in crh, crhbp1, pomc and star transcript levels. Beyond 38 dpf, the HPI axis in lake whitefish embryos was hyporesponsive to hypoxia stress at all embryonic ages examined (63, 83 and 103 dpf; 54, 72 and 85% developed, respectively). Post-hatch, larvae responded to hypoxia with an increase in cortisol levels and HPI axis genes at 1 wph, but this response was lost and larvae appeared hyporesponsive at subsequent ages (2, 3 and 4 wph). Collectively our work demonstrates that during fish embryogenesis and the larval stage there are windows where the HPI axis is responsive and windows where it is truly hyporesponsive; both could be beneficial in ensuring undisrupted development particularly in the face of increasing environmental changes.

This study addressed whether dietary supplementation with thymol can modulate the immune response of adult Japanese quail when simultaneously exposed to an inoculum of inactivated Salmonella Enteritidis and a chronic heat stress (CHS). We also evaluated whether the experienced situations by adults can affect the immune response of their undisturbed offspring. In the parental generation, supplemented quail exposed to CHS had a higher inflammatory response and similar values of the heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio than those that were not supplemented. In their offspring, those chicks whose parents were exposed to CHS showed higher inflammatory response and lower antibody production. Regarding the H/L ratio, chicks whose parents were supplemented showed lower H/L ratio values. Dietary supplementation with thymol partially and positively modulated the inflammatory response and avoided H/L ratio alteration in the parental generation exposed to high environmental temperatures, suggesting these adults were better at dealing with the challenge. The lower H/L ratio values in the offspring suggests that chicks are more capable to deal with potential stressful situations associated with conventional breeding conditions.

Maternal mediated effects have significant potential in the chicken meat industry, as breeder hens are feed restricted in a bid to improve performance. Evidence suggests breeder hens are chronically stressed, resulting from periods of prolonged hunger. However, evidence linking embryonic exposure to early-life stress and altered offspring phenotype in meat chickens is lacking. Additionally, methods to alleviate the phenotypic consequences of early-life stress have not been comprehensively explored. Nutritional supplementation with amino acids, such as arginine (Arg), may provide one such option, as Arg reportedly enhances performance characteristics in chicken meat birds. Aims: An in ovo study was conducted to investigate whether exposure to in ovo stress altered offspring performance in meat chickens. Additionally, Arg was supplemented post-hatch to alleviate reductions in performance, hypothesised to occur as a result of exposure to corticosterone. Method: A total of 400 eggs were divided into two groups and administered a corticosterone (CORT) or control (CON) solution at embryonic Day 11. At hatch, birds were separated into four groups based on in ovo and dietary treatments: CORT-Control, CORT-Arg, CON-Arg and CON-Control. Birds fed supplementary Arg diets received an Arg: lysine inclusion of 125%. Bodyweight (bwt) and feed conversion were recorded weekly. Birds were euthanised at embryonic Day 15, Day 0, 7, 21 (n = 40 birds/time point), 28 and 35 (n = 48 birds/time point) for organ collection. A total of 12 additional female birds were euthanised and subjected to a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan for body composition at Day 35. Results: Neither in ovo nor diet treatments influenced bwt, bwt gain, feed conversion or plasma corticosterone at any time point, nor did any in ovo by diet interaction exist. Female birds exposed to CORT exhibited significantly greater fat mass (%bwt P = 0.007) and reduced lean mass (%bwt P = 0.026) compared with CON females at Day 35. Supplementary Arg did not influence bird body composition. Conclusions: These findings suggest in ovo exposure to CORT may negatively influence body composition of female birds. Implications: Understanding the effects of the maternal/in ovo environment may provide a novel approach to further improve carcass quality and flock uniformity. Â© 2021 CSIRO.",

The developing gonads are an important source of estradiol but most, if not all, vertebrate embryos are also exposed to maternally derived estradiol during development. In birds, this maternally derived estradiol is present in the egg at the time of oviposition but very little is known about how this source of estradiol influences development. A critical aspect of understanding yolk estradiol effects is deciphering how steroid metabolism may regulate embryonic exposure to yolk estradiol. In this study, we examine the metabolic fate of estradiol during the first five days of incubation in chicken (Gallus gallus) eggs. Using tritiated estradiol to trace the movement and metabolism of estradiol, we demonstrate that estradiol is metabolized to estrone, which is subsequently conjugated to estrone sulfate as the primary metabolite. Estrone sulfate then accumulates in the albumen by day five of incubation. Overall, these findings have important implications for how yolk estradiol may influence development and alter offspring phenotype. Mechanisms through which estradiol, as well as estrone sulfate, might elicit effects are discussed.",

Whereas most studies have focused on subadult or adult subjects, neonates have been relatively neglected, despite studies showing that neonates can exhibit consistent inter-individual differences during early developmental stages. Steroid hormones, including glucocorticoids (e.g. cortisol) and androgens (e.g. testosterone), play a crucial role in foetal development and maturation and could therefore drive neonate behaviour, although this relationship is poorly understood in wild animal populations. Our study addresses these knowledge gaps by investigating the association between neonate fallow deer Dama dama fawn inter-individual variability in behavioural response to human handling and hair cortisol and testosterone levels. We found strong evidence that individual neonates display repeatable differences in the way they cope with a risky situation during their first days of life, and showed how these differences are linked to cortisol and testosterone levels accumulated in utero. We showed that, when both steroids are included in the same model, neonates with high cortisol and low testosterone levels coped in a more proactive way with human handling (higher heart rate during handling and shorter latency to leave when released) compared to those with low cortisol and high testosterone levels (lower heart rate and longer latency to leave). These results provide novel insights into the proximate mechanism leading to neonate inter-individual variation in a wild population of large mammals.

For males, the ability to achieve mating and fertilization success is a key social challenge. Competitive conditions may therefore favour increased body size or ejaculate production in male offspring. We tested this experimentally by comparing reproductive traits of adult male bank voles (Myodes glareolus), whose mothers had experienced contrasting encounter regimes with female conspecifics while breeding. We found that daily sperm production rates and epididymis mass were significantly higher when dams had experienced more frequent encounters with female conspecifics. This response to maternal and early life experience was specific to sperm production and storage, with no evidence for effects on male body mass or the size of testes and accessory reproductive glands. Our findings reveal a potentially adaptive effect of maternal and early life experience on the development of sperm production, which is worthy of wider investigation. Â© 2020 The Authors. ",
Hope2020.1,Incubation Temperature Affects Duckling Body Size and Food Consumption Despite No Effect on Associated Feeding Behaviors,"Hope, S.F. and Kennamer, R.A. and Grimaudo, A.T. and Hallagan, J.J. and Hopkins, W.A.",Integrative Organismal Biology,25174843,2,1,NA,,,2020,Oxford University Press,,,10.1093/iob/obaa003,"Synopsis Developmental conditions can have consequences for offspring fitness. For example, small changes (<1-C) in average avian incubation temperature have large effects on important post-hatch offspring phenotypes, including growth rate, thermoregulation, and behavior. Furthermore, average incubation temperatures differ among eggs within the same nest, to the extent (i.e., >1-C) that differences in offspring phenotypes within broods should result. A potential consequence of within-nest incubation temperature variation is inequality in behaviors that could cause differences in resource acquisition within broods. To investigate this, we incubated wood duck (Aix sponsa) eggs at one of two ecologically-relevant incubation temperatures (35-C or 36-C), formed mixed-incubation temperature broods after ducklings hatched, and conducted trials to measure duckling behaviors associated with acquisition of heat (one trial) or food (three trials). Contrary to our predictions, we found no effect of incubation temperature on duckling behaviors (e.g., time spent occupying heat source, frequency of feeding bouts). However, we found evidence that ducklings incubated at the higher temperature consumed more food during the 1-h feeding trials, and grew faster in body mass and structural size (culmen and tarsus) throughout the study, than those incubated at the lower temperature. Apparent food consumption during the trials was positively related to culmen length, suggesting that differences in food consumption may be driven by structural size. This could result in positive feedback, which would amplify size differences between offspring incubated at different temperatures. Thus, our study identifies incubation temperature as a mechanism by which fitness-related phenotypic differences can be generated and even amplified within avian broods. Â© 2020 OUP.

Birds that live in highly anthropized zones are confronted with physiological and behavioural challenges caused by these stressors. Here, we investigated if several health parameters differed between three subpopulations of tree sparrow nestlings subjected to different levels of anthropogenic pollution, and particularly noise pollution: a quiet rural area, a noisy rural area adjacent to an airport and a heavily urbanized area. We compared body condition, oxidative stress markers and baseline corticosterone levels, expecting urban nestlings to be in overall worse condition as compared to rural (rural and rural airport) birds. In addition, we expected nestlings exposed to aircraft noise to show intermediate stress levels. We found that rural-airport nestlings had the highest levels of antioxidant capacity of plasma and did not differ from rural counterparts in the rest of the parameters. By contrast, urban nestlings were in slightly worse body condition and had lower antioxidant capacity than rural and rural-airport individuals. Our results suggest that aircraft noise does not constitute a significant stressor for nestlings. In contrast, urban conditions constitute a more challenging situation, negatively impacting different physiological systems. Although nestlings seem able to buffer these challenges in the short-term, further research should explore the long-term potential consequences of early exposure to these conditions.

However, the reasons why personalities emerge, how they persist and the consequences they have in a changing environment are poorly understood. Factors influencing personalities include genetic background, prenatal (e.g. hormonal) and postnatal (e.g. environmental) conditions, and the strength of these factors can affect the consistency of personalities over time, and hence their flexibility in a changing environment. In birds, for example, hormones in eggs deposited by mothers can modulate aggressiveness of offspring and environmentally induced nutrition deficits in offspring can reduce neophobia later in life. Hence, investigating the fitness consequences of personalities requires the integration of physiological, behavioural and survival measures. We used the opportunity of a reintroduction project of grey partridge, Perdix perdix, to experimentally explore how multiple pre- and postnatal factors including measures of the hormone corticosterone were related to three behavioural traits. Then, we investigated whether the behaviours were repeatable and related to survival after release into the wild. Grey partridges showed distinct personalities affected by multiple pre- and postnatal factors. Proactive birds had low baseline levels of circulating corticosterone and survived longer after release into the wild compared to reactive and passive personalities. Consequently, the number of survivors after 6 months was substantially higher for proactive than for reactive and passive birds. Integrating data on behaviour, physiology and survival thus allows the investigation of the complex interplay of personality and fitness in a changing environment. Â© 2021 The Authors",

Also, our understanding of hormonal age-dependent changes in testosterone levels is limited. We assessed plasma testosterone levels in 105 samples originating from 49 repeatedly captured free-living great tits (Parus major) sampled during the nesting to investigate their relative long-term repeatability and within-individual changes. Furthermore, we examined the inter-annual repeatability of condition-related traits (carotenoid- and melanin-based plumage ornamentation, ptilochronological feather growth rate, body mass, and haematological heterophil/lymphocyte ratio) and their relationships to testosterone levels. We show that testosterone levels are inter-annually repeatable in females, with a non-significant pattern in males, both in absolute values and individual ranks (indicating the maintenance of relative status in a population). In males, we found a quadratic dependence of testosterone levels on age, with a peak in midlife. In contrast, female testosterone levels showed no age-dependent trends. The inter-annual repeatability of condition-related traits ranged from zero to moderate and was mostly unrelated to plasma testosterone concentrations. However, males with elevated testosterone had significantly higher carotenoid-pigmented yellow plumage brightness, a trait presumably involved in mating. Showing inter-annual repeatability in testosterone levels, this research opens the way to further understanding the causes of variation in condition-related traits. Based on a longitudinal dataset, this study demonstrates that male plasma testosterone undergoes age-related changes that may regulate resource allocation. Our results thus suggest that, unlike females, male birds undergo hormonal senescence similar to mammals.

Maternal stress can programme physiological and behavioural phenotypes in offspring, which may be maladaptive if maternal and offspring environments are mismatched. We investigated effects of a match and mismatch between egg cortisol and offspring stress levels in lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, using artificially elevated egg cortisol levels (simulating maternal stress) and a chronic unpredictable stress regime for offspring after hatch. Offspring cortisol levels were quantified at baseline and after an acute stressor. Multiple measures of offspring swimming activity were assessed in behaviour trials. Individuals that experienced elevated egg cortisol and high offspring stress exhibited a diminished cortisol response to an acute stressor, but responses varied among offspring from different families. Results suggest that the interaction between maternal and offspring experience may cue an offspring phenotype that is adaptive in high-stress conditions. Principal components analysis characterizing interindividual variation in offspring behavioural variables showed that treatment significantly affected multivariate offspring response along the PC1 axis (associated with inactivity), and both treatment and family significantly affected response along the PC2 axis (associated with shorter distance moved). The largest differences for PC1 occurred between the `mismatch' treatments (high egg cortisol and low offspring stress exhibiting lower activity; low egg cortisol and high offspring stress exhibiting higher activity), indicating that the combination of egg cortisol and offspring stress is more important in determining offspring behaviour than is egg cortisol or offspring stress alone. Findings suggest that family effects, such as genetic components or maternal experience, may mediate how the interaction of maternal and offspring stress influences offspring physiological and behavioural outcomes, and indicate the need for further research into environmental factors experienced by females that influence how offspring respond to egg cortisol and early life stress.

This review will focus on metamorphoses and developmental transitions in vertebrates, including typical larval metamorphosis in anuran amphibians, larval and secondary metamorphoses in teleost fishes, egg hatching in sauropsids and birth in mammals. Two neuroendocrine axes, the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal/interrenal axes, are central players in the regulation of these life transitions. The review will address the molecular and functional evolution of these axes and their interactions. Mechanisms of integration of internal and environmental cues, and activation of these neuroendocrine axes represent key questions in an â€œeco-evo-devoâ€ perspective of metamorphosis. The roles played by developmental transitions in the innovation, adaptation, and plasticity of life cycles throughout vertebrates will be discussed.

Oxidative damage may mediate such effects, yet evidence that oxidative damage experienced by parents during reproduction negatively affects offspring fitness is scarce and limited to early life stages. We show in Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) thatmaternal levels of oxidative damage, measured during reproduction, negatively predict the number of offspring produced by daughters. This maternal effect on daughtersâ€™ reproductive success was mediated by an effect on hatching success rather than on the number of eggs laid by daughters. We also observed a negative association between fathersâ€™ oxidative damage levels and the number of eggs laid by daughters but a positive association between fathersâ€™ oxidative damage levels and the hatching success of those eggs. These opposing paternal effects canceled each other out, resulting in no overall effect on the number of offspring produced by daughters. No significant association between a femaleâ€™s ownlevelofoxidative damage during reproduction and her reproductive success was observed. Our results suggest that oxidative damage experienced by parents is a better predictor of an individualâ€™s reproductive performance than oxidative damage experienced by the individual itself. Although the mechanisms underlying these parental condition transfer effects are currently unknown, changes in egg composition or (epi)genetic alterations of gametes may play a role. These findings highlight the importance of an intergenerational perspective when quantifying costs of physiological stress. Â© 2021 The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.",

The effects of pre- and post-natal conditions on fitness prospects have been widely studied but their interactive effects have received less attention. In birds, asynchronous hatching creates challenging developmental conditions for the last-hatched chicks, but differential allocation in last-laid eggs might help to compensate this initial handicap. The relative importance and potential interaction between pre- and post-hatching developmental conditions for different fitness components remains mostly unknown. We manipulated hatching order in wild pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca), creating three groups: natural asynchrony (last-laid eggs hatching last), reversed asynchrony (last-laid eggs hatching first) and hatching synchrony (all eggs hatching at once). We examined the effects of these manipulations on early-life survival, growth and telomere length, a potential cellular biomarker of fitness prospects. Mortality was mostly affected by hatching order, with lasthatched chicks being more likely to die. Early-life telomere dynamics and growth were influenced by the interplays between laying and hatching order. Last-laid but first-hatched chicks were heavier but had shorter telomeres 5 days after hatching than their siblings, indicating rapid early growth with potential adverse consequences on telomere length. Synchronous chicks did not suffer any apparent cost of hatching synchronously. Impaired phenotypes only occurred when reversing the natural hatching order (i.e. developmental mismatch), suggesting that maternal investment in last-laid eggs might indeed counterbalance the initial handicap of last-hatched chicks. Our experimental study thus highlights that potential interplays between pre- and post-natal environments are likely to shape fitness prospects in the wild. Â© 2021.

Here we examine whether and how intralocus conflicts contribute to balancing selection stabilizing an autosomal inversion polymorphism in the ruff Calidris pugnax. In this lekking shorebird, three male mating morphs (Independents, Satellites and Faeders) are controlled by an inversion-based supergene. We show that in a captive population, Faeder females, who are smaller and whose inversion haplotype has not undergone recombination, have lower average reproductive success in terms of laying rate, egg size, and offspring survival than Independent females, who lack the inversion. Satellite females, who carry a recombined inversion haplotype and have intermediate body size, more closely resemble Independent than Faeder females in reproductive performance. We inferred that the lower reproductive output of Faeder females is most likely balanced by higher than average reproductive success of individual Faeder males. These findings suggest that intralocus conflicts may play a major role in the evolution and maintenance of supergene variants. Â© 2022, The Author(s). ",
Sarraude2021,Is maternal thyroid hormone deposition subject to a trade-off between self and egg because of iodine? An experimental study in rock pigeon,"Sarraude, T. and Hsu, B.-Y. and Ruuskanen, S. and Groothuis, T.",Journal of Experimental Biology,220949,224,20,NA,,,2021,Company of Biologists Ltd,,,10.1242/jeb.242203,"Maternal hormones constitute a key signalling pathway for mothers to shape offspring phenotype and fitness. Thyroid hormones (THs; triiodothyronine, T3; and thyroxine, T4) are metabolic hormones known to play crucial roles in embryonic development and survival in all vertebrates. During early developmental stages, embryos exclusively rely on exposure to maternal THs, and maternal hypothyroidism can cause severe embryonic maldevelopment. The TH molecule includes iodine, an element that cannot be synthesised by the organism. Therefore, TH production may become costly when environmental iodine availability is low. This may yield a trade-off for breeding females between allocating the hormones to self or to their eggs, potentially to the extent that it even influences the number of laid eggs. In this study, we investigated whether low dietary iodine may limit TH production and transfer to the eggs in a captive population of rock pigeons (Columba livia). We provided breeding females with an iodine-restricted (Iâˆ’) diet or iodine-supplemented (I+) diet and measured the resulting circulating and yolk iodine and TH concentrations and the number of eggs laid. Our iodine-restricted diet successfully decreased both circulating and yolk iodine concentrations compared with the supplemented diet, but not circulating or yolk THs. This indicates that mothers may not be able to independently regulate hormone exposure for self and their embryos. However, egg production was clearly reduced in the Iâˆ’ group, with fewer females laying eggs. This result shows that restricted availability of iodine does induce a cost in terms of egg production. Whether females reduced egg production to preserve THs for themselves or to prevent embryos from exposure to low iodine and/or THs is as yet unclear. Â© 2021 Company of Biologists Ltd.

Karger AG,,,10.1159/000515187,"In species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), incubation temperatures regulate the expression of genes involved in gonadal differentiation and determine whether the gonads develop into ovaries or testes. For most species, natural incubation conditions result in transient exposure to thermal cues for both ovarian and testis development, but how individuals respond to this transient exposure varies and can drive variation in the resulting sex ratios. Here, we argue that variation in the timing to respond to temperature cues, or thermal responsiveness, is a trait needing further study. Recent work in the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta) has found that when embryos experience transient exposure to warm conditions (i.e., heatwaves), some embryos show high responsiveness, requiring only short exposures to commit to ovarian development, while others show low responsiveness, developing testes even after more extended exposures to warm conditions. We discuss how maternal estrogens might influence thermal responsiveness for organisms that develop under thermal fluctuations. Examining the interplay of molecular responses to more subtle thermal and endocrine environments may reveal significant insights into the process of sex determination in species with TSD. Â© 2021 S.

However, most knowledge comes from captive animals or long-lived slow growing species. Moreover, little is known about how innate immune function, the important first line of defence, develops during early life in fast-growing animals such as free-living passerines. We studied development of innate baseline immune function in nestlings of free-living jackdaws Corvus monedula. We measured four immune parameters (hemolysis, hemagglutination, bacterial-killing capacity, haptoglobin concentration) and structural body size (body mass, wing length, tarsus length) at day 12 and day 29 post-hatching. We found that three out of four immune parameters (hemolysis, hemagglutination, bacterial-killing capacity) substantially increased with nestling age and had roughly reached adult levels shortly prior to fledging. We found little differences in immune development between males and females despite them differing in structural development. We also found no evidence that the nestlings traded off immune development with growth. That nestlings rapidly increase innate baseline immune function during early life and similarly in males and females indicates the importance of a well-functioning immune system already during the nestling phase.

This is because it is challenging to obtain sufficient data, particularly for behaviors involving interactions between individuals. Here, we explore an indirect approach for pilot investigations of the role of genetic differences in generating variation in parental care. Variation in parental genetic effects for offspring performance is expected to arise from among-parent genetic variation in parental care. Therefore, we used the animal model to predict maternal breeding values for lamb growth and used these predictions to select females for field observation, where maternal and lamb behaviors were recorded. Higher predicted maternal breeding value for lamb growth was associated with greater suckling success, but not with any other measures of suckling behavior. Though our work cannot explicitly estimate the genetic basis of the specific traits involved, it does provide a strategy for hypothesis generation and refinement that we hope could be used to justify data collection costs needed for confirmatory studies. Here, results suggest that behavioral genetic variation is involved in generating maternal genetic effects on lamb growth in Soay sheep. Though important caveats and cautions apply, our approach may extend the ability to initiate more genetic investigations of difficult-to-study behaviors and social interactions in natural populations.

However, embryos that use most, or all, of their yolk supply before hatching should hatch at a larger size than those that do not exhaust those energy reserves, which could also have benefits for posthatching growth and survival. To examine the trade-off between residual yolk and offspring size, we experimentally reduced yolk quantity at oviposition in lizard eggs (Amphibolurus mu-ricatus) and then quantified offspring size and the amount of internalized residual yolk. This design enabled us to determine whether embryos (1) exhaust yolk supply during development (thereby maximizing neonatal size) or (2) reduce neonatal size by retaining yolk reserves at hatching. Our data support the latter scenario. Eggs from the yolk-reduced treatment produced smaller offspring with a proportion of residual yolk similar to that of offspring from unmanipulated eggs, suggesting that the fitness benefits of posthatching energy stores outweigh those of larger neonatal size.

It has often been argued that these phenotypic responses could be the result of micro-evolutionary changes following the urbanization process. However, other mechanisms such as phenotypic plasticity, maternal effects, and developmental plasticity could be involved as well. To address maternal effects as potential mechanisms, we compared maternal hormone and antibody concentrations in eggs between city and forest populations of European blackbirds (Turdus merula), a widely distributed species for which previous research demonstrated differences in behavioral and physiological traits. We measured egg and yolk mass, yolk concentrations of androgens (androstenedione [A4], testosterone [T], 5Î±-dihydrotestosterone [5Î±-DHT], and immunoglobulins [IgY]) and related them to population, clutch size, laying order, embryo sex, and progress of breeding season. We show (a) earlier onset of laying in the city than forest population, but similar egg and clutch size; (b) higher overall yolk androgen concentrations in the forest than the city population (sex-dependent for T); (c) greater among-female variation of yolk T and 5Î±-DHT concentrations in the forest than city population, but similar within-clutch variation; (d) similar IgY concentrations with a seasonal decline in both populations; and (e) population-specific positive (city) or negative (forest) association of yolk A4 and T with IgY concentrations. Our results are consistent with the hypotheses that hormone-mediated maternal effects contribute to differences in behavioral and physiological traits between city and forest individuals and that yolk androgen and immunoglobulin levels can exhibit population-specific relationships rather than trade-off against each other.

The â€˜CORT-fitness hypothesisâ€™ proposes that high levels of CORT arise from challenging environmental conditions, resulting in lower reproductive success (a negative relationship). In contrast, the CORT-adaptation hypothesis suggests that, during energetically demanding periods, CORT will mediate physiological or behavioral changes that result in increased reproductive investment and success (a positive relationship). During two breeding seasons, we experimentally manipulated circulating CORT levels in female tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) prior to egg laying, and measured subsequent reproductive effort, breeding success, and maternal survival. When females were recaptured during egg incubation and again during the nestling stage, the CORT levels were similar among individuals in each treatment group, and maternal treatment had no effect on indices of fitness. By considering variation among females, we found support for the CORT-adaptation hypothesis; there was a significant positive relationship between CORT levels during incubation and hatching and fledging success. During the nestling stage CORT levels were unrelated to any measure of investment or success.

Telomere length shortening is a known biomarker of aging and aging related diseases. Its measure at birth or early in life is considered as a predictor of individual health in adulthood. Here, we performed a case-control study to investigate whether maternal opioid use affects newborns relative telomere length (RTL). 57 mother-newborn dyads were included in this study, 30 neonates with opioid using mothers (OM), and 27 with not-opioid using mothers (NOM)). RTL was measured in leukocyte cells genomic DNA using real-time PCR. The correlation of maternal opioid use with neonates telomer length was assessed using logistic regression analysis. The results displayed a significant association between odds ratio of long RTL and maternal opioid use when sensitivity analysis was performed by neonate sex; where the data indicates significantly increased odds ratio of long leukocyte RTL in association with maternal opioid use in male neonates only.

Perceived predation risk can affect both parent and offspring phenotype, but it remains unclear to what extent offspring behavioral traits are affected when the mother is exposed to predation risk. This is particularly unclear in live-bearing species where maternal effects could occur during embryogenesis. Here, using a half-sib design to control for paternal effects, we experimentally exposed females of a live-bearing fish, the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), to visual predator cues and conspecific alarm cues during their gestation. Females exposed to predation risk cues increased their antipredator behaviors throughout the entire treatment. Offspring of mothers exposed to the predation stimuli exhibited more pronounced exploratory behavior, but did not show any significant differences in their schooling behavior, compared to controls. Thus, while maternally perceived risk affected offspring's exploration during early stages of life, offspring's schooling behavior could be influenced more by direct environmental experience rather than via maternal cues. Our results suggest a rather limited role in predator-induced maternal effects on the behavior of juvenile guppies. Â© The Author(s) 2020.

Most tests of the model focus on morphological proxies of fitness, such as size traits, whereas early life physiological traits that are closely related to lifetime fitness might provide a framework for generalizing the Charnov-Bull model across taxa. One such trait is the strength of the early-life immune response, which is strongly linked to early-life survival and fitness. Here, we manipulated temperature, variance in temperature, and sex to test the Charnov-Bull model using a physiological trait, immune system strength, in the snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina). We found no evidence of sex-specific differences in bactericidal capacity of hatchling blood, and no evidence that mean temperature influences bactericidal capacity. However, we did find that fluctuating incubation temperature (i.e. a more naturalized incubation regime) is associated with a greater bactericidal capacity compared with constant temperature incubation. We also found that egg mass, a proxy for maternal provisioning, is positively associated with bactericidal capacity. Our findings suggest that the evolution of temperaturedependent sex determination in reptiles is unrelated to our measure of early-life innate immunity. Our study also underlines how immune response is condition dependent in early life, and questions the biological relevance of constant temperature incubation in experimental studies on ectotherm development.

These maternal effects have major implications for fitness because, by shaping early development, they can permanently alter how offspring interact with their environment. However, theory on parent-offspring conflict and recent physiological studies showing that embryos rapidly metabolize maternal steroids have placed doubt on the adaptive significance of these hormone-mediated maternal effects. Reconciling these disparate perspectives requires a mechanistic understanding of the pathways by which maternal steroids can influence neural development. Here, we highlight recent advances in developmental neurobiology and psychiatric pharmacology to show that maternal steroid metabolites can have direct neuro-modulatory effects potentially shaping the development of neural circuitry underlying ecologically relevant behavioural traits. The recognition that maternal steroids can act through a neurosteroid pathway has critical implications for our understanding of the ecology and evolution of steroid-based maternal effects. Overall, compared to the classic view, a neurosteroid mechanism may reduce the evolutionary lability of hormone-mediated maternal effects owing to increased pleiotropic constraints and frequently influence long-term behavioural phenotypes in offspring.

Maternally transferred THs are important for normal early phase embryonic development when embryos are not able to produce endogenous THs. Previous studies have shown that variation in maternal THs within the physiological range can influence offspring phenotype. Given the essential functions of maternal THs in development and metabolism, THs may be a mediator of life-history variation across species. We tested the hypothesis that differences in life histories are associated with differences in maternal TH transfer across species. Using birds as a model, we specifically tested whether maternally transferred yolk THs covary with migratory status, developmental mode and traits related to pace-of-life (e.g. basal metabolic rate, maximum life span). We collected un-incubated eggs (nÂ = 1â€“21 eggs per species, medianÂ =Â 7) from 34 wild and captive bird species across 17 families and six orders to measure yolk THs [both triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4)], compiled life-history trait data from the literature and used Bayesian phylogenetic mixed models to test our hypotheses. Our models indicated that both concentrations and total amounts of the two main forms of THs (T3 and T4) were higher in the eggs of migratory species compared to resident species, and total amounts were higher in the eggs of precocial species, which have longer prenatal developmental periods, than in those of altricial species. However, maternal yolk THs did not show clear associations with pace-of-life-related traits, such as fecundity, basal metabolic rate or maximum life span. We quantified interspecific variation in maternal yolk THs in birds, and our findings suggest higher maternal TH transfer is associated with the precocial mode of development and migratory status. Whether maternal THs represent a part of the mechanism underlying the evolution of precocial development and migration or a consequence of such life histories is currently unclear. We therefore encourage further studies to explore the physiological mechanisms and evolutionary processes underlying these patterns. Â© 2022 The Authors.

Thus, as climate change leads to rapid increases in water temperatures in rivers, aquatic ectotherms, such as fish may be highly impacted. Organisms can respond to these stressors through flexible and rapid phenotypic change induced via developmental and/or transgenerational plasticity. In oviparous species, gravid females may translate environmental stress across generations via increased exposure of eggs to maternally derived glucocorticoids (i.e., maternal stress), which has been shown to result in diverse phenotypic effects in offspring. Recent studies suggest these phenotypic changes from maternal glucocorticoids may elicit predictive adaptive responses, where offspring exposed to maternal stress may be better prepared for the stressful environment they will encounter (i.e., environmental match hypothesis). We applied the environmental match hypothesis to examine whether a prenatal exogenous increase in egg cortisol may prepare Chinook salmon offspring (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) to cope with thermal challenges after being reared in chronically elevated temperatures. Specifically, we exposed eggs to aqueous bath of cortisol-dosed (1,000 ng/mL) or control (0 ng/ml) solutions, and then raised both treatments at current (+0Â°Câ€”contemporary ambient river temperature) or elevated (+3Â°Câ€”projected future river temperature) thermal regimes. We quantified thermal performance in fish 7â€“9 month post fertilization using two methods: via critical thermal maximum (CTMax), and energetic responses (in plasma cortisol, glucose, and lactate) to environmentally relevant, but challenging thermal spikes over 3 days. Overall, we found that exposure to elevated rearing temperatures had a large impact on thermal tolerance, where elevated-temperature reared offspring had significantly higher CTMax. In comparison, egg cortisol treatment had little to no clear effects on CTMax and blood energetic response. Our study demonstrates the importance of elevated water temperatures as an inducer of offspring phenotypes (via early developmental cues), and highlights the significance of examining offspring performance in environments with ecologically relevant stressors.

Concerted environmental challenges might induce trade-off when resource allocation to one trait occurs at the expense of another, also producing potential transgenerational effects in the offspring.We evaluated whether concerted challenges, in the form of an immune inoculum against inactivated Salmonella enteritidis (immune challenge, ICH) and a chronic heat stress (CHS) exposure on adult Japanese quail, modulate the INE responses of the parental generation and their offspring. Adults were inoculated and later exposed to a CHS along nine consecutive days. For the last 5 days of the CHS, eggs were collected for incubation. Chicks were identified according to their parental treatments and remained undisturbed. Induced inflammatory response, heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio and specific humoral response against sheep red blood cells (SRBC) were evaluated in both generations. Regardless of the ICH, stressed adults showed a reduced inflammatory response and an elevated H/L ratio compared with controls. In offspring, the inflammatory response was elevated and the specific SRBC antibody titres were diminished in those chicks prenatally exposed to CHS, regardless of the ICH. No differences were found in the H/L ratio of the offspring. Together, our results suggest that CHS exposure influences the INE interplay of adult quail, establishing trade-offs within their immune system. Moreover, CHS not only affected parental INE responses but alsomodulated their offspring INE responses, probably affecting their potential to respond to future challenges. The adaptability of the developmental programming of offspring would depend on the environment encountered. Â© 2020 Company of Biologists Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In turn, the biological quality of eggs influences hatchability and chick fitness. The aim of this study was to compare pheasant Phasianus colchicus eggs containing male and female embryos and laid in different months in terms of their morphology (egg weight, egg shape, yolk and white content, eggshell thickness) and biochemical traits (chemical composition, lysozyme content and activity, fatty acid profile as well as contents of macro-and microelements). The experimental material comprised eggs obtained from 1-year-old pheasants. Altogether 200 eggs were collected on April 7 and June 23 (100 eggs on each date). As some eggs were destroyed before and during measurements, numbers of eggs taken into account in the analysis of egg morphology traits were lower than numer of collected eggs. Egg homogenates were used in other analyses, sample size for each date ranged from 12-24. In conclusion, we stated that common pheasant eggs containing embryos of either sex did not differ in terms of morphology, basic chemical composition and a majority of other investigated traits, but eggs laid in April and June differed in terms of many studied traits (egg morphology, basic chemical composition, lysozyme content, some elements and fatty acids). Differences mentioned above can be explained by the egg laying date (female age), but environmental factors such as temperature and photoperiod might also affect egg traits.

Yet organisms live in multifaceted environments that are dynamic and ever changing, making it difficult to understand how complex adaptations evolve. This problem is particularly apparent in the evolution of adaptive maternal effects, which are often assumed to require reliable and discrete cues that predict conditions in the offspring environment. One resolution to this problem is if adaptive maternal effects evolve through preexisting, generalized maternal pathways that respond to many cues and also influence offspring development. Here, we assess whether an adaptive maternal effect in western bluebirds is influenced by maternal stress pathways across multiple challenging environments. Combining 18 years of hormone sampling across diverse environmental contexts with an experimental manipulation of the competitive environment, we show that multiple environmental factors influenced maternal corticosterone levels, which, in turn, influenced a maternal effect on aggression of sons in adulthood. Together, these results support the idea that multiple stressors can induce a known maternal effect in this system. More generally, they suggest that activation of general pathways, such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, may simplify and facilitate the evolution of adaptive maternal effects by integrating variable environmental conditions into preexisting maternal physiological systems.

In birds, recent studies have demonstrated that different yolk substances can interactively affect offspring phenotype, but the implications of such effects for offspring fitness and phenotype in natural populations have remained unclear. We measured natural variation in the content of 31 yolk components known to shape offspring phenotypes including steroid hormones, antioxidants and fatty acids in eggs of free-living great tits (Parus major) during two breeding seasons. We tested for relationships between yolk component groupings and offspring fitness and phenotypes. Results: Variation in hatchling and fledgling numbers was primarily explained by yolk fatty acids (including saturated, mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids)Â -Â but not by androgen hormones and carotenoids, components previously considered to be major determinants of offspring phenotype. Fatty acids were also better predictors of variation in nestling oxidative status and size than androgens and carotenoids. Conclusions: Our results suggest that fatty acids are important yolk substances that contribute to shaping offspring fitness and phenotype in free-living populations. Since polyunsaturated fatty acids cannot be produced de novo by the mother, but have to be obtained from the diet, these findings highlight potential mechanisms (e.g., weather, habitat quality, foraging ability) through which environmental variation may shape maternal effects and consequences for offspring. Our study represents an important first step towards unraveling interactive effects of multiple yolk substances on offspring fitness and phenotypes in free-living populations. It provides the basis for future experiments that will establish the pathways by which yolk components, singly and/or interactively, mediate maternal effects in natural populations.

Although it is now known that most traits are a product of both heredity (â€œnatureâ€) and the environment (â€œnurtureâ€), these two driving forces of trait development are rarely examined together. In birds, one important aspect of the early developmental environment is egg incubation temperature. Small changes (<1Â°C) in incubation temperature can have large effects on a wide-array of offspring traits. One important trait is metabolism, because it is related to life-history traits and strategies, organismal performance, and energetic and behavioral strategies. Although it has been shown that embryonic and post-hatch metabolism are related to egg incubation temperature, little is known about how this may vary as a function of genetic differences or post-hatching environmental conditions. Here, we investigated this question in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). We experimentally incubated eggs at two different temperatures: 37.5Â°C (control), which is optimal for this species and 36.3Â°C (low), which is suboptimal. We first measured embryonic heart rate as a proxy of embryonic metabolic rate. Then, at hatch, we cross-fostered nestlings to differentiate genetic and pre-hatching factors from post-hatching environmental conditions. When offspring were 30Â days-old, we measured their resting metabolic rate (RMR; within the thermoneutral zone) and thermoregulatory metabolic rate (TMR; 12Â°C; birds must actively thermoregulate). We also measured RMR and TMR of all genetic and foster parents. We found that embryonic heart rate was greater in eggs incubated at the control temperature than those at the low temperature. Further, embryonic heart rate was positively related to genetic father RMR, suggesting that it is both heritable and affected by the pre-natal environment. In addition, we found that post-hatch metabolic rates were positively related to genetic parent metabolic rate, and interactively related to incubation temperature and foster mother metabolic rate. Altogether, this suggests that metabolism and the energetic cost of thermoregulation can be influenced by genetics, the pre-natal environment, and the post-natal environment. Our study sheds light on how environmental changes and parental care may affect avian physiology, as well as which traits may be susceptible to natural selection.

Lundblad2021,Nest microclimate and limits to egg viability explain avian life-history variation across latitudinal gradients,"Lundblad, C.G. and Conway, C.J.",Ecology,129658,102,6,NA,,,2021,Ecological Society of America,,,10.1002/ecy.3338,"Variation in life-history strategies is central to our understanding of population dynamics and how organisms adapt to their environments. Yet we lack consensus regarding the ecological processes that drive variation in traits related to reproduction and survival. For example, we still do not understand the cause of two widespread inter- and intraspecific patterns: (1) the ubiquitous positive association between avian clutch size and latitude; and (2) variation in the extent of asynchronous hatching of eggs within a single clutch. Well-known hypotheses to explain each pattern have largely focused on biotic processes related to food availability and predation risk. However, local adaptation to maintain egg viability could explain both patterns with a single abiotic mechanism. The egg viability hypothesis was initially proposed to explain the cause of asynchronous hatching and suggests that asynchronous hatching results from early incubation onset in response to unfavorable nest microclimatic conditions, which otherwise reduce egg viability. However, allocation of resources to early incubation, prior to clutch completion, may energetically constrain clutch size and help explain the positive association between clutch size and latitude. We measured intraspecific variation in five functionally linked life-history traits of burrowing owls at five study sites spanning a 1,400-km latitudinal transect in western North America: clutch size, the timing of incubation onset, the degree of hatching asynchrony, the probability of hatching failure, and nestling survival. We found that most traits varied clinally with latitude, but all the traits were more strongly associated with individual nest microclimates than with latitude, and all varied with nest microclimate in the directions predicted by the egg viability hypothesis. Furthermore, incubation began earlier, hatching asynchrony increased, and clutch size declined across the breeding season. These results suggest that nest microclimate drives an important life-history trade-off and that thermal gradients are often sufficient to account for observed biogeographic and seasonal patterns in life-history strategies. Furthermore, our results reveal a potentially important indirect mechanism by which reproductive success and recruitment could be affected by climate change.

In songbirds, yolk androgens influence offspring growth and begging behaviors, which can help mitigate offspring predation risk in the nest. Other steroids may also be important for responding to nest predation risk, but non-androgen steroids have been poorly studied. We used a nest predator playback experiment and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) to assess whether nest predation risk influences deposition of 10 yolk steroids. We found no clear evidence that yolk androgen deposition changed when perception of nest predation risk was experimentally increased. However, elevated nest predation risk led to decreased yolk progesterone deposition. Overall, our results suggest yolk progesterone may be more important than yolk androgens in responses to offspring predation risk and highlight new avenues for research. Â© 2022.

While much attention has been paid to behavioral and morphological patterns associated with sex-role reversal, less is known about its physiological regulation. Here, we evaluate hypotheses relating to the neuroendocrine basis of sex-role reversal. We refute the most widely tested activational hypothesis for sex differences in androgen secretion; sex-role reversed females do not have higher levels of androgens in circulation than males. However, we find some evidence that the effects of androgens may be sex-specific; circulating androgen levels correlate with some competitive phenotypes in sex-role reversed females. We also review evidence that sex-role reversed females have higher tissue-specific sensitivity to androgens than males, at least in some species and tissues. Organizational effects may explain these relationships, considering that early exposure to sex steroids can shape later sensitivity to hormones, often in sex-specific ways. Moving forward, experimental and correlative studies on the ontogeny and expression of sexrole reversal will further clarify the mechanisms that generate sex-specific behaviors and sex roles.

This paper discusses the need for multilevel explanation; Huxley and Mayrâ€™s prior models, and others that followed; Tinbergenâ€™s differences with Lorenz on â€œthe innateâ€; and Mayrâ€™s ultimate/proximate distinction. It synthesizes these approaches with nine levels of explanation in three categories: phylogeny, natural selection, and genomics (ultimate causes); maturation, sensitive period effects, and routine environmental effects (intermediate causes); and hormonal/metabolic processes, neural circuitry, and eliciting stimuli (proximate causes), as a respectful extension of Tinbergenâ€™s levels. The proposed classification supports and builds on Tinbergenâ€™s multilevel model and Mayrâ€™s ultimate/proximate continuum, adding intermediate causes in accord with Tinbergenâ€™s emphasis on ontogeny. It requires no modification of Standard Evolutionary Theory or The Modern Synthesis, but shows that much that critics claim was missing was in fact part of Neo-Darwinian theory (so named by J. Mark Baldwin in The American Naturalist in 1896) all along, notably reciprocal causation in ontogeny, niche construction, cultural evolution, and multilevel selection. Updates of classical examples in ethology are offered at each of the nine levels, including the neuroethological and genomic findings Tinbergen foresaw. Finally, human examples are supplied at each level, fulfilling his hope of human applications as part of the biology of behavior. This broad ethological framework empowers us to explain human behaviorâ€”eventually completelyâ€”and vindicates the idea of human nature, and of humans as a part of nature.

However, many studies report negative effects of stress experienced by one generation on the performance of subsequent generations. To assess the strength of such transgenerational effects we propose a strategy aimed at overcoming the problem of type I errors when testing multiple proxies of stress in multiple ancestors against multiple offspring performance traits, and we apply it to a large observational dataset on captive zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). We combine clear one-tailed hypotheses with steps of validation, meta-analytic summary of mean effect sizes, and independent confirmatory testing. We find that drastic differences in early growth conditions (nestling body mass 8 days after hatching varied sevenfold between 1.7 and 12.4 g) had only moderate direct effects on adult morphology (95% confidence interval [CI]: r = 0.19â€“0.27) and small direct effects on adult fitness traits (r = 0.02â€“0.12). In contrast, we found no indirect effects of parental or grandparental condition (r = âˆ’0.017 to 0.002; meta-analytic summary of 138 effect sizes), and mixed evidence for small benefits of matching environments between parents and offspring, as the latter was not robust to confirmatory testing in independent datasets. This study shows that evolution has led to a remarkable robustness of zebra finches against undernourishment. Our study suggests that transgenerational effects are absent in this species, because CIs exclude all biologically relevant effect sizes. Â© 2020 The Authors.

It was assumed that Mew Gull females in poor condition would produce more daughters (10-15% smaller than males). The condition of females was reduced by removing first clutches shortly after completion, inducing a second clutch. Non-manipulated pairs that laid first clutches at the same time constituted controls. In first clutches (control, 3 eggs), the mean proportion of daughters at hatching was 51.0 Â± 15.4% (n = 50), and on the fifth day after hatching was 51.2 Â± 12.0% (n = 48). The share of broods with a predominance of daughters in both periods was similar (range = 47.9-48.0%). In experimentally induced replacement clutches (3-egg), the mean proportion of daughters was higher than in first clutches both at hatching (69.3 Â± 14.9%; n = 45) and 5 daysays after hatching (62.1 Â± 16.2 %; n = 42). Offspring sex ratio at hatching reflected the current condition of females, corresponding with predictions of the cost of reproduction hypothesis. Frequency of replacement broods with a predominance of daughters declined between hatching (77.8%) and the fifth day after hatching (59.5%), reducing broods in favor of males; and more frequent losses were observed at 5 daysays after hatching in replacement broods (of which only âˆ¼13% of broods were without losses) compared to first broods (46.0% without losses).

Insectivorous birds exploit these cues and, consequently, reduce the damages inflicted to the plants. However, little is known about whether they solely use HIPVs as foraging cues, or if they also use them to modulate traits linked to reproduction. As caterpillars are the primary food source required for insectivorous birds to raise offspring, their ability to locate and predict future peaks in caterpillar biomass using olfaction is likely to be advantageous. Therefore, we tested whether an insectivorous songbird that naturally inhabits oak dominated forests can be trained to detect early spring infestation by hatchling caterpillars, at a time when oaks begin bursting, and birds prepare to breed. Tree buds were either infested with caterpillars or left as a control and visually obscured in a Y-Maze choice test. Additionally, we measured testosterone and 17Î²-estradiol as they influence olfactory perception in mammals and are linked to reproduction in vertebrates. After being trained to associate the presence of HIPVs with that of food, blue tits spent more time with, were more active around, and more frequently chose to first visit the infested trees, showing that blue tits can smell caterpillar activity. Males with higher testosterone spent more time around infested trees, suggesting that foraging behavior during the pre-breeding season is linked with a major reproductive signal. There was no relationship between foraging and estradiol in females. These results are an important foundation for further investigation of the role of hormones in avian olfaction and how smell may be useful for making breeding decisions that could improve reproductive success.

In aquatic ecosystems, n-3 LCPUFAs are produced by phytoplankton and bioaccumulate in the food web. Alarmingly, the warming and acidification of aquatic systems caused by climate change impair n-3 LCPUFA production, with an anticipated decrease of 80% by the year 2100. We tested whether n-3 LCPUFA consumption affects the physiology, morphology, behaviour and cognition of the chicks of a top marine predator, the ring-billed gull. Using a colony with little access to n-3 LCPUFAs, we supplemented siblings from 22 fenced nests with contrasting treatments from hatching until fledging; one sibling received n-3 LCPUFA-rich fish oil and the other, a control sucrose solution without n-3 LCPUFAs. Halfway through the nestling period, half the chicks receiving fish oil were switched to the sucrose solution to test whether n-3 LCPUFA intake remains crucial past the main growth phase (chronic versus transient treatments). Upon fledging, n-3 LCPUFAs were elevated in the blood and brains of chicks receiving the chronic treatment, but were comparable to control levels among those receiving the transient treatment. Across the entire sample, chicks with elevated n-3 LCPUFAs in their tissues fledged earlier despite their morphology and activity levels being unrelated to fledging age. Fledging required chicks to escape fences encircling their nest. We therefore interpret fledging age as a possible indicator of cognition, with chicks with improved cognition fledging earlier. These results provide insight into whether declining dietary n-3 LCPUFAs will compromise top predators' problem-solving skills, and thus their ability to survive in a rapidly changing world.

They can have consistent differences in grazing patterns and occupy specific spatial domains, whilst developing tactics and strategies for foraging that are specific to their grazing personalities. In this review, we explore the development of our understanding of grazing personalities, as we move away from the search for an â€œoptimal animalâ€ toward designing behavior-customized herds with an arrangement of individual grazing personalities that enhance ecosystem services and productivity. We present a â€œgrazing personality modelâ€ that accounts for the personality of individual animals and for collective behaviors of herds. We argue that grazing personalities of grazing ruminants and other large herbivores are in part genetically determined, and that they can act at the individual and collective level. The social and biophysical environments as well as the emotional state of animals regulate the expression of â€œgrazing genesâ€ that are observed phenotypically as distinct grazing personalities. The reproductive and sexual successes of individuals and herds filter for allele variants of grazing genes and in turn determines their relative frequency. While the selection of one grazing personality may be adequate for homogeneous pastoral systems, the design of herds with a range of grazing personalities that are matched to the habitat diversity may be a better approach to improving the distribution of grazing animals, enhancing ecosystem services, and maximizing productivity.

We analyse age-related changes in the cellular constitutive immunity throughout nestling development, as well as its relationship with sex and brood size. We found that cellular constitutive immunity could be affected by age, sex, brood size, or daily rhythm. Early-stage nestlings relied more on cells of the innate immunity rather than on cells linked to the adaptive immune system. Cellular immunity may not be fully mature in fledglings, as reflected by differences in phagocytic cell counts with regard to adults. Beyond the age-dependent effects, agranulocyte cell counts were affected by sibling competition while granulocyte cell counts showed a daily rhythm. We also show that the heterophil to lymphocyte ratio was negatively related to body weight when nestlings become more independent.

We perform 3D live-cell imaging to show that Oo-Mvi exhibit cellular characteristics that fit an exocrine function for signaling communication. We find that deletion of the microvilli-forming gene Radixin in oocytes leads to the loss of Oo-Mvi in ovaries, and causes a series of abnormalities in ovarian development, resulting in shortened reproductive lifespan in females. Mechanistically, we find that Oo-Mvi enrich oocyte-secreted factors and control their release, resulting in optimal selection of ovarian follicles. Taken together, our data show that the Oo-Mvi system controls the female reproductive lifespan by governing the fate of follicles. Â© 2021, The Author(s).",

However, its consequences for the next generation remain largely unexplored. We manipulated the OS level endured by zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) duringtheir development by transitorily inhibiting the synthesis of the key antioxidant glutathione (â€œearly-high-OSâ€). The offspring of these birds and control parents were cross fostered at hatching to enlarge or reduce its brood size. Independent of parentsâ€™ early-life OS levels, the chicks raised in enlarged broods showed lower erythrocyte glutathione levels, revealing glutathione sensitivity to environmental conditions. Control biological mothers produced females, not males, that attained a higher body mass when raised in a benign environment (i.e., the reduced brood). In contrast, biological mothers exposed to early-life OS produced heavier males, not females, when allocated in reduced broods. Early-life OS also affected the parental rearing capacity because 12-day-old nestlings raised by a foster pair with both early-high-OS members grew shorter legs (tarsus) than chicks from other groups. The results indicate that environmental conditions during development can affect early glutathione levels, which may in turn influence the next generation through both pre-and postnatal parental effects. The results also demonstrate that earlylife OS can constrain the offspring phenotype. Â© 2020 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.",
Limatola2020,Oxygen supersaturation mitigates the impact of the regime of contaminated sediment reworking on sea urchin fertilization process,"Limatola, N. and Bertocci, I. and Chun, J.T. and Musco, L. and Munari, M. and Caramiello, D. and Danovaro, R. and Santella, L.",Marine Environmental Research,1411136,158,NA,NA,,,2020,Elsevier Ltd,,,10.1016/j.marenvres.2020.104951,"Dismissed industrial plants with chronic environmental contamination globally affect all levels of biological organization in concert with other natural and anthropogenic perturbations. Assessing the impact of such perturbations and finding effective ways to mitigate them have clear ecological and societal implications. Through indoor manipulative experiments, we assessed here the effects of the temporal regime of reworking of contaminated sediment from the Bagnoli-Coroglio brownfield (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy) on the fertilization process in Paracentrotus lividus. Adult sea urchins were kept for one month in tanks containing contaminated sediment that was re-suspended according to two temporal patterns of water turbulence differing in the time intervals between consecutive events of agitation (mimicking the storms naturally occurring in the study area) in seawater with natural vs. supersaturated oxygenation levels. At the end of the treatment, gametes were collected and used to test the hypothesis that the regime of contaminated sediment reworking negatively, but reversibly, affects morphological and physiological traits of the fertilized eggs. We found that aggregated events of sediment re-suspension had profound negative effects on gamete interactions and Ca2+ signaling at fertilization. The same experimental condition also inflicted marked ultrastructural changes in eggs. Importantly, however, such detrimental effects were inhibited by increased oxygenation. By contrast, the regime of sediment re-working with a longer interval between consecutive turbulent events had only marginal effects. Thus, the current and predicted changes of climate-related disturbance appear to modulate the biological effects of chronic contamination in post-industrial areas, suggesting that environmental rehabilitation via restoration of habitat-forming primary producers such as seagrasses or algal canopies could alleviate the pollutantsâ€™ effects on resident biota.

However, how these labor divisions are determined, whether they are simply intrinsic differences in the individualâ€™s behavior or a coordinated behavioral response by the pair, remains unknown. We used the monogamous, biparental and territorial California mouse (Peromyscus californicus) to study how behavioral approach to an aggressive vocal stimulus in a novel environment was affected by pair-bonding. Using a three-chambered vocal playback paradigm, we first measured the amount of time individuals spent in close proximity to aggressive bark vocalizations. We found that animals could be categorized as either approachers or avoiders. We then paired individuals based on their initial approach behavior to an opposite sex individual who displayed either similar or different approach behaviors. These pairs were then retested for approach behavior as a dyad 10â€“11 days post-pairing. This test found that pairs showed convergence in their behavioral responses, such that pairs who were mismatched in their approach behaviors became more similar, and pairs that were matched remained so. Finally, we analyzed the ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) produced and found that pairs produced significantly more USVs than individuals. Importantly, increased USV production correlated with increasing behavioral convergence of pairs. Taken together, this study shows that pair-bonded animals alter their approach behaviors to coordinate their response with their partner and that vocal communication may play a role in coordinating these behavioral responses. Overall, our findings indicate that pair-bonding generates an emergent property in pairs, adjusting their combined approach behavior towards a new aggressive stimulus representing a potential challenge to the bonded pair. Such findings may be broadly important for social bonding in other social systems. Â© 2021 Rieger et al.

Traditionally, group size has been used as a primary metric for quantifying the impact of social behaviour on parasite transmission; however, with the emergence of social network analysis an increasing number of studies are using this more nuanced tool to study links between social behaviour and parasite infection. In this study, we synthesized insights derived from empirical studies on social networks and parasites using a meta-analytical approach. We analysed 210 associations between parasite burden and individual level network metrics extracted from 18 published articles. Overall, we found a positive effect of social behaviour, measured by social network metrics, on parasite infection at the individual level, with no evidence of publication bias. The magnitude of the mean effect size for associations between social network metrics and measures of parasitism was nearly twice as large as that observed for group size in previous meta-analyses. However, there was significant heterogeneity in effect sizes across studies, and this pattern could not be explained by either host traits, parasite traits or the social network metric examined. We discuss potential reasons for this unexplained heterogeneity, such as possible mismatches between focal host social behaviour and focal parasite biology as well as methodological considerations. We also suggest future research directions that can help fill gaps that remain in our understanding of the drivers of variation in interactions between social hosts and parasites.

Here we examine how parental environment and juvenile experience jointly modify offspring phenotypes in the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata. Parents were reared in the laboratory either with or without predator cues, and offspring were split and reared either with or without predator cues. We found that parental effects led to smaller body size, an increase in whole-body cortisol and increases in activity and antipredator behaviour in open field and model predator assays. For most traits, both individual and parental experience with predators produced similar outcomes. For some traits, male and female offspring differed in consequences of parental and individual exposure to predator cues. Together, our results suggest that parental effects and offspring experience influence males and females differently, last into adulthood and highlight the complex interactions between intergenerational and developmental plasticity.

If the costs of reproduction are too high, animals should prioritize their own survival. During bad times, mobile animals may be able to compensate for local food shortages by travelling further to provision their offspring. But, whether inherent mobility alleviates individual fitness costs of this parental strategy is not known. We studied parental investment and breeding success of long-lived, nomadic, migratory swift parrots Lathamus discolor over two successive years at the same site where food abundance went from locally low to high. We hypothesize that in a bad year, swift parrots should adjust their parental strategy by foregoing breeding altogether, producing smaller clutches/broods or reducing provisioning investment. Fewer swift parrots bred locally when food was scarce. In the bad year, clutch and brood sizes were smaller and nestlings were >20Â g lighter (approximately 28% of mean body mass) than in the good year. Compared with the good year, fathers spent longer foraging, less time at the nest and travelled further during provisioning trips in the bad year. Although limited to only 2Â years, our results suggest that mobile species may attempt to mitigate the effects of a bad year on their reproductive success by rearing fewer offspring and investing more in provisioning behaviour, but this strategy may not necessarily compensate for environmental conditions.

Theory posits that parentsâ€™ interpretation and response to begging should vary with the likelihood of a return on their investment. We tested this in a wild population of prothonotary warblers (Protonotaria citrea), predicting that parents bias food non-randomly toward certain individuals within their broods depending on both the size and number of offspring. We observed parentâ€“offspring interactions and detected strong dependence between brood size and nestling size in shaping parental responses to begging. Larger siblings were less likely to solicit food during feeding events than their smaller siblings, but they received a disproportionate share from parents in nests containing fewer-than-average young, whereas the smaller-than-average nestlings were disproportionately fed in broods containing a greater-than-average number of young. These findings suggest that parents respond to begging signals according to multiple social cues, favoring the stronger siblings with greater survival prospects when few copies of their genes are present, but overtly favoring runts to ensure whole-brood survival when capable of fledging more young. Future experimental studies may shed light on the contributions of parental decision-making and memory, how young nestlings learn in parentâ€“offspring communication systems, and the adaptive significance of these behaviors.

Parents were fed either a control or methyl-enhanced (HiBET) diet, and their eggs were treated with a vehicle or corticosterone injection during day 5 of incubation. A subset of G1 birds were subjected to an open field trial (OFT) and capture-restraint stress protocol. Significant effects of HiBET diet were found on parental egg and liver weights, G1 hatch, liver and female reproductive tract weights, egg productivity, latency to leave the OFT central zone, male baseline 11-dehydrocorticosterone, and female androstenedione plasma concentrations. In ovo treatment significantly affected latency to return to the OFT, male baseline testosterone and androstenedione, and change in androstenedione plasma concentration. Diet by treatment interactions were significant for G1 liver weight and male baseline plasma concentrations of corticosterone. These novel findings suggest significant positive effects on reproduction, growth, precociousness, and hypothalamicâ€“pituitaryâ€“adrenal axis function from enhanced methyl diets, and are important in understanding how in ovo stressors (representing maternal stress), affect the first offspring generation.

In addition, we recorded the causes of mortality in egg clutches of this species. We quantified infestation by fly larvae and its impact on the survival of embryos. We found that the reproductive activity of N. grandisonae (number of males calling) was seasonal and occurred in months with highest precipitation. The main cause of embryo mortality in clutches was associated with the infestation by a spittlebug fly of the genus c.f. Cladochaeta (Drosophilidae). The survival of embryos in infested clutches was significantly lower than in those clutches not infested by fly larvae.

UV-induced carryover effects and potential adaptations to avoid or mitigate them are understudied in terrestrial animals, including arthropods and their potentially most vulnerable life stages. The spined soldier bug, Podisus maculiventris, increases the emergence of its eggs that are exposed to UV radiation by coating them in sunscreen-like pigmentation, but consequences of these conditions of embryonic development for nymphs and adults are unknown. We measured stink bug nymph survival, adult size and sex ratio following exposure of differently pigmented eggs across a range of UV intensities. Nymph survival to adulthood decreased with higher intensity of embryonic UV exposure and this carryover effect decreased with higher level of egg pigmentation, similar to previously observed effects on embryonic survival. Nymph development time, adult size and sex ratio were not affected by embryonic exposure to UV radiation nor by photoprotective egg pigmentation. This study is the first to demonstrate the potential for lethal carryover effects of UV radiation in terrestrial insects, highlighting the need for more studies of how this pervasive environmental stressor can affect fitness across life stages.

A total of one hundred twenty 56-week-old ISA-brown laying hens were continuously exposed to one of three temperature regimes: optimal (LT; 22 Â°C), moderate (MT; 27 Â°C), and high (HT; 32 Â°C). The relative humidity was maintained at 50% in all treatments. HT vs. MT and LT increased rectal temperature, heart rate, and body-surface temperature on all days (P < 0.05). HT vs. LT raised (P < 0.05) the H/L ratio in blood at day 42 following heat exposure. On the other hand, both HT- and MT-exposed laying hens had higher (P < 0.05) plasma CORT compared with those on LT group only at 28 and 42 d following heat treatment. Yolk CORT was elevated (P < 0.05) in the HT vs. MT and LT groups at 3 and 14 d following heat treatment. Panting and wing elevation were the most relevant behaviors in laying hens exposed to HT vs. MT and LT. The study shows that rectal and body-surface temperature, heart rate, and behavior, but not CORT or H/L ratio, are the reliable indicators for assessing the stress status of laying hens over extended period of heat stress.

Brood parasitism often imposes severe fitness costs on hosts, selecting for the evolution of effective antiparasitic defences, such as recognition and rejection of brood parasite eggs. Glucocorticoids have been recently found to mediate host physiological and behavioral adjustments in response to brood parasite eggs; however, it remains unclear whether brood parasitism triggers a general response involving multiple physiological elements. In this study, we experimentally investigated whether a salient brood parasitic stimulus (the presence of a nonmimetic model egg in the nest) causes physiological adjustments in adult Eurasian blackbirds (Turdus merula) at immune (leukocyte profiles) and cellular (heat-shock protein Hsp70 synthesis) level. Also, we explored whether these physiological changes are mediated by variations in corticosterone (CORT) levels. We found that experimental brood parasitism caused an increase in heterophils and a decrease in lymphocytes, leading to higher heterophils and lymphocytes ratios in parasitized birds. Nevertheless, we did not find tradeoffs between immune function and CORT levels. Hsp70 synthesis was not affected by our experimental manipulation. Our findings provide evidence that brood parasite eggs trigger a general stress response in egg-rejecter hosts, including changes in cellular immune profiles. Â© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",

We also considered characteristics of surrounding landscapes and the impacts of pollinator natural enemies. Our results indicated that pollinators responded positively to high plant species diversity, woody vegetation, garden size, and sun exposure and negatively to the separation of garden habitats from natural sites. Within-garden features more strongly influenced pollinators than surrounding landscape factors. Growing interest in gardening for pollinators highlights the need to better understand how gardens contribute to pollinator conservation and how some garden characteristics can enhance the attractiveness and usefulness of gardens to pollinators.

Many studies have shown that reproductive hormones are tightly linked to the breeding sub-stages. However, only a few studies have examined the temporal trend of hormone levels among different reproductive stages in multiple brooded species. We investigated the changes in plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and prolactin (PRL) concentrations during different reproductive stages of the facultative double-brooded Great Tit (Parus major). We found that the concentrations of LH and PRL in females were significantly higher than those in males. Females had significantly higher LH and lower PRL concentrations in the pre-breeding period than in the first/second brooding periods, and there were no significant changes between the first and second brooding periods. The concentrations of LH and PRL in males had no significant difference between the pre-breeding period and the first brooding periods, while LH and PRL concentrations in the second brooding period were significantly higher than those in the first brooding period. We conclude that there are sex-based differences between LH and PRL at different stages of reproduction. The changes in LH and PRL in both males and females should be related to their physiological functions. Especially for males, individuals with higher levels of LH and PRL are more likely to maintain second clutches. Â© 2022 The Authors",

Karger AG,,,10.1159/000515208,"The adaptive significance of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) remains elusive for many long-lived reptiles. Various hypotheses proposed potential ecological drivers of TSD. The Charnov-Bull'77 model remains the most robust and explains the maintenance of TSD in short-lived vertebrates, where sex ratios correlate with seasonal temperatures within years that confer sex-specific fitness (colder springs produce females who grow larger and gain in fecundity, whereas warmer summers produce males who mature at smaller size). Yet, evidence of fitness differentials correlated with incubation temperature is scarce for long-lived taxa. Here, it is proposed that the Charnov-Bull'77 model applies similarly to long-lived taxa, but at a longer temporal scale, by revisiting ecological and genetic data from the long-lived turtle Podocnemis expansa. After ruling out multiple alternatives, it is hypothesized that warmer-drier years overproduce females and correlate with optimal resource availability in the flood plains, benefitting daughters more than sons, whereas resources are scarcer (due to reduced flowering/fruiting) during colder-rainier years that overproduce males, whose fitness is less impacted by slower growth rates. New technical advances and collaborative interdisciplinary efforts are delineated that should facilitate testing this hypothesis directly, illuminating the understanding of TSD evolution in P. expansa and other long-lived TSD reptiles.

Favorable early life environment and high maternal investment are expected to improve survival and reproduction. For example, in mammals, maternal investment via lactation predicts offspring growth. As body mass is often associated with fitness consequences, females have the potential to influence offspring fitness through their level of investment, which might interact with effects of population density and temperature. Here, we investigate the relationship between house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) pup body mass at day 13 (used as approximation for weaning mass) and individual reproductive parameters, as well as longevity, under natural variation in population density and temperature (as approximation for season). Further, we assessed the extent to which mothers influence the body mass of their offspring until weaning. To do so, we analyzed life data of 384 house mice from a free-living wild commensal population that was not food limited. The motherâ€™s contribution accounted for 49% of the variance in pup body mass. Further, we found a complex effect of population density, temperature and maternal investment on life-history traits related to fitness: shorter longevity with increasing pup body mass at day 13, delayed first reproduction of heavier pups when raised at warmer temperatures, and increased lifetime reproductive success for heavier pups at high densities. Our study shows that the effects of maternal investment are not independent of the effects of the environment. It thus highlights the importance of considering ecological conditions in combination with maternal effects to unravel the complexity of pup body mass on fitness measures.

Yet little is known about contaminant levels in tropical seabird communities located in key biodiversity points. French Guiana is a hotspot of biodiversity and is one of the regions experiencing a rampant increase in mercury (Hg) contamination. This review has the objective to summarize the results of (i) previous work on Hg contamination in seabirds from French Guiana and (ii) already published work on other environmental contaminant sources as persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Furthermore, previous research on Grand ConnÃ©table island, a key breeding site for Caribbean seabirds, reported high blood Hg concentrations in several seabirds, reaching the threshold of possible health concern for some species, particularly for the magnificent frigatebird Fregata magnificens. Because frigatebirds are experiencing massive mortality events of chicks caused by a herpesvirus disease that first appeared in 2005, this review further discusses a potential synergistic or additive interaction between food availability and Hg exposure in determining the recurrent disease outbreaks, a topic that has been often neglected in the literature. Here, we (i) summarize already published results from several years of research on this topic and (ii) suggest a potential connection between the occurrence of infectious diseases and cumulative effects of environmental stressors in marine top predators including birds, which clearly deserves further investigations. We also highlight the lack of studies on other sources of local pollution rather than Hg, and the need to take into consideration the cumulative effects of stressors on the health status of organisms, rather than focus on individual stressors or specific contaminants.

Parental effects are a powerful mechanism to prepare offspring for coping with such environments, yet clear evidence for adaptive parental effects on offspring antipredator behaviors is missing. Rapid escape reflexes, or ""C-start reflexes,"" are a key adaptation in fish and amphibians to escape predator strikes. We hypothesized that mothers living in high-risk environments might induce faster C-start reflexes in offspring by modifying egg composition. Here, we show that offspring of the cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher developed faster C-start reflexes and were more risk averse if their parents had been exposed to cues of their most dangerous natural predator during egg production. This effect was mediated by differences in egg composition. Eggs of predator-exposed mothers were heavier with higher net protein content, and the resulting offspring were heavier and had lower igf-1 gene expression than control offspring shortly after hatching. Thus, changes in egg composition can relay multiple putative pathways by which mothers can influence adaptive antipredator behaviors such as faster escape reflexes.

Mature offspring did not differ in behaviour or stress responses compared with controls and so the effects of maternal predation stress did not appear to persist into adulthood. A different form of gestational stress, dietary restriction, did not significantly affect offspring growth, though brood size was reduced, suggesting that the effects of predation stress were not mediated by differences in resource demand or consumption.

The risk of IP among hens with intact beaks in cage-free housing prompts a need for solutions based on an understanding of underlying mechanisms. In this review, we explore how behavioural programming via prenatal and early postnatal environmental conditions could influence the development of IP in laying hens. The possible roles of early life adversity and mismatch between early life programming and subsequent environmental conditions are considered. We review the role of maternal stress, egg conditions, incubation settings (temperature, light, sound, odour) and chick brooding conditions on behavioural programming that could be linked to IP. Brain and behavioural development can be programmed by prenatal and postnatal environmental conditions, which if suboptimal could lead to a tendency to develop IP later in life, as we illustrate with a Jenga tower that could fall over if not built solidly. If so, steps taken to optimise the environmental conditions of previous generations and incubation conditions, reduce stress around hatching, and guide the early learning of chicks will aid in prevention of IP in commercial laying hen flocks.

Increases of egg androgen levels have often been shown to induce sex-specific effects. Some previous studies suggest that females specifically may suffer a fitness reduction after early exposure to high androgen levels. In this study, we explored whether female birds that developed exposed to high yolk androgen concentrations would reduce their maternal investment later in life. We explored two different aspects of female reproduction in spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor): egg coloration (a post mating sexual signal in this species) and egg size. We manipulated androgen yolk levels in a large sample of clutches of this species. We monitored the reproduction of the females that hatched from these eggs, measuring the size and colour of the eggs they laid throughout their life (from 1 to 7 years of age). We found no overall difference in egg colour in relation to treatment, clutch number or age. However, females exposed to high egg androgen levels showed a steeper decrease in egg size along the laying order than controls. This pattern likely results in a more unbalanced distribution of resources within the clutch, possibly favouring brood size reductions in experimental females. In addition, control and experimental females differed in how egg volume changed with age. These results show that some egg characteristics may be affected by the femaleâ€™sÂ exposure to yolk androgens during her own embryonic development. Our research calls for further long-term research on the influence of prenatal androgens on the fitness mechanisms regulating reproductive investment and its potential signalling role in a perspective of sexual selection. Significance statement: In birds, mothers prepare the offspring to the environment they will encounter at hatching by depositing a mixture of compounds into the eggs. Androgens specifically exert a variety of effects during embryo development and chick growth, but some of these may be negative in adult life. In particular, early androgen may be detrimental for females in the long term, decreasing maternal investment and fitness. Using the spotless starling as study species, we tested whether an experimental increase in yolk androgens negatively affects breeding investment, measured by egg colour (a sexual signal) and egg size. We found no effects of the treatment on egg colour. However, females exposed to high androgen levels during their development reduced egg size along the laying order more strongly than controls. This may affect nestling survival, and indicates that prenatal yolk androgens may influence some egg characteristics with known relevance for offspring viability.

Recent research suggested that PMS also induced epigenetic modifications. In the present study, we analysed, in the Japanese quail, the effects of PMS on the emotional reactivity and cognitive abilities of the F1 offspring. We also investigated in the hippocampus, the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus and subnuclei of the arcopallium/amygdala the level of two histone post-translational modifications, H3K4me2 and H3K27me3, known to be impacted by stress. We found that PMS does not affect F1 quail's learning abilities but increases their emotional reactivity. Moreover, we demonstrated that PMS induced an increased density of H3K27me3 positive cells, in the hippocampus, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus and dorsal nucleus of the amygdala, but not variations of H3K4me2. As these brain regions are involved in the control of vertebratesâ€™ emotional responses, the effect of PMS on the epigenetic mark H3K27me3 could possibly be a mechanism involved in the behavioural effects we observed in F1 quail.

Here, we experimentally elevated prenatal testosterone in the eggs of zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) and measured male aggression in adulthood along with patterns of neural gene expression (RNA-seq) and DNA methylation (MethylC-Seq) in two socially relevant brain regions (hypothalamus and nucleus taenia of the amygdala). We used enrichment analyses and protein-protein interaction networks to find candidate processes and hub genes potentially affected by the treatment. We additionally identified differentially expressed genes that contained differentially methylated regions. Results: We found that males from testosterone-injected eggs displayed more aggressive behaviors compared to males from control eggs. Hundreds of genes were differentially expressed, particularly in the hypothalamus, including potential aggression-related hub genes (e.g., brain derived neurotrophic factor). There were also enriched processes with well-established links to aggressive phenotypes (e.g., somatostatin and glutamate signaling). Furthermore, several highly connected genes identified in protein-protein interaction networks also showed differential methylation, including adenylate cyclase 2 and proprotein convertase 2. Conclusions: These results highlight genes and processes that may play an important role in mediating the effects of prenatal testosterone on long-term phenotypic outcomes, thereby providing insights into the molecular mechanisms that facilitate hormone-mediated maternal effects.

In birds, maternal egg corticosterone (CORT) is known to exert contrasting effects on offspring morphology, physiology and behaviour after hatching. However, information on the effects of CORT exposure on pre-hatching embryonic development is limited. We experimentally increased yolk CORT levels in yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) eggs, and assessed the effects on embryo pre-hatching development and oxidative status of brain and liver. CORT-supplemented embryos reached a larger skeletal size and liver mass compared with controls. Embryos from CORT-injected last-laid eggs showed decreased activity of the hepatic antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase, while intermediate-laid eggs showed increased levels of lipid peroxidation. However, elevated yolk CORT did not affect oxidative stress endpoints in the brain. Our results indicate that elevated yolk CORT levels affect prenatal embryo development by promoting skeletal growth, and induce laying sequence- and organ-specific oxidative imbalance, with potential adverse consequences during postnatal life, especially for late-hatched offspring.

In vertebrates, prolactin and corticosterone are two important hormones that regulate parental investment because they stimulate parental care and mobilize energy, respectively. Further, concentrations of both hormones change in response to disturbances. One of the most important parental care behaviors in birds is incubation, since small changes in egg temperature have large effects on offspring. We investigated how prolactin and corticosterone may mediate parental incubation constancy (i.e., the daily amount of time spent incubating eggs) and regulation of egg temperature. We collected blood samples from female wood ducks (Aix sponsa) near the start and end of the incubation period to measure baseline and stress-induced (30 min after capture and restraint) hormone concentrations. We also quantified incubation constancy and egg temperature using artificial egg temperature loggers. As expected, prolactin decreased and corticosterone increased after 30 min of capture and restraint. Corticosterone concentrations (baseline and stress-induced) were negatively related to body mass, but were not related to incubation constancy. In contrast, prolactin concentrations (baseline and stress-induced) were higher at the end than the start of the incubation period, and stress-induced prolactin concentrations were positively related to incubation constancy following a nest disturbance (i.e., capture). Further, prolactin (baseline and stress-induced) concentrations were positively related to egg temperatures, but only after the disturbance. These results suggest that prolactin may be associated with the regulation of parental incubation constancy and resulting heat-transfer after a disturbance, which may ultimately affect offspring development.

Prolactin, one of the main hormones involved in the regulation of avian parental behaviour, might play a key role in the orchestration of the host responses to avian brood parasitism. Given the positive association between prolactin and parental behaviour during incubation, decreasing prolactin levels are expected to facilitate egg-rejection decisions. We tested this prediction by implanting Eurasian blackbird (Turdus merula) females with an inhibitor of prolactin secretion, bromocriptine mesylate, to experimentally decrease their plasma prolactin levels. Bromocriptine mesylate-implanted individuals ejected mimetic model eggs at higher rates, and showed shorter latency to egg ejection, than placebo-treated birds. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence that behavioural host defences against avian brood parasitism are mediated by prolactin. Â© 2021 Company of Biologists Ltd.

Given the importance of successful reproduction for population recruitment, investigating reproductive impairment is essential, even more so for animals with low reproductive rates such as chondrichthyans. However, data for these species are lacking, even though the poor conservation status of many chondrichthyan populations and the threats from overexploitation and discard require a better understanding of fishing-capture stress consequences. In this study, we investigated the reproductive consequences of trawling and air exposure stress when experienced by southern fiddler rays (Trygonorrhina dumerilii) during late pregnancy, with a focus on neonatal traits. Compared with neonates from unstressed mothers, neonates born from mothers subjected to capture simulation had significantly lower body mass and yolk sac volume at birth, showed a granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio indicative of a stressed condition, reduced growth, altered burying behavior, reduced boldness, and swam for shorter distances after a simulated predator attack. Smaller size and lower growth rate might expose neonates to a higher rate of predation, and similarly, the altered burying and swimming behaviors may reduce their ability to escape from predators. Decreased boldness could impact neonate survival by reducing their ability to compete and obtain food and resources. Further investigations are needed, but these initial results suggest that capture stress suffered by pregnant rays may alter traits and survival of their offspring with consequences for recruitment and population abundance.

Hence, we clearly require comprehensive reviews that attempt to find overarching patterns and establish possible causes for these variable results.

Pathogenic infections in the mucosal tissues of laying hens lead to worsened health of the host animal, decreased egg production, and bacterial contamination of eggs. Therefore, better understanding of the mechanisms underlying mucosal barrier function is needed to prevent infection by pathogens. In addition, pathogen infection in the mucosal tissue generally causes mucosal inflammation. Recently, it has been shown that inflammation in the oviduct and intestinal tissue caused by disruption of the mucosal barrier function, can affect egg production. Therefore, it is vitla to understand the relationship between mucosal barrier function and egg production to improve poultry egg production.

Genetic effects and microhabitat stream conditions at female selected oviposition sites influence larval phenotypes. However, limited work has examined contributions of both factors across sequential ontogenetic stages for larvae of wild origin. Using a wild population of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) from Black Lake, Michigan (USA), fertilized eggs were collected from stream substrate just prior to hatch at one-meter intervals along seven transect lines at an adult-selected spawning area. Microhabitat variables (depth, discharge, substrate size) were recorded at egg collection points. Body length, body area, and yolk-sac area were quantified for yolk-sac larvae (NÂ = 359) at the time of hatch. Following the onset of exogenous feeding, larval growth was measured weekly for four weeks. Parentage was assigned using genetic-based analysis. Inter-individual variation in phenotypic traits quantified at hatch were attributed to stream microhabitat variables; mean depth had the largest influence. No additive genetic effects were detected at hatch. Post-emergence larval growth significantly varied within and among half-sibling groups with the greatest range in body size observed at 33Â days post-hatch. Additive genetic variance and heritability increased with age. Results demonstrate that female-selected incubation habitats influenced traits at hatch for wild-origin fish, but effects do not persist to a sequential ontogenetic stage. Alternatively, growth after the onset of exogenous feeding was largely influenced by intrinsic (genetic) factors which must be considered when designing and implementing rehabilitation strategies for lake sturgeon and potentially other threatened riverine fishes.

Reproductive strategies thus result in distinct cost-benefit syndromes across the life course that may shape individual health and aging trajectories. Here we used an artificial selection approach in Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) to test how reproductive strategies affect telomere length, a biomarker of somatic state, at different life stages. We show that males but not females from lines selected for low maternal investment (i.e., developing in a relatively small egg) had shorter telomeres at birth. These patterns were still weakly present at the end of the juvenile growth period. In contrast, significantly shorter telomeres were found in reproductively active adult birds from the high-investment lines, suggesting that telomere attrition was accelerated in these individuals once they had become reproductively active. Our study shows that reproductive strategies differentially affect telomere dynamics across the life course, highlighting the role of cross-generational constraints in shaping individual aging trajectories.

While research on embryonic upper thermal limits is extensive, sea turtle hatchling thermal tolerance has received less attention and our understanding of how incubation conditions influence hatchling thermal tolerance is limited. Here, we report green turtle Chelonia mydas hatchling hydration and thermal tolerance following incubation in dry and wet conditions. We used packed cell volume and total protein as indicators of hydration and measured the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) of hatchlings in air. Neither hydration nor thermal tolerance was directly influenced by moisture treatment. However, hatchlings from moister nests had longer incubation durations (wet: 60.11 d vs. dry: 54.86 d), and, using incubation duration as a proxy for incubation temperature, hatchlings from cooler nests had significantly lower CTmax (wet: 39.84Â°C vs. dry: 40.51Â°C). Thus, despite not directly influencing thermal tolerance, moisture treatment influenced nest temperature indirectly; hatchlings that experienced warmer conditions in dry nests had a higher thermal tolerance than hatchlings from cooler and wetter nests. Ectothermic neonates may have greater plasticity in their thermal tolerance than previously thought, but their ability to adapt to increasing temperature is likely limited. Additionally, common management techniques to reduce nest temperatures, such as watering and shading nests, may only reduce embryonic mortality at the cost of decreased hatchling thermal tolerance and increased hatchling mortality during emergence. Nesting-site management interventions designed to reduce embryonic mortality will need to consider mitigation of the possible effects of those interventions on hatchling mortality.

The exposure of embryos to a set of sex hormones and the mutual relations between those hormones cause the emergence of individual morphological and/or behavioural characteristics as well as differences between sexes. We have thus hypothesised that differences in one of these morphological traitsâ€”digit ratioâ€”may be a proxy representing a tendency towards tail autotomy. The aim of this study is to investigate the digit ratio (2D:3D, 2D:4D, 3D:4D) of the sand lizard, Lacerta agilis, Lacertidae, a species characterised by well-developed sexual dimorphism, whereby females are larger than males. We also tested associations between patterns in digit ratio and caudal autotomy, a common defensive mechanism among lizards. To our knowledge, the relationship between a tendency towards autotomy and digit ratio pattern has never been researched. To date, studies on autotomy have mainly focused on the consequences, costs or evolutionary background of tail loss. Hence, researchers examined mostly the frequency of autotomy in the context of predatory pressure or habitat conditions, omitting an individual's behavioural tendency to shed its tail. However, behavioural traits can affect an individual's exposure to predator attack and consequently the need to use an anti-predator strategy. Thus, following this logic, dropping the tail may be the result of the lizard's intraspecific personality characteristics, resulting from the effect of hormones on behaviour or innate traits. Therefore, we suggest that the inclusion of autotomy as a factor explaining observed digit ratio patterns and their variability between taxa has great potential. We used computerised measurements of photographed limbs to determine the length of digits. We found that the digit ratios for all four limbs were significantly lower in females than in males, excluding the 3D:4D ratio for the right hindlimbs. Therefore, the results confirmed the pattern already observed for most lizards. The novel element in our study is the detection of the relationship between a tendency towards caudal autotomy and digit ratio. Individuals with a tendency towards autotomy have a higher 2D:4D ratio in the right forelimbs and a lower 2D:3D ratio in the right hindlimbs. Obtained results suggest that these morphological characteristics are most likely related to intraspecific differences (between bold and shy individuals) which consequently may determine an individual's reaction or susceptibility to be a prey and escape behaviour. Thus, our results are probably the first attempt to link digit ratio to the susceptibility of lizards to tail autotomy. Â© 2020 Anatomical Society",

The systematic changes of yolk hormone concentrations within asynchronously hatching clutches have been interpreted as a means to adaptively shape the offspring's phenotype. However, in synchronously hatching clutches the role of yolk hormones is less understood. We investigated whether seasonal changes between eggs in the yolk hormones testosterone (Testo), progesterone (Prog) and corticosterone (Cort) also occur in the grey partridge, a synchronously hatching precocial species without direct food competition between siblings. Specifically we asked whether yolk hormone concentrations systematically vary with season and whether they affect the offspring's hatching mass, mass gain, circulating baseline and stress-induced Cort. Additionally, we investigated the effect of genetic background and food availability on yolk hormone concentrations by subjecting grey partridge hens of two strains (wild and domesticated) to two different feeding regimes (predictable vs. unpredictable feeding) during egg laying. We hypothesized that egg hormone concentrations change over the season, but breeding in captivity over many generations and ad libitum food access could have resulted in domestication effects which abolished potential seasonal effects. Results showed that progressing season had a strong positive effect on yolk Prog and yolk Testo, but not on yolk Cort. Feeding regimes and strain had no effect on yolk hormones. Offspring mass and mass gain increased and baseline Cort decreased with progressing season. In addition, yolk Testo correlated positively with offspring mass gain and negatively with baseline Cort, while yolk Prog had a positive correlation with baseline Cort. Strain and feeding regimes of the mother had no effect on offspring traits. In conclusion, grey partridge chicks hatching late in the season might benefit from the increased concentrations of the growth-stimulating yolk Testo and by this catch-up in development. Hence, yolk hormone concentration could adaptively shape the offspring phenotype in a precocial species.",

Interestingly, this high degree of territoriality persists during the non-breeding season, despite low levels of circulating gonadal steroids (ie, testosterone [T] and oestradiol [E2]). Our previous work suggests that the pineal hormone melatonin mediates a â€˜seasonal switchâ€™ from gonadal to adrenal regulation of aggression in Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus); solitary, seasonally breeding mammals that display increased aggression during the short, â€˜winter-likeâ€™ days (SDs) of the non-breeding season. To test the hypothesis that melatonin elevates non-breeding aggression by increasing circulating and neural steroid metabolism, we housed female hamsters in long days (LDs) or SDs, administered them timed or mis-timed melatonin injections (mimic or do not mimic a SD-like signal, respectively), and measured aggression, circulating hormone profiles and aromatase (ARO) immunoreactivity in brain regions associated with aggressive or reproductive behaviours (paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus [PVN], periaqueductal gray [PAG] and ventral tegmental area [VTA]). Females that were responsive to SD photoperiods (SD-R) and LD females given timed melatonin injections (Mel-T) exhibited gonadal regression and reduced circulating E2, but increased aggression and circulating dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Furthermore, aggressive challenges differentially altered circulating hormone profiles across seasonal phenotypes; reproductively inactive females (ie, SD-R and Mel-T females) reduced circulating DHEA and T, but increased E2 after an aggressive interaction, whereas reproductively active females (ie, LD females, SD non-responder females and LD females given mis-timed melatonin injections) solely increased circulating E2. Although no differences in neural ARO abundance were observed, LD and SD-R females showed distinct associations between ARO cell density and aggressive behaviour in the PVN, PAG and VTA. Taken together, these results suggest that melatonin increases non-breeding aggression by elevating circulating steroid metabolism after an aggressive encounter and by regulating behaviourally relevant neural circuits in a region-specific manner.

A recent theoretical model suggests that differential allocation may influence trade-offs between reproductive traits within a breeding attempt. Furthermore, it is often difficult to distinguish differential allocation from direct effects of male condition. We address these gaps using a novel cross-fostering design to exclude direct effects of male condition and to test whether differential allocation affects trade-offs between and within breeding attempts. This design detects differential allocation as effects of a female's mating partner and direct effects of male condition as effects of the larvae's sire. We used the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides, a species which adjusts reproductive allocation by culling some larvae after hatching. We used food deprivation to manipulate the nutritional condition of both the female's mating partner and the larvae's sire. We find clear evidence for differential allocation as females mating with food-deprived males had fewer larvae than females mating with control males. There was a trade-off between number and size of larvae when females mated with control males, but a positive relationship when females mated with food-deprived males. Thus, differential allocation influenced relationships between reproductive traits within a breeding attempt, but not necessarily through trade-offs. Instead, we suggest that there may be cryptic heterogeneity in quality among females or their mating partners that was only exposed when females mated with a male in poor condition.

Exposing 5 days post-fertilization (dpf) larvae to 10% dissolved O2 (DO) for 16 h only marginally reduced survival, but it decreased forebrain neural proliferation by 55%, and reduced the expression of neurod1, gfap and mbpa, markers of determined neurons, glia and oligodendrocytes, respectively. The 5 dpf hypoxic exposure also elicited transient increases in wholebody cortisol and in crf, uts1 and hsd20b2 expression, key regulators of the endocrine stress response. Hypoxia exposure at 5 dpf also inhibited the cortisol stress response to hypoxia in 10 dpf larvae and increased hypoxia tolerance. However, 10% DO exposure at 5 dpf for 16 h did not affect the cortisol stress response to a novel stressor in 10 dpf larvae or the cortisol stress response to hypoxia in adult fish. Therefore, while larval exposure to severe hypoxia can inhibit brain development, it also increases hypoxia tolerance. These effects may transiently reduce the impact of hypoxia on the cortisol stress response but not its functional capacity to respond to novel stressors. We conclude that the larval cortisol stress response in zebrafish has a high capacity to cope with severe hypoxia-induced neurogenic impairment. Â© 2022. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

Prey may respond differently to predation risk based on key traits such as sex, but the influence of sex-specific variation is typically explored in species with strong sexual dimorphism. However, sex-specific responses to predation risk may arise even in prey species lacking sexual dimorphisms based on differences in the relative cost of reproduction. Using a rocky intertidal food chain, we conducted a laboratory mesocosm experiment to explore sex-specific responses of morphologically similar, reproductively mature prey (the snail Nucella lapillus) to predation risk and whether risk affected female fecundity. We found that predation risk suppressed prey growth only in males via effects on growth efficiency, suggesting that sex-specific disparities may arise due to differences in the energy required for reproduction and/or the costs of mounting a physiological stress response. Moreover, while risk did not affect overall female fecundity, it eliminated the positive relationship between female size and fecundity observed in the absence of risk. We hypothesize that these sex-specific disparities arise due to differences in the energy required for reproduction and/or the costs of mounting a physiological stress response. Reproduction is likely more energetically costly for females than males, so females may display weaker antipredator responses in order to maintain energetic reserves needed for reproduction. Our results suggest that sex-specific responses may be an important component of inter-individual differences in prey responses to risk and influence prey population growth and demography even in species lacking sexual dimorphism.

In house wrens (Troglodytes aedon), this effect of hatching order is especially evident in asynchronously hatched broods and can lead to sex-specific differences in the size and condition of nestlings. Females appear to allocate the sex of their offspring across the laying order to capitalize on these differences. We hypothesized that levels of circulating corticosterone, the primary metabolic hormone in birds, mediates these sex-specific effects in nestlings. We predicted that: i) baseline levels of corticosterone in nestlings should vary along the hatching order, ii) effects of hatching order on baseline corticosterone should be sex specific, and iii) any sex-specificity of hatching order on baseline corticosterone could be contingent on the degree of hatching synchrony. We tested these predictions in a study in which we measured baseline corticosterone in first- and last-hatched nestlings in synchronously and asynchronously hatching broods. To assess whether any differences in nestling baseline corticosterone levels could be attributed to pre-natal maternal effects, the post-natal environment, or both, we conducted two additional studies in which we measured i) yolk corticosterone in first- and last-laid eggs and ii) baseline corticosterone in nestlings that were cross-fostered to create simulated `asynchronously' hatched broods. There was a significant interaction between sex and relative hatching order in their effects on nestling baseline corticosterone, but no effect of hatching synchrony. Corticosterone levels remained relatively constant across the hatching order in males but decreased in females. There was a significant effect of laying order on yolk corticosterone, with first-laid eggs containing significantly higher levels of yolk corticosterone than last-laid eggs. Cross-fostering of nestlings at different points of development had no significant effect on nestling corticosterone levels. These results indicate that sexdependent differences in corticosterone levels across the hatching order may arise, at least in part, from embryonic exposure to maternally derived corticosterone, whereas the post-natal rearing environment plays, at best, a minimal role in determining nestling baseline corticosterone levels.",

However, the roles of offspring sex-specific sensitivity to maternal glucocorticoids and sex-biased maternal investment remain unclear. It is also uncertain whether telomere length (a marker associated with lifespan) depends on early growth in a sex-specific manner. We assessed whether maternal traits including corticosterone (CORT; the main avian glucocorticoid) and in ovo growth rate are sex-specifically related to offspring CORT exposure, relative telomere length (RTL) and body condition in eiders (Somateria mollissima). We measured feather CORT (fCORT), RTL and body condition of newly hatched ducklings, and growth rate in ovo was expressed as tarsus length at hatching per incubation duration. Maternal traits included baseline plasma CORT, RTL, body condition and breeding experience. We found that fCORT was negatively associated with growth rate in daughters, while it showed a positive association in sons. Lower offspring fCORT was associated with higher maternal baseline plasma CORT, and fCORT was higher in larger clutches and in those hatching later. The RTL of daughters was negatively associated with maternal RTL, whereas that of males was nearly independent of maternal RTL. Higher fCORT in ovo was associated with longer RTL at hatching in both sexes. Duckling body condition was mainly explained by egg weight, and sons had a slightly lower body condition. Our correlational results suggest that maternal effects may have heterogeneous and even diametrically opposed effects between the sexes during early development. Our findings also challenge the view that prenatal CORT exposure is invariably associated with shorter telomeres. Â© 2019, The Author(s).",

However, studies report inconsistencies in the direction of this association, with either positive, quadratic or no association being described. These discrepancies may arise because the fitness costs and benefits of MHC diversity differ among individuals depending on their exposure and immune responses to parasites. Here, we investigated in black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) chicks whether associations between MHC class-II diversity and fitness vary with sex and hatching order. MHC-II diversity was positively associated with growth and tick clearance in female chicks, but not in male chicks. Our data also revealed a positive association between MHC-II diversity and survival in second-hatched female chicks (two eggs being the typical clutch size). These findings may result from condition-dependent parasite infections differentially impacting sexes in relation to hatching order. We thus suggest that it may be important to account for individual heterogeneities in traits that potentially exert selective pressures on MHC diversity in order to properly predict MHCâ€“fitness associations.

Inmany reptiles, for example, egg incubation temperature permanently determines offspring sex (temperature-dependent sex determination, TSD) and also influences a suite of morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits. Thus, the contributions of sex and incubation temperature to phenotypic variation are difficult to identify because these factors are confounded under TSD. We used chemical manipulations to experimentally decouple gonadal sex and incubation temperature in a turtle with TSD (Chrysemys picta) to examine their relative and interactive effects on variation in incubation duration and offspring size. We show that warm incubation temperature accelerates development as expected and that exogenous estradiol treatment to eggs further shortens incubation duration across all incubation temperatures. Moreover, estradiol unexpectedly induced male development, resulting in male offspring hatching sooner than female offspring. Variation in offspring size was also influenced by incubation temperature and gonadal sex, but interactions between these two variables were relatively small or nonsignificant. The fitness consequences of these effects are unknown, but we provide preliminary results from our attempts at examining the long-term and sex-specific effects of incubation temperature. Manipulative experimental approaches, combined with longer-term experiments that track individuals through reproduction, will provide novel insights into the adaptive significance of developmental plasticity in long-lived organisms.

Comparative genetic studies using embryos of Darwin's finches have shed light on the possible evolutionary processes underlying the speciation of this clade. Molecular identification of the sex of embryonic samples is important for such studies, where this information often cannot be inferred otherwise. We tested a fast and simple chicken embryo protocol to extract DNA from Darwin's finch embryos. In addition, we applied minor modifications to two of the previously reported PCR primer sets for CHD1, a gene used for sexing adult passerine birds. The sex of all 29 tested embryos of six species of Darwin's finches was determined successfully by PCR, using both primer sets. Next to embryos, hatchlings and fledglings are also impossible to distinguish visually. This extends to juveniles of sexually dimorphic species which are yet to moult in adult-like plumage and beak colouration. Furthermore, four species of Darwin's finches are monomorphic, males and females looking alike. Therefore, sex assessment in the field can be a source of error, especially with respect to juveniles and mature monomorphic birds outside of the mating season. We caught 567 juveniles and adults belonging to six species of Darwin's finches and only 44% had unambiguous sex-specific morphology. We sexed 363 birds by PCR: individuals sexed based on marginal sex specific morphological traits; and birds which were impossible to classify in the field. PCR revealed that for birds with marginal sex specific traits, sexing in the field produced a 13% error rate. This demonstrates that PCR based sexing can improve field studies on Darwin's finches, especially when individuals with unclear sex-related morphology are involved. The protocols used here provide an easy and reliable way to sex Darwin's finches throughout ontogeny, from embryos to adults. Â© 2021 Dobreva et al.

Past tests of this hypothesis have focused on how natural variation in weather, food availability, or predation pressure shapes sex allocation trade-offs. However, anthropogenic activities, such as urbanization, can alter all of the above characteristics presenting animals with novel challenges in optimizing their brood sex ratio. Previous research has examined how urban living influences individual body condition in several bird taxa, but few have explored subsequent impacts on secondary offspring sex ratio. One likely mediator of the link between environmental conditions, parental condition, and sex ratios is corticosterone (CORT), the primary glucocorticoid in birds. Research on CORTâ€™s influence on sex ratios has focused solely on maternal CORT. However, for species with biparental care, paternal CORT or the similarity of maternal and paternal phenotypes may also help ensure that offspring demand matches parental care quality. To test these hypotheses, we explore offspring secondary sex ratios in European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). We did not find an effect of site or parental body condition on the production of the more costly sex (males). Instead, we found preliminary evidence suggesting that the similarity of maternal and paternal CORT levels within a breeding pair may increase the likelihood of successfully fledging sons. Maternal and paternal CORT were not significant predictors of secondary sex ratio, suggesting that parental similarity, rather than parental CORT alone, could play a role in shaping secondary offspring sex ratios, but additional work is needed to support this pattern. Starlings are considered an urban-adapted species, making them a compelling model for future studies of the relationship between urbanization, parental body condition, and sex ratios.

Typically, macro-evolutionary studies have been conducted without assessingÂ how deviations from an equal sex ratio could be explained by sex-biased mortality or dispersal. Our understanding of sex ratio evolution independent of these confounds, in addition toÂ any putative links between skewed sex ratios and other factors (e.g. life history), therefore remains largely unexplored. Here, we conducted an exploratory study investigating differences in sex ratios across closely related species while controlling for extrinsic mortality. We also tested two factors, non-overlapping/overlapping generations and the social environment, which have both been hypothesised to affect sex ratios. Specifically, we raised 15 species of killifish, which have either overlapping or discrete generations, under both solitary and social treatments. We found substantial divergences in sex ratios across closely related species, which exhibited both male and female biases. In conjunction with a low phylogenetic signal, our results suggest that sex ratios can evolve rapidly in this group. However, we found no evidence that overlapping generations or the social environment affected sex biases, suggesting that other factors drive the rapid evolution of sex ratios in killifishes.

These hormones include steroids, such as estradiol-17Î² (E2), testosterone (T), 11-ketotestosterone (11-kt), 17Î±,20ÃŸ-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (DHP), and cortisol, which also play an important role in fish reproduction. In European eel, Anguilla anguilla, which does not reproduce naturally in captivity, vitellogenesis in female broodstock is commonly induced by administration of salmon or carp pituitary extract (PE) as an exogenous source of gonadotropins, while follicular maturation is stimulated by a priming dose of PE followed by provision of DHP as a maturation inducing hormone. In this regard, the main purpose of the present study was to evaluate effects of induced follicular maturation on reproductive success in European eel, focusing on maternal transfer and dynamics of steroids and mRNA transcripts of growth- and development-related genes throughout embryogenesis. The results showed that maternal blood plasma concentrations of E2, T and DHP were reflected in the unfertilized eggs. Moreover, a negative relationship between concentrations of E2 and DHP in eggs and embryos and quality parameters measured as fertilization success, cleavage abnormalities, embryonic survival, and hatch success was found. Concomitant mRNA transcript abundance analysis including genes involved in stress response (hsp70, hsp90), somatotropic axis (gh, igf1, igf2a, igf2b), lipid (cpt1a, cpt1b, pigf5) and thyroid metabolism (dio1, dio2, dio3, thrÎ±b, thrÎ²a, thrÎ²b) varied among unfertilized egg batches. For the majority of genes, mRNA abundance increased during the maternal-to-zygotic transition in connection to activation of the transcription of the embryos own genome. mRNA abundance of dio1, cpt1a and cpt1b throughout embryogenesis was related to embryonic developmental competence. Notably, mRNA abundance of dio3 was positively associated with E2 concentrations, while the mRNA abundance of thrÎ±b was negatively related to T concentrations in the unfertilized eggs, which may suggest an interaction between the thyroid and steroid hormone systems. Altogether, maternal plasma concentrations of E2 and DHP were reflected in the eggs, with high concentrations of these steroids in the eggs being negatively associated with embryonic developmental competence. Additionally, high transcript levels of two of the investigated genes (dio1, cpt1b) were positively associated with embryonic developmental competence. This study reveals maternal transfer of steroids and mRNA transcripts to the eggs, which may be significant contributors to the variability in embryonic survival observed in European eel captive reproduction.

Despite being ubiquitous in most species, knowledge about floaters is scarce. Ignoring this significant number of individuals may strongly bias our understanding of population dynamics and sexual selection processes. We used the spotless starling (Sturnus unicolor) to examine whether phenotypical and non-phenotypical variables from early and adult life predict reproductive status, focusing on the earliest age at which most individuals start to breed, when the percentage of floaters is the highest. We compiled data from a long-term study involving eight female and seven male cohorts of individuals PIT-tagged at birth. We compared a suite of nestling (condition, hatching date and brood size) and adult variables (condition, size and ornamentation) between floaters and breeders. We found that adult and nestling body condition strongly and positively influenced the likelihood of breeding in males. Path analysis revealed that male reproductive status could only be predicted by considering nestling body conditionâ€”the influence of this variable superseded adult body condition. Female reproductive status was only negatively associated with hatching date. Ornamentation was not associated with reproductive status in any of the sexes, although path analyses revealed that body condition was positively associated with throat feather length. We conclude that predictors of reproductive status are sex-specific in the spotless starling, suggesting an important role of body condition in access to breeding resources in males. Our results also highlight the long-term influence of early life on life trajectories and their potential implications on floating status. Â© 2022, The Author(s).",

The struggle over mating and fertilization is a powerful driver of diversification within and among species. Contemporaries dismissed Darwin's conjecture of a â€œtaste for the beautifulâ€ as favoring particular mates over others, but there is now overwhelming evidence for a primary role of both male and female mate choice in sexual selection. Darwin's misogyny precluded much analysis of the â€œtasteâ€; an increasing focus on mate choice mechanisms before, during, and after mating reveals that these often evolve in response to selection pressures that have little to do with sexual selection on chosen traits. Where traits and preferences do coevolve, they can do so whether fitness effects on choosers are positive, neutral, or negative. The spectrum of selection on traits and preferences, and how traits and preferences respond to social effects, determine how sexual selection and mate choice influence broader-scale processes like reproductive isolation and population responses to environmental change.

Alternatively, individuals raised in high-quality environments can overinvest in early-reproduction resulting in rapid ageing. Here we use a long-term experimental manipulation of early-life conditions in a natural population of collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis), to show that females raised in a low-competition environment (artificially reduced broods) have higher early-life reproduction but lower late-life reproduction than females raised in high-competition environment (artificially increased broods). Reproductive success of high-competition females peaked in late-life, when low-competition females were already in steep reproductive decline and suffered from a higher mortality rate. Our results demonstrate that â€˜silver-spoonâ€™ natal conditions increase female early-life performance at the cost of faster reproductive ageing and increased late-life mortality. These findings demonstrate experimentally that natal environment shapes individual variation in reproductive and actuarial ageing in nature. Â© 2020 The Authors.

Yet, there are still unknown effects on the fish being subjected to the process of catch and release. Capture too close to spawning could have adverse effects on fish, and such data are important for setting appropriate closed seasons. This study examines how stressors related to catch and release experienced shortly before spawning affects adult mortality, vulnerability to Saprolegnia spp., and reproductive traits. Adult salmon were collected from the river Blackwater, Scotland, towards the end of their migration and were exposed to one of four protocols comprising exercise and air exposure of different durations. The experimental stressors increased the growth rate of the fungus Saprolegnia spp. over the body of the fish. Moreover, male salmon from the most disturbed group exhibited an increase in the maximum duration of their sperm motility. Lastly, females that experienced exercise and (or) air exposure spawned at the usual time but with fewer eggs. These suggest that there may be benefits from preventing angling close to the time of spawning. Â© 2022, Canadian Science Publishing. All rights reserved.",

Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) is an agent that disrupts the intestinal environment. Previously, we reported that the oral administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS: 0.9 g/kg BW) for 5 days caused severe intestinal inflammation in laying hens. However, the DSS concentration in the previous study was much higher to induce a milder disruption of the intestinal environment without heavy symptoms. Thus, the goal of this study was to determine the effects of a lower dose of DSS on the intestinal environment and egg production in laying hens. White Leghorn laying hens (330-day old) were oral administered with or without 0.225 g DSS/kg BW for 28 days (DSS and control group: n = 7 and 8, respectively). Weekly we collected all laid eggs and blood plasma samples. Intestinal tissues, liver, ovarian follicles, and the anterior pituitary gland were collected 1 day after the final treatment. Lower concentrations of orally administered DSS caused (1) a decrease in the ratio of villus height/crypt depth, occludin gene expressions in large intestine and cecal microbiota diversity, (2) a decrease in egg yolk weight, (3) an increase in VLDLy in blood plasma, (4), and enhanced the egg yolk precursor accumulation in the gene expression pattern in the follicular granulosa layer, (5) an increase in FSH and IL-1Î² gene expression in the pituitary gland, and (6) an increase in concentration of plasma lipopolysaccharide binding protein. These results suggested that the administration of the lower concentration of DSS caused a slight disruption in the intestinal environment. This disruption included poor intestinal morphology and decreased cecal microbiome diversity. The change in the intestinal environment decreases egg yolk size without decreasing the VLDLy supply from the liver. The decrease in egg yolk size is likely to be caused by the dysfunction of egg-yolk precursor uptake in ovarian follicles. In conclusion, the oral administration of a lower dose of DSS is an useful method to cause slight disruptions of intestinal environment, and the intestinal condition decreases egg yolk size through disfunction of ovarian follicle.

Broiler breeders (36 wk, 3.56 Â± 0.12 kg) were randomly assigned to 6 treatments (with 6 replicates per treatment and 25 broiler breeder hens and 1 rooster per replicate) and fed a diet with 0.5% SO (control), or a diet with either 0.5% CLA, or CLA plus 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8% SO for 8 wk, with natural mating. The results showed that 0.5% CLA reduced hatchability of fertile eggs (P < 0.0001), which was reversed by SO supplementation and fully recovered at 6% SO (linear, P < 0.0001; quadratic, P < 0.0001). Meanwhile, maternal CLA dietary decreased the mRNA expression level of malic enzyme, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthetase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) (P < 0.05), and increased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î± (PPARÎ±), and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1) (P < 0.05) in the embryonic liver on day 14 and 21. In addition, the protein expression level of phospho-ACC1, phospho-PPARÎ± and CPT1 were increased by maternal CLA dietary (P < 0.05), and the protein expression of phospho-SREBP-1c was inhibited (P < 0.05), indicating that maternal CLA dietary reduced fatty acid (FA) synthesis and accelerated FA catabolism. Soybean oil addition diminished CLA-mediated fatty acid catabolism, via increasing the gene and protein expression of fatty acid synthesis (ME, SREBP-1c, FAS, ACC1) (Linear, P < 0.05) but decreasing that of fatty acid lipolysis (PPARÎ± and CPT1) (Linear, P < 0.05). In conclusion, SO supplementation modulated maternal CLA dietary-induced loss in egg hatchability and hepatic lipolysis in embryo livers. The regulatory mechanism of maternal CLA and SO dietary in offspring lipometabolism might be related to SREBP-1c and PPAR-Î± signaling pathways. Â© 2019",

To extend this literature, we quantified levels of steroids in the eggs of four neotropical dendrobatid frogs that lay terrestrial clutches, a reproductive strategy that has evolved multiple times in amphibians. Building on our observational results, we then manipulated levels of pregnenolone and progesterone in eggs of one species and examined how this affected steroid levels during development. Eggs of all four species had detectable steroids levels, with progestogens being more abundant than androgens and glucocorticoids. Estrogens could not be detected. Immersion of frog eggs in a solution containing pregnenolone and progesterone resulted in elevated levels of both steroids early in development, but levels declined and were similar to those in unmanipulated eggs by the end of development. Treated eggs also exhibited a transient increase in levels of steroids that can be produced from pregnenolone and progesterone. Overall, our findings demonstrate that frog eggs contain steroids similar to what has been observed in other egg-laying vertebrates. During development, steroid levels are dynamic, further suggesting developing embryos regulate exposure to maternal steroids. These results set the stage for investigating the causes and consequences of maternal steroid effects in frogs. Â© 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC. ",

Chronic psychological stress can lead to disease through many pathways, and research from in vitro studies to human longitudinal studies has pointed to stress-induced telomere damage as an important pathway. However, there has not been a comprehensive model to describe how changes in stress physiology and neuroendocrine pathways can lead to changes in telomere biology. Critically short telomeres or the collapse of the telomere structure caused by displacement of telomere binding protein complex shelterin elicit a DNA damage response and lead to senescence or apoptosis. In this narrative review, we summarize the key roles glucocorticoids, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondria, and inflammation play in mediating the relationship between psychological stress and telomere maintenance. We emphasis that these mediators are interconnected and reinforce each other in positive feedback loops. Telomere length has not been studied across the lifespan yet, but the initial setting point at birth appears to be the most influential point, as it sets the lifetime trajectory, and is influenced by stress. We describe two types of intergenerational stress effects on telomeres â€“ prenatal stress effects on telomeres during fetal development, and â€˜telotype transmissionâ€ â€“the directly inherited transmission of short telomeres from parental germline. It is clear that the initial simplistic view of telomere length as a mitotic clock has evolved into a far more complex picture of both transgenerational telomere influences, and of interconnected molecular and cellular pathways and networks, as hallmarks of aging where telomere maintenance is a key player interacting with mitochondria. Further mechanistic investigations testing this comprehensive model of stress mediators shaping telomere biology and the telomere-mitochondrial nexus will lead to better understanding from cell to human lifespan aging, and could lead to anti-aging interventions.

However, little is known about the long-term effects of environmental perturbations on the production and maintenance of these secondary sex characteristics in avian species. In zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), redder beaks indicate increased carotenoid expression and implantation into beak tissue, and female zebra finches prefer males with pronounced bright red beaks as a mate. The present study examines the long-term effects of embryonic incubation temperature on the maturation of beak color in zebra finches. We also investigated the effects of embryonic incubation temperature on sensitivity to a handling and restraint stressor in adulthood. Specifically, the aims of this study were to examine: (1) whether suboptimal incubation temperatures affect the timing of beak color development and color characteristics before and after sexual maturity, (2) if repeated handling causes short-term changes in beak color and whether color changes are related to embryonic thermal environment, and (3) how thermal stress during incubation alters future responses to a repeated handling stressor. Zebra finch eggs were randomly assigned to one of three incubators: â€œControl,â€ â€œLow,â€ or â€œPeriodic Cooling.â€ Beak color (hue, saturation, and value) was quantified before [45, 60, 75 days post-hatch (dph)] and after sexual maturity (95 dph), as well as after repeated handling stress later in adulthood (avg of 386 dph). We found that there were age- and sex- specific effects of incubation treatment on beak hue, where females from periodically cooled eggs had decreased hues (redder) in adulthood. Additionally, eggs laid later in a clutch had decreased beak saturation levels throughout life regardless of incubation environment. We found that females had lower beak hue and saturation following a capture and restraint stressor, while males showed increased beak saturation. Lastly, males subjected to the Low incubation treatment had relatively higher activity levels during restraint than those in the Control group. Overall, these findings suggest that fluctuating incubation temperatures combined with repeated, short-term stressors can have significant, sex-specific effects on sexual ornamentation and behavior.

Multivariate effects on offspring phenotype were evaluated in a study on captive zebra finches, by simultaneously manipulating maternally derived antibodies (MAb) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment of mothers and injection of testosterone into the egg yolk. LPS treatment had a positive effect on body mass growth at 30 days after hatching and immune response at sexual maturity, while egg testosterone treatment positively influenced immune response at fledging and courtship behaviour in sexually mature male offspring. Maternal effects are known to modulate offspring telomere length (TL). However, the multivariate effects of egg-derived maternal components on offspring telomere dynamics from hatching to sexual maturity are undefined. Here, we tested: (1) the effects of LPS and testosterone treatments on TL from hatching to sexual maturity (day 82); (2) how LPS treatment modulated TL over reproduction in adult females; and (3) the relationship between maternal and offspring TL. We predicted that TL would be shorter in LPS fledglings (as a cost of faster growth) and that TL would be longer in sexually mature adults after yolk testosterone treatment (as a proxy of individual quality). In adult females, there was an overall negative relationship between laying and rearing investments and TL, this relationship was weaker in LPS-treated females. In chicks, therewas an overall negative effect of LPS treatment on TL measured at fledging and sexual maturity (day 25-82). In addition, at fledging, there was a SexÃ—LPSÃ—Testosterone interaction, suggesting the existence of antagonistic effects of our treatments. Our data partially support the hypothesis that telomeres are proxies of individual quality and that individual differences in TL are established very early in life. Â© 2020.

In natural populations, it is expected that environmental conditions influence an individual's ageing trajectory. Understanding the role of environmental heterogeneity on ageing variation could provide critical insights into population resilience and species distribution but remains overlooked. Telomeres, the end cap of chromosomes, are a promising integrative physiological marker of an individual's health and a possible proxy to aid the understanding of variation in ageing trajectories. Here, we review the existing information on telomere length and its dynamics in wild populations distributed across spatial scales. Despite a relative scarcity of information, there is evidence for divergence in telomere length between populations facing contrasting environments. Nonetheless, a higher spatial resolution and temporal replication are needed to fully understand the role that environmental conditions play on telomere length variation. Since most of the existing studies are correlational, future field and laboratory experiments are required. For the first time, we demonstrate the use of population telomere data to predict species habitat suitability through species distribution models (SDMs). This represents a promising new research area in the study of ageing pattern variation in wild populations. Furthermore, the inclusion of telomere data in future physiological SDMs may improve our understanding of species distribution and population resilience. However, the use of telomeres within this context could be limited if no previous knowledge on the relevance of telomeres as markers of health and survival at the species level is available. Finally, we suggest some key practical and theoretical considerations that, ideally, future studies combining biogeographic and telomere data should pay attention. Â© 2021 The Authors.

By 2100, global ocean temperature is expected to rise by 1â€“4Â°C, with potential consequences for stress physiology. Global warming is affecting animal populations worldwide through chronic temperature increases and an increase in the frequency of extreme heatwave events. As ectotherms, fishes are expected to be particularly vulnerable to global warming. Although little information is available about the effects of global warming on stress physiology in nature, multiple studies describe the consequences of temperature increases on stress physiology in controlled laboratory conditions, providing insight into what can be expected in the wild. Chronic temperature increase constitutes a physiological load that can alter the ability of fishes to cope with additional stressors, which might compromise their fitness. In addition, rapid temperature increases are known to induce acute stress responses in fishes and might be of ecological relevance in particular situations. This review summarizes knowledge about effects of temperature increases on the stress physiology of fishes and discusses these in the context of global warming.

To flexibly influence offspring, mothers should be able to transmit the hormonal signals independent of their own hormonal status. However, the ability to regulate hormone transfer to the next generation is under debate. We studied the transfer of thyroid hormones (THs) to eggs in a bird model. We elevated thyroxine (T4, the prohormone for the biologically active triiodothyronine, T3) during egg laying using T4 implants in females of a wild population of pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca), and measured the resulting plasma and yolk T4 and T3 levels. We found an increase in plasma and yolk T4 and no change in plasma or yolk T3 concentration, leading to a decrease in yolk T3/T4 ratio in response to the T4 treatment. The yolk T3/T4 ratio was similar to the plasma ratio in females during the yolking phase. This suggests that mothers are not able to regulate TH transfer to yolk but may regulate the T4 to T3 conversion to avoid potential costs of elevated exposure to the active hormone to herself and to her progeny. The absence of regulation in hormone transfer to eggs is in contrast to our predictions. Future studies on deiodinase activity that converts T4 to T3 in maternal and embryonic tissues may help our understanding of how mothers regulate circulating THs during breeding, as well as the embryos' role in converting maternal T4 to its biologically active T3 form during development.

Experimental manipulations of maternally transferred hormones have yielded increasingly contradictory results, which may be explained by differential effects of hormones under different environmental contexts. Yet context-dependent effects have rarely been experimentally tested. We therefore studied whether maternally transferred thyroid hormones (THs) exert context-dependent effects on offspring survival and physiology by manipulating both egg TH levels and post-hatching nest temperature in wild pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) using a full factorial design. We found no clear evidence for context-dependent effects of prenatal THs related to postnatal temperature on growth, survival and potential underlying physiological responses (plasma TH levels, oxidative stress and mitochondrial density). We conclude that future studies should test for other key environmental conditions, such as food availability, to understand potential context-dependent effects of maternally transmitted hormones on offspring, and their role in adapting to changing environments.

Changes in the production of the steroid hormone testosterone (T) are thought to mediate phenotypic responses to competition, but research over the past few decades has yielded mixed results, leading to several potential explanations as to why T does not always elevate following a social challenge. Here, we measured T levels in tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), a system in which females compete for limited nesting cavities and female aggression is at least partially mediated by T. We experimentally induced social challenges in two ways: (1) using decoys to simulate territorial intrusions and (2) removing subsets of nesting cavities to increase competition among displaced and territory-holding females. Critically, these experiments occurred pre-laying, when females are physiologically capable of rapidly increasing circulating T levels. However, despite marked aggression in both experiments, T did not elevate following real or simulated social challenges, and in some cases, socially challenged females had lower T levels than controls. Likewise, the degree of aggression was negatively correlated with T levels following a simulated territorial intrusion. Though not in line with the idea that social challenges prompt T elevation in preparation for future challenges, these patterns nevertheless connect T to territorial aggression in females. Coupled with past work showing that T promotes aggression, these results suggest that T may act rapidly to allow animals to adaptively respond to the urgent demands of a competitive event.

However, chronic exposure to high concentrations of glucocorticoids can lead to metabolic dysregulation, impaired immune function, and cognitive decline. In developing young, this hormonal stress response shows considerable variation. Generally, the physiological stress response of young of precocial species is comparable to that of adults, whereas offspring of altricial species exhibit an attenuated response compared to adults. The developmental hypothesis of the HPA axis proposes that the dampened stress response in dependent offspring is an adaptive response to avoid the negative effects of elevated glucocorticoids, particularly in altricial species where young lack the ability to mitigate stressful stimuli. We aimed to test the developmental hypothesis in a tropical avian species, the lance-tailed manakin (Chiroxiphia lanceolata). We predicted that nestlings of this altricial species should have a dampened corticosterone response, in both magnitude and duration, compared to that of adults. We also predicted that recently fledged hatch-year birds would display a response intermediate to that of adults and nestlings. We quantified circulating corticosterone levels in adults, recently fledged hatch-year birds, and 11-day-old nestlings using a standardized capture and restraint protocol. Nestlings showed a lower maximal corticosterone response and faster negative feedback compared to adults. Further, five post-fledging hatch-year birds showed a feedback response intermediate to those of nestlings and adults. However, we caution against generalizing about fledgling responses beyond this study due to the small sample (n = 5). Interestingly, lance-tailed manakin nestlings appear to return to baseline concentrations faster than nestlings of temperate species. These results support the developmental hypothesis of the HPA axis explaining variation in stress response. This study is the first to assess the development of the hormonal stress response in nestlings of a tropical bird, which is of interest because of our still-developing understanding of how tropical and temperate species differ physiologically. Finally, findings here underscore the importance of validating and adjusting sampling protocols that quantify nestling stress responses, as sampling timelines identified for adults may underestimate the magnitude of the nestling stress response.

So far, the studies that experimentally investigated the consequences of maternal THs focused on short-term effects, while early organisational effects with long-term consequences, as shown for other prenatal hormones, could also be expected. In this study, we aimed at investigating both the short- and long-term effects of prenatal THs in a bird species, the Japanese quail Coturnix japonica. We experimentally elevated yolk TH content (the prohormone T4, and its active metabolite T3, as well as a combination of both hormones). We analysed hatching success, embryonic development, offspring growth and oxidative stress as well as their potential organisational effects on reproduction, moult and oxidative stress in adulthood. We found that eggs injected with T4 had a higher hatching success compared with control eggs, suggesting conversion of T4 into T3 by the embryo. We detected no evidence for other short-term or long-term effects of yolk THs. These results suggest that yolk THs are important in the embryonic stage of precocial birds, but other short- and long-term consequences remain unclear. Research on maternal THs will greatly benefit from studies investigating how embryos use and respond to this maternal signalling. Long-term studies on prenatal THs in other taxa in the wild are needed for a better understanding of this hormone-mediated maternal pathway. Â© 2020 Sarraude et al.",

First, we will describe how multilevel models with multiple random effects (i.e., hierarchical three-, four-, five-level models and cross-classified random effects models) are applied in meta-analysis. Second, we will illustrate how in some specific three-level meta-analyses, a more sophisticated model could have been used to deal with additional dependencies in the data. Third and last, we will describe the distribution of the characteristics of multilevel meta-analyses (e.g., distribution of the number of outcomes across studies or which dependencies are typically modeled) so that future simulation studies can simulate more realistic conditions. Results showed that four- or five-level or cross-classified random effects models are not often used although they might account better for the meta-analytic data structure of the analyzed datasets.

This is particularly important considering that commercial chicken meat birds spend a significant proportion of their life in ovo, and alteration to the in ovo environment can permanently â€˜programâ€™ progeny endocrine pathways. The maternal environment is greatly influenced by factors such as nutrition and stress, both of which play a significant role in the chicken meat breeder industry due to feed restriction practices, ranging from 25% to 80% ad libitum intake. The effects of nutrition and stress and their influence on the maternal environment have been extensively investigated in mammalian literature, primarily focusing on the development and function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) in offspring including the exposure of the stress hormone cortisol. Disruption of the HPA axis can inadvertently disrupt other important endocrine pathways, involved in growth and metabolism, including the growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor I axis (GH/IGF-I) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis (HPT). The disruption or â€˜reprogrammingâ€™ of metabolic endocrine axes through maternal influences has been linked to variations in progeny performance, including growth rate and body composition; however, the underlying physiological mechanisms responsible for these phenotypic differences still remain unclear, especially in poultry. The aim of this review is to assess current industry practices that may influence the maternal (breeder hen) environment, whilst reviewing the concept of developmental programming, and its application to chicken meat production.

We advocate a dynamic view of embryos as organisms capable of responding â€“ on both ecological and evolutionary timescales â€“ to their developmental environments. By viewing embryos in this way, rather than assuming an inability of pre-hatching stages to adapt and respond, we can broaden the ontogenetic breadth of evolutionary and ecological research. Both biotic and abiotic factors affect embryogenesis, and embryos exhibit a broad range of behavioural and physiological responses that enable them to deal with changes in their developmental environments in the course of interactions with their parents, with other embryos, with predators, and with the physical environment. Such plasticity may profoundly affect offspring phenotypes and fitness, and in turn influence the temporal and spatial dynamics of populations and communities. Future research in this field could benefit from an integrated framework that combines multiple approaches (field investigations, manipulative experiments, ecological modelling) to clarify the mechanisms and consequences of embryonic adaptations and plasticity.

Brood parasitism often imparts substantial fitness losses upon host nestlings when they are raised alongside the typically more competitive, larger, and older parasitic chick(s). Whereas fitness costs due to reduced host offspring survival in parasitized broods have been studied in detail, the physiological changes in host nestlings caused by parasitic nestmate(s) are less well known. We compared prothonotary warbler (Protonotaria citrea) nestlings, a host of the nest-sharing brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater), in experimentally parasitized vs. non-parasitized broods. Our aim was to determine whether cohabitation with brood parasitic young impacted host nestling baseline corticosterone plasma concentrations, immune responses, body condition, and mortality. Corticosterone levels and body condition of host nestlings were similar between nests with or without a cowbird nestmate, whereas host immune responses were lower and nestling mortality was greater in parasitized broods, irrespective of variation in brood size or total brood mass. We detected no trade-offs of baseline corticosterone levels with either immune responses or with body condition. These results suggest that this host speciesâ€™ nestlings experience some adverse fitness-relevant physiological effects in parasitized broods, but are also resilient in other aspects when coping with brood parasitism.

The early development of behavioral types and the influence of environmental, mostly social, factors have almost not been studied for natural animal populations. We investigated the effect of the density of non-relative social environment on the development of the behavior of free-living chicks of the Black-headed Gull (Chroicocephalus ridibundus). Material and Methods. In order to exclude the influence of relationships with native parents on the development of chicks' behavior, 21 clutches were cross-fostered so as to destroy any negative relationship between the aggressiveness of their parents and the density of their neighbors. The behavioral types of chicks were determined by a 3-time testing in an â€œopen fieldâ€ arena at the ages of 2-3, 8-9 and 14-15 days. Results. Those parents, which effectively coped with close neighboring at the nest settling period, raised more active offspring. The behavior of chicks raised by foster parents, on the contrary, was more passive the fewer unrelated chicks there were nearby and was not associated with the aggressiveness of their parents. Conclusion. Our work demonstrates the role of an unrelated social environment in the ontogeny of behavioral types in colonial birds. We suppose that the different ways in which influences of parents and neighbors optimize the trajectories of development of behavioral types at an individual level, increase the chances of chicks surviving in the diverse and variable environment of a breeding colony.

One important aspect of avian responses to climate change is how weather conditions may change nestling growth and development. Early life growth is sensitive to environmental effects and can potentially have long-lasting effects on adult phenotypes and fitness. A detailed understanding of both how and when weather conditions affect the entire growth trajectory of a nestling may help predict population changes in phenotypes and demography under climate change. This review covers three main topics on the impacts of weather variation (air temperature, rainfall, wind speed, solar radiation) on nestling growth. Firstly, we highlight why understanding the effects of weather on nestling growth might be important in understanding adaptation to, and population persistence in, environments altered by climate change. Secondly, we review the documented effects of weather variation on nestling growth curves. We investigate both altricial and precocial species, but we find a limited number of studies on precocial species in the wild. Increasing temperatures and rainfall have mixed effects on nestling growth, while increasing windspeeds tend to have negative impacts on the growth rate of open cup nesting species. Thirdly, we discuss how weather variation might affect the evolution of nestling growth traits and suggest that more estimates of the inheritance of and selection acting on growth traits in natural settings are needed to make evolutionary predictions. We suggest that predictions will be improved by considering concurrently changing selection pressures like urbanization. The importance of adaptive plastic or evolutionary changes in growth may depend on where a species or population is located geographically and the speciesâ€™ life-history. Detailed characterization of the effects of weather on growth patterns will help answer whether variation in avian growth frequently plays a role in adaption to climate change.

Oviparous reptiles are capable of altering offspring phenotype through differential allocation of physiological factors during vitellogenesis (yolk formation), depending upon the external environment and the physiological state of the female. Despite its importance in protecting developing offspring against infection, maternal transfer of immune factors has rarely been studied in reptiles. Furthermore, the extent to which offspring may be impacted by the inherent oxidative costs of vitellogenesis is not well understood. Using the Side-blotched Lizard (Uta stansburiana) as a model, we examined how reproductive investment (clutch size and mass) influenced maternal immunological (BKA) and oxidative state (ROMs) and whether these metrics covaried with egg yolk immunity and oxidative state. We assessed factors influencing variation in egg yolk BKA and ROMs within and across clutches from all females and found that females with smaller clutches had higher BKA and ROMs than females with larger clutches. There was also an overall positive relationship between maternal BKA and ROMs and clutch mass, regardless of clutch size. We did not find maternal and egg yolk BKA and ROMs to be directly related, but yolk ROMs decreased as egg mass increased. Within-clutch variation in yolk BKA and ROMs was not related to maternal investment, but variation among clutches was explained by maternal identity. Because egg yolk physiology can impose long-lasting or permanent changes to offspring, these results create a foundation for future work investigating factors contributing to yolk physiology and highlight the necessity of considering multiple physiological and ecological variables when conducting eco-immunological research.

Here, we review the relationship between immunity, stress, spawning, and sex hormones in fish to gain a better understanding of sex-based differences in fish immune responses and its consequences for aquaculture. It is well known that there is a strong link between the stress response and immune function in fish. In addition, research to date has demonstrated that sexual dimorphism in the stress response exists in many species; yet, the relationship between the sexual dimorphic stress responses and immune function has rarely been explored together. Aside from stress, spawning is also known to trigger changes in fish immune responses. Estrogens and androgens have been shown to modulate the immune system which could account for differences between the two sexes of fish when spawning; however, evidence regarding the sexual dimorphism of these changes varies between fishes and is likely related to the spawning strategy employed by a given species. Sex hormones are also used in aquaculture practices to produce monosex populations, and exposure to these hormones early in development has been shown to impact the development of immune organs in several fishes. While female fish are generally thought to be more robust than males, aquaculture practices should also consider the role that maternal stress has on the immune function of the offspring and what role this plays in compromising the immune response of farmed fish.

Yet, the pathways through which maternal effects occur in wild mammals remain largely unknown. We hypothesise that maternal immune transfer is a key mechanism by which mothers can affect their offspring fitness, and that individual variation in maternally derived antibodies mainly depends on a mother's characteristics and the environmental conditions she experiences. To test this, we assayed six colostrum-derived antibodies in the plasma of 1447 neonates in a wild red deer population. Neonatal antibody levels were mainly affected by maternal genes, environmental variation and costs of prior reproductive investment. We found consistent heterogeneity in maternal performance across traits, with mothers producing the heaviest calves also having calves with more antibodies. Unexpectedly, antibody levels were not associated with calf survival. We provide a unique example of how evolutionary theory on maternal effects can be used to gain insight into the causes of maternal effects in wild populations. Â© 2021 The Authors.

deZwaan2020,Timing and Intensity of Weather Events Shape Nestling Development Strategies in Three Alpine Breeding Songbirds,"de Zwaan, D.R. and Drake, A. and Greenwood, J.L. and Martin, K.",Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,2296701X,8,NA,NA,,,2020,Frontiers Media S.A.,,,10.3389/fevo.2020.570034,"Across taxa, offspring size traits are linked to survival, and life-time fitness. Inclement weather can be a major constraint on offspring growth and parental care. Despite the adaptive benefits of larger offspring, we have a limited understanding of the effects of severe environmental conditions across developmental stages and how coping strategies differ among species. We assessed the influence of inclement weather on offspring size and mass traits within populations of three alpine breeding songbirds in British Columbia: (1) horned lark (Eremophila alpestris), (2) dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis), and (3) savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis). Specifically, we investigated at which stages during early-life development offspring are most vulnerable to inclement weather and whether thresholds exist in the developmental response to severe weather events. Across species, we identified two critical periods that best predicted offspring size: (1) clutch initiation, and (2) the nestling stage. Colder temperatures experienced by the female during clutch initiation were associated with larger, heavier offspring in horned larks but smaller offspring for savannah sparrows, indicating the potential for maternal effects, albeit acting through different mechanisms. Additionally, horned lark offspring were resilient to colder average temperatures during the nestling stage but were vulnerable to extreme cold events and multi-day storms. In contrast, dark-eyed junco nestlings were robust to storms, but smaller size and mass traits were associated with lower daily maximum temperatures (i.e., more mild temperature challenges). We suggest species differences may be linked to life-history traits, such as: (1) the thermoregulatory benefits of larger body mass in horned larks, (2) the benefits of greater nest cover to buffer dark-eyed junco against precipitation events, and (3) delayed clutch initiation for savannah sparrows to limit exposure to cold storms. We provide evidence for stage-specific impacts of inclement weather on offspring development with implications for reproductive success. These results advance our understanding of early-life resilience to stochastic environments, as we may be able to predict differences in the vulnerability of alpine species to increasingly variable and severe weather conditions.

Jubinville2020,Trade-off between aerobic performance and egg production in migratory macaroni penguins,"Jubinville, I. and Williams, T.D. and Trathan, P.N. and Crossin, G.T.",Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology -Part A : Molecular and Integrative Physiology,10956433,247,NA,NA,,,2020,Elsevier Inc.,,,10.1016/j.cbpa.2020.110742,"When successive stages of an organism's life-history overlap, conflicts and trade-offs can emerge due to competition among physiological pathways. For example, long periods of sustained locomotion in migrating birds are supported by the androgenic up-regulation of aerobic factors, such as new red blood cell production and hematocrit. However, towards the end of migration, many female birds begin up-regulating 17ÃŸ-estradiol (E2) to support vitellogenesis and egg production, but E2 secretion is known to have suppressive effects on red blood cell production (anti-erythropoiesis). We explored potential trade-offs between factors related to aerobic performance (hematocrit, reticulocyte index) and the expression of factors related to E2-mediated vitellogenesis (i.e. yolk precursor production) in female macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus), a species in which the physiologies controlling egg production and migratory activity run simultaneously (e.g. females experience a migratory conflict). We collected blood samples from penguins immediately upon their return to the colony, prior to egg laying. Hematocrit was elevated when the penguins returned to the colony (50.05% Â± 3.40 SD), which is similar to pre-laying values observed in other migratory bird species. Furthermore, mean reticulocyte levels were elevated (34.87% Â± 2.34), which is the highest level yet recorded in birds. Similarly, both plasma vitellogenin and yolk-targeted very low density lipoprotein levels were upregulated (2.30 Â± 0.06 Î¼g Zn mlâˆ’1, and 9.70 Â± 0.19 mmol lâˆ’1, respectively), indicating that penguins were reproductively active and producing eggs during migration and upon arrival on land. As predicted, a negative relationship between hematocrit and plasma vitellogenin was found, but we found no evidence to suggest that birds were experiencing reproductive anemia. Alternatively, we attribute the negative relationship to a hemodilution effect of yolk precursor secretion into circulation. It appears that female macaroni penguins are able to preserve hematocrit levels and new red blood cell production when migratory activity overlaps with reproductive processes. Â© 2020",

However, the effects of VDBP on immunity have not been fully studied and the pertinent literatures remain very limited. Objective: In this study, we introduced the exogenous VDBP into DC2.4 and established a stable DC2.4/VDBP cell line to explore the role of this gene in immunity. Methods: Dendritic cells (DCs), as the most effective antigen presenting cells (APC) found so far, are directly involved in regulating some innate immunity. In order to evaluate the biological role of VDBP in DCs, we stably overexpressed VDBP in DCs, and conducted Cell Counting Kitâ€‘8 (CCK-8 kit) and flow cytometry to detect changes in cell function. CCK-8 kit was used to monitor the viability of DCs after gene overexpression, and flow cytometry was used to detect changes in cell cycle distribution and apoptosis. Subsequently, in order to reveal the mechanism of VDBP regulating DCs, we adopted RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Results: CCK-8 results revealed VDBP successfully inhibited viability of DCs. Besides, we found that overexpression of this gene greatly promoted apoptosis and obviously altered the cell cycle distribution of DCs in G1 and G2 phases. Moreover, RNA-seq was carried out and 151 differently expression genes (DEGs) were obtained. In addition, gene differential expression analysis showed that most of them were uniformly enriched in immunity-related pathways. Conclusion: These results indicated that VDBP greatly repressed proliferation, facilitated apoptosis and changed cell cycle in DCs via altering the expression levels of gene associated with their cellular immunity.

A healthy environment helps broodfish to produce normal quality offspring. However, deviation from optimal conditions can disturb body functions that effect the next generation. Here, zebrafish (Danio rerio) was employed to investigate the transgenerational impacts of an immunotoxic and endocrine disruptor, atrazine (AZ). In addition, the possible ameliorated effects of a nutraceutical, Arthrospira platensis (spirulina- SP), was considered. Adult females were either exposed to 0 (Cn), 5 (AZ5), and 50 (AZ50) Î¼g/L AZ or fed SP-supplemented diet (10 g/kg; SP). In combination treatments, fish were also exposed to AZ and fed SP (SP-AZ5 and SP-AZ50). Embryos were obtained after 28 d of exposure. Exposure to AZ50 caused females to produce eggs with significantly lower fertilization and hatching. No changes were observed in the concentrations of thyroid hormones. AZ significantly increased cortisol response and reduced levels of immunoglobulin, lysozyme and complement activities in females and their offspring. SP-AZ5 and SP-AZ50 females, however, resisted to the toxic effects of AZ, produced embryos with lower cortisol content and higher immunity competence. Bactericidal activity of the embryos also showed the transgenerational antimicrobial effects of SP along with the AZ immunotoxicity. Overall, these results indicate that AZ could have long lasting toxic effects on fish, and that dietary SP-supplementation could ameliorate AZ induced transgenerational toxic effects. Â© 2019 ",

It provides population sex ratios that will maximise the sustainability of the population under incipient environmental conditions. Environmental factors responsible for sex determination include temperature, photoperiod, food availability, and population density. These cues stimulate the release of chemical signalling molecules (i.e. hormones) that determine the sex of newborns. We have analysed the responses of three Daphnia pulex clones (I, K, and S), isolated from different natural populations, to juvenile hormone methyl farnesoate (MF) in terms of survivorship, fecundity, production of males and ephippia, and expression of genes involved in sex determination (dsx1) and hormonal regulation (JHAMT, Met, RXR). Clonal individuals were exposed to: (1) high MF concentration (0.8Â ÂµM) combined with stressful conditions; (2) low MF concentration (0.15Â ÂµM) combined with optimal conditions of population density and food availability in two subsequent generations. The genetically different clones of D. pulex differed in the propensity for male and ephippia production and in the sensitivity to the stimuli that lead to the switch from parthenogenetic to sexual reproduction. A significant induction of male production was observed in all three clones when exposed to MF. In conditions mimicking crowding, only clone S produced male offspring even in absence of MF and showed higher expression levels of JHAMT and dsx1 genes. This response suggests that clone S has a high propensity to produce males probably due to a high sensitivity of receptors to environmental stimuli activating the endogenous biosynthesis of MF. However, clone S exposed to high MF concentration produced fewer males than clones I and K, which generally have a low natural propensity to produce males. High MF concentration coupled with conditions mimicking crowding, probably activated a feedback mechanism in clone S via the differential modulation of genes involved in the synthesis as well in the degradation of MF. Exposure to low MF concentration for two subsequent generations resulted in a reduction of male progeny production from the first (G1) to the second (G2) generation. All analysed genes were up-regulated in both generations treated with MF, but with lower expression in G2. The reduced up-regulation of the dsx1 gene matched with the lower male production. Based on our results and literature data, we hypothesised that the maternal dsx1 mRNA probably plays some role early in oocyte development, and causes the eggs that receive the dsx1 signal to develop into males. Exposure to MF for two generations significantly increased ephippia production. These results suggest that the induction of male and ephippia might have a common root in the MF pathway. The effect of MF on life-history traits (delay in the age at maturity and fecundity reduction), sex ratio, and ephippia production suggests a direct impact of the juvenile hormone on the level of population growth. Thus, as a consequence of the switch from parthenogenetic to sexual reproduction, MF influences Daphnia population metrics and in this way probably maximises the sustainability of the population under variable environmental conditions.

Consequently, because turtles display little parental care, maternal provisioning of the eggs and female nesting behavior are under strong selection. But the consequences of when and where nests are laid are affected by anthropogenic habitat disturbances that alter suitable nesting areas, expose eggs to contaminants in the wild, and modify the thermal and hydric environment experienced by developing embryos, thus impacting hatchling survival and the sexual fate of taxa with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) and genotypic sex determination (GSD). Indeed, global and local environmental change influences air, water, and soil temperature and moisture, which impact basking behavior, egg development, and conditions within the nest, potentially rendering current nesting strategies maladaptive as offspring mortality increases and TSD sex ratios become drastically skewed. Endocrine disruptors can sex reverse TSD and GSD embryos alike. Adapting to these challenges depends on genetic variation, and little to no heritability has been detected for nest-site behavior. However, modest heritability in threshold temperature (above and below which females or males develop in TSD taxa, respectively) exists in the wild, as well as interpopulation differences in the reaction norm of sex ratio to temperature, and potentially also in the expression of gene regulators of sexual development. If this variation reflects additive genetic components, some adaptation might be expected, provided that the pace of environmental change does not exceed the rate of evolution. Research remains urgently needed to fill current gaps in our understanding of the ecology and evolution of nest-site choice and its adaptive potential, integrating across multiple levels of organization.

One of the most prevalent behavioral characteristics of urban dwelling animals is an increased level of risk-taking. Here, we aimed to reveal how urban fruitbats become risk-takers, and how they differ behaviorally from rural bats, studying both genetic and non-genetic factors that might play a role in the process. We assessed the personality of newborn pups from both rural and urban colonies before they acquired experience outdoors, examining risk-taking, exploration, and learning rates. Results: Urban pups exhibited significantly higher risk-taking levels, they were faster learners, but less exploratory than their rural counterparts. A cross-fostering experiment revealed that pups were more similar to their adoptive mothers, thus suggesting a non-genetic mechanism and pointing towards a maternal effect. We moreover found that lactating urban mothers have higher cortisol levels in their milk, which could potentially explain the transmission of some personality traits from mother to pup. Conclusions: Young bats seem to acquire environment suitable traits via post-birth non-genetic maternal effects. We offer a potential mechanism for how urban pups can acquire urban-suitable behavioral traits through hormonal transfer from their mothers. Â© 2021, The Author(s).",

This procedure performed on living, restrained birds is qualified as an animal experiment according to German/European legislation, which has to be applied for from the competent authorities. The Directive 2010/63/EU requires the full implementation of the 3-R Principle of Russel and Burch in animal experiments, which means not only to replace the use of animals, but also to reduce the number of animals used and to refine procedures whenever possible. In response to this issue, the aim of this study was to validate an alternative, less invasive sampling method by cutting feathers close to the skin in comparison to the gold standard of plucking them. For this proof-of-principle study, a conventional poultry husbandry with trial groups of geese (Anser anser domesticus) and ducks (Anas sterilis) was selected. All birds were kept under the same living conditions to standardize the influencing factors regarding husbandry, and thus, their stress levels. Feather samples were collected between the shoulders from 46 geese and 51 ducks, both by cutting as well as by plucking, directly after slaughter for meat production. Feather corticosterone levels were measured with Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Results were compared using Blandâ€“Altman plots and concordance correlation coefficients (CCC). It could be seen that concordance between corticosterone levels in cut and plucked feathers was rather poor: 0.38 for Anser, and 0.57 for Anas. However, comparing the mean corticosterone values in pg/mm of each species with their respective standard deviations, the differences between the methods were negligible. As the results showed that the differences between the individuals were markedly greater than the differences between the methods, the determination of corticosterone levels in cut feathers is valid compared to using plucked feathers. The validation tests of ELISA showed only acceptable repeatability and reliability. Hence, the results should be verified in further studies. In conclusion, it is recommended for future research to use cut instead of plucked feathers for corticosterone measurement. Â© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. ",

Effective cognitive mechanisms could provide adequate responses for individuals to adapt to changing habitats and should be selected for. Studying the direct impact of the unpredictably changing environment on learning performance is particularly important in juvenile animals, because their learning abilities are in development and any impairment can affect their fitness. In this study, we bred zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, in stable or variable ambient temperature conditions. At hatching, half of the birds in each family were cross-fostered to a different condition while the other half remained in their original one. Just prior to their independence, we assessed their associative learning performance of 209 juveniles. Using a novel colour associative test apparatus, we compared the participation rate, latency to choice and learning performance between the experimental groups. We found that the juveniles that originated from the stable condition and that experienced environmental instability after hatching had the highest participation rate and the shortest latency to choice. Our results also showed that individuals that made quicker choices performed significantly better in the learning test than the slower birds. This finding was opposite to the often-postulated speedâ€“accuracy trade-off, usually manifested by more accurate learning of slower individuals. There was no direct effect of temperature variability on the learning performance. However, we suggest that the differences in activity and latency (measures often used as proxies of personality traits) could be attributed to personality bias which may indirectly affect the outcome and interpretation of cognitive research. We discuss our results in relation to the long-term effects of environmental variability on animal activeness and cognitive abilities as well as the mechanisms responsible for the variation in learning performance.

While the effects of elevated maternal glucocorticoids on offspring phenotype (i.e., â€œglucocorticoid-mediated maternal effectsâ€) have been relatively well established in laboratory studies, it remains poorly understood how strong and consistent such effects are in natural populations. Using a meta-analysis of studies of wild mammals, birds, and reptiles, we investigate the evidence for effects of elevated maternal glucocorticoids on offspring phenotype and investigate key moderators that might influence the strength and direction of these effects. In particular, we investigate the potential importance of reproductive mode (viviparity vs. oviparity). We show that glucocorticoid-mediated maternal effects are stronger, and likely more deleterious, in mammals and viviparous squamate reptiles compared with birds, turtles, and oviparous squamates. No other moderators (timing and type of manipulation, age at offspring measurement, or type of trait measured) were significant predictors of the strength or direction of the phenotypic effects on offspring. These results provide evidence that the evolution of a prolonged physiological association between embryo and mother sets the stage for maladaptive, or adaptive, prenatal stress effects in vertebrates driven by glucocorticoid elevation.

Therefore, the temporal dynamics of techniques used to assess â€˜stressâ€™ need to be fully understood in order to be applied correctly. In this review, we provide information on 37 physiological and behavioural metrics that are commonly used to measure stress, especially in wild free-living vertebrates, with a particular focus on which time-scale they integrate stress. We organize these metrics into seven broad categories based on which physiological system they are most closely associated with (glucocorticoids, sympathetic/parasympathetic nervous system, immune, metabolic, cellular/molecular, tissue development and behaviour). We conclude by summarizing which kind of biological questions and variation each technique is most suitable for.

However, maternal effects on offspring phenotype do not evolve in isolation, but rather within the context of a family unit, where the separate and often conflicting evolutionary interests of mothers, fathers and offspring are all at play. While intrafamilial conflicts are routinely invoked to explain other components of reproductive strategy, remarkably little is known about how intrafamilial conflicts influence maternal effects. We argue that much of the considerable variation in the relationship between maternally derived hormones, nutrients and other compounds and the resulting offspring phenotype might be explained by the presence of conflicting selection pressures on different family members. In this review, we examine the existing literature on maternal hormone allocation as a case study for maternal effects more broadly, and explore new hypotheses that arise when we consider current findings within a framework that explicitly incorporates the different evolutionary interests of the mother, her offspring and other family members. Specifically, we hypothesise that the relationship between maternal hormone allocation and offspring phenotype depends on a mother's ability to manipulate the signals she sends to offspring, the ability of family members to be plastic in their response to those signals and the capacity for the phenotypes and strategies of various family members to interact and influence one another on both behavioural and evolutionary timescales. We also provide suggestions for experimental, comparative and theoretical work that may be instrumental in testing these hypotheses. In particular, we highlight that manipulating the level of information available to different family members may reveal important insights into when and to what extent maternal hormones influence offspring development. We conclude that the evolution of maternal hormone allocation is likely to be shaped by the conflicting fitness optima of mothers, fathers and offspring, and that the outcome of this conflict depends on the relative balance of power between family members. Extending our hypotheses to incorporate interactions between family members, as well as more complex social groups and a wider range of taxa, may provide exciting new developments in the fields of endocrinology and maternal effects.

We measured levels of 10 perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) in egg yolks of yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis) breeding in the northern Adriatic Sea (Northeast Italy). We examined variations in PFAAs within clutches (between eggs of different laying order) and among clutches. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the most abundant yolk PFAA (mean = 42.0 ng/g wet wt), followed by perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; 3.8 ng/g wet wt) and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDa; 2.8 ng/g wet wt). The âˆ‘PFAAs averaged 57.4 ng/g wet weight, ranging between 26.5 and 115.0 ng/g wet weight.

In this species, we previously found that yolk hormone deposition varies among eggs of different captive populations and could influence chicks' physiology and behavior. However, it is still unknown whether females can modify yolk hormone deposition in a changing social environment. Using a captive population of Greater Rheas, in this study, we quantified yolk hormone levels before and after a reduction in the number of females present in the population. We found that females deposited on average higher yolk corticosterone and lower yolk progesterone after the change in their social environment. Since corticosterone deposited into the yolk comes exclusively from the female's plasma, our results suggest that females had, on average, higher plasma corticosterone levels. The change in the number of females may increase the events of maleâ€“male competitions, courtships, and matings, leading to an increase of corticosterone in the females' plasma and then into their eggs. Since we previously found that higher yolk corticosterone and lower yolk progesterone were associated with the production of chicks that have an attenuated stress response, the present study results suggest that yolk hormone deposition is mediated by flexible mechanisms that could adjust development to the prevailing conditions.

However, this adjustment requires flexible mechanisms of regulation that lead to the absence of a correlation between hormone levels in the mother and the yolk. In this study, we examined whether yolk immunoreactive corticosterone and maternal glucocorticoid levels are related in the Greater Rhea (Rhea americana), a ratite species with a communal nesting system. During the intermediate laying period of the season, we carried out daily nest-observations to collect those eggs in which the laying female was identified. We also collected fresh fecal samples from the identified laying females to quantify their fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) levels during the yolk formation period (7Â days before egg-laying). Yolk immunoreactive corticosterone and FGM levels were measured using a corticosterone125 radioimmunoassay kit, previously validated for the species. No significant relationships were found between female FGM and yolk immunoreactive corticosterone. Although futures studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, our results suggest that Greater Rhea female may be able to control the distribution of corticosterone into their yolks, supporting the idea that this hormone may be mediating an adaptive maternal effect.

Consistency can make behavior an adaptive trait for mate choice decisions. Here, we present a conceptual framework to explain how and why females might evaluate a male's BT before mating. Because BTs are consistent across time or context, a male's BT can be a reliable indicator of his potential to provide direct benefits. Heritable BTs can enable informed mate choice via indirect benefits. Many key issues regarding patterns of mate choice, including sensory biases, context dependence, and assortative mating apply to BT-dependent mate choice. Understanding the relationship between BTs and mate choice may offer insights into patterns of variation and consistency common in behavioral traits. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
