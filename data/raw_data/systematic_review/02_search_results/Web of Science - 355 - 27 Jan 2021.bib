Abstract = {{Avian eggs contain a large number of molecules deposited by the mother
   that provide the embryo with energy but also potentially influence its
   development via the effects of maternally derived hormones and
   antibodies: the avian egg is thus `multivariate'. Multivariate effects
   on offspring phenotype were evaluated in a study on captive zebra
   finches, by simultaneously manipulating maternally derived antibodies
   (MAb) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment of mothers and injection of
   testosterone into the egg yolk. LPS treatment had a positive effect on
   body mass growth at 30 days after hatching and immune response at sexual
   maturity, while egg testosterone treatment positively influenced immune
   response at fledging and courtship behaviour in sexually mature male
   offspring. Maternal effects are known to modulate offspring telomere
   length (TL). However, the multivariate effects of egg-derived maternal
   components on offspring telomere dynamics from hatching to sexual
   maturity are undefined. Here, we tested: (1) the effects of LPS and
   testosterone treatments on TL from hatching to sexual maturity (day 82);
   (2) how LPS treatment modulated TL over reproduction in adult females;
   and (3) the relationship between maternal and offspring TL. We predicted
   that TL would be shorter in LPS fledglings (as a cost of faster growth)
   and that TL would be longer in sexually mature adults after yolk
   testosterone treatment (as a proxy of individual quality). In adult
   females, there was an overall negative relationship between laying and
   rearing investments and TL, this relationship was weaker in LPS-treated
   females. In chicks, there was an overall negative effect of LPS
   treatment on TL measured at fledging and sexual maturity (day 25-82). In
   addition, at fledging, there was a SexxLPSxTestosterone interaction,
   suggesting the existence of antagonistic effects of our treatments. Our
   data partially support the hypothesis that telomeres are proxies of
   individual quality and that individual differences in TL are established
   very early in life.}},

Title = {{Egg corticosterone can stimulate telomerase activity and promote longer
   telomeres during embryo development}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{It is often assumed that the transfer of maternal glucocorticoids (GCs;
   e.g., corticosterone or cortisol) to offspring is an inevitable cost
   associated with adverse or stressful conditions experienced by mothers.
   However, recent evidence indicates that maternal GCs may adaptively
   programme particular physiological and molecular pathways during
   development to enhance offspring fitness. In this context, an important
   mechanism through which maternal GCs may lastingly affect offspring
   phenotypic quality and survival is via effects on embryo telomerase
   activity and so on offspring postnatal telomere length. Here, using a
   field experimental design for which we manipulated the corticosterone
   content in yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) eggs, we show that
   embryos from corticosterone-injected eggs not only had a higher
   telomerase activity but also longer telomeres just after hatching. A
   complementary analysis further revealed that gull hatchlings with longer
   telomeres had a higher survival probability during the period when most
   of the chick mortality occurs. Given the important role that telomere
   length and its restoring mechanisms have on ageing trajectories and
   disease risk, our findings provide a new mechanistic link by which
   mothers may presumably shape offspring life-history trajectories and
   phenotype.}},

Title = {{Developmental programming of the adrenocortical stress response by yolk
   testosterone depends on sex and life history stage}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{223}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Developmental exposure of embryos to maternal hormones such as
   testosterone in the avian egg influences the expression of multiple
   traits, with certain effects being sex specific and lasting into
   adulthood. This pleiotropy, sex dependency and persistency may be the
   consequence of developmental programming of basic systemic processes
   such as adrenocortical activity or metabolic rate. We investigated
   whether experimentally increased in ovo exposure to testosterone
   influenced hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal function, i.e. baseline and
   stress-induced corticosterone secretion, and resting metabolic rate
   (RMR) of adult male and female house sparrows (Passer domesticus). In
   previous experiments with this passerine bird we demonstrated effects of
   embryonic testosterone exposure on adult agonistic and sexual behavior
   and survival. Here we report that baseline corticosterone levels and the
   stress secretion profile of corticosterone are modified by in ovo
   testosterone in a sex-specific and life history stage-dependent manner.
   Compared with controls, males from testosterone-treated eggs had higher
   baseline corticosterone levels, whereas females from
   testosterone-treated eggs showed prolonged stress-induced corticosterone
   secretion during the reproductive but not the non-reproductive phase.
   Adult RMR was unaffected by in ovo testosterone treatment but correlated
   with integrated corticosterone stress secretion levels. We conclude that
   exposure of the embryo to testosterone programs the hypothalamus-
   pituitary-adrenal axis in a sex-specific manner that in females depends,
   in expression, on reproductive state. The modified baseline
   corticosterone levels in males and stress-induced corticosterone levels
   in females may explain some of the long-lasting effects of maternal
   testosterone in the egg on behavior and could be linked to previously
   observed reduced mortality of testosterone-treated females.}},

Title = {{Testing different forms of regulation of yolk thyroid hormone transfer
   in pied flycatchers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{223}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Hormones transferred from mothers to their offspring are considered a
   maternal tool to prepare progeny for expected environmental conditions,
   increasing maternal and offspring fitness. To flexibly influence
   offspring, mothers should be able to transmit the hormonal signals
   independent of their own hormonal status. However, the ability to
   regulate hormone transfer to the next generation is under debate. We
   studied the transfer of thyroid hormones (THs) to eggs in a bird model.
   We elevated thyroxine (T-4, the prohormone for the biologically active
   triiodothyronine, T-3) during egg laying using T-4 implants in females
   of a wild population of pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca), and
   measured the resulting plasma and yolk T-4 and T-3 levels. We found an
   increase in plasma and yolk T-4 and no change in plasma or yolk T-3
   concentration, leading to a decrease in yolk T-3/T-4 ratio in response
   to the T-4 treatment. The yolk T-3/T-4 ratio was similar to the plasma
   ratio in females during the yolking phase. This suggests that mothers
   are not able to regulate TH transfer to yolk but may regulate the T-4 to
   T-3 conversion to avoid potential costs of elevated exposure to the
   active hormone to herself and to her progeny. The absence of regulation
   in hormone transfer to eggs is in contrast to our predictions. Future
   studies on deiodinase activity that converts T-4 to T-3 in maternal and
   embryonic tissues may help our understanding of how mothers regulate
   circulating THs during breeding, as well as the embryos' role in
   converting maternal T-4 to its biologically active T-3 form during
   development.}},

   Temperature Than Exogenously Increased Egg Cortisol}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Elevated temperatures resulting from climate change are expected to
   disproportionately affect ectotherms given their biological function has
   a direct link to environmental temperature. Thus, as climate change
   leads to rapid increases in water temperatures in rivers, aquatic
   ectotherms, such as fish may be highly impacted. Organisms can respond
   to these stressors through flexible and rapid phenotypic change induced
   via developmental and/or transgenerational plasticity. In oviparous
   species, gravid females may translate environmental stress across
   generations via increased exposure of eggs to maternally derived
   glucocorticoids (i.e., maternal stress), which has been shown to result
   in diverse phenotypic effects in offspring. Recent studies suggest these
   phenotypic changes from maternal glucocorticoids may elicit predictive
   adaptive responses, where offspring exposed to maternal stress may be
   better prepared for the stressful environment they will encounter (i.e.,
   environmental match hypothesis). We applied the environmental match
   hypothesis to examine whether a prenatal exogenous increase in egg
   cortisol may prepare Chinook salmon offspring (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha)
   to cope with thermal challenges after being reared in chronically
   elevated temperatures. Specifically, we exposed eggs to aqueous bath of
   cortisol-dosed (1,000 ng/mL) or control (0 ng/ml) solutions, and then
   raised both treatments at current (+0 degrees C-contemporary ambient
   river temperature) or elevated (+3 degrees C-projected future river
   temperature) thermal regimes. We quantified thermal performance in fish
   7-9 month post fertilization using two methods: via critical thermal
   maximum (CTMax), and energetic responses (in plasma cortisol, glucose,
   and lactate) to environmentally relevant, but challenging thermal spikes
   over 3 days. Overall, we found that exposure to elevated rearing
   temperatures had a large impact on thermal tolerance, where
   elevated-temperature reared offspring had significantly higher CTMax. In
   comparison, egg cortisol treatment had little to no clear effects on
   CTMax and blood energetic response. Our study demonstrates the
   importance of elevated water temperatures as an inducer of offspring
   phenotypes (via early developmental cues), and highlights the
   significance of examining offspring performance in environments with
   ecologically relevant stressors.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal corticosterone in avian egg yolks may signal and prepare
   offspring for the prevailing conditions. However, this adjustment
   requires flexible mechanisms of regulation that lead to the absence of a
   correlation between hormone levels in the mother and the yolk. In this
   study, we examined whether yolk immunoreactive corticosterone and
   maternal glucocorticoid levels are related in the Greater Rhea (Rhea
   americana), a ratite species with a communal nesting system. During the
   intermediate laying period of the season, we carried out daily
   nest-observations to collect those eggs in which the laying female was
   identified. We also collected fresh fecal samples from the identified
   laying females to quantify their fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM)
   levels during the yolk formation period (7 days before egg-laying). Yolk
   immunoreactive corticosterone and FGM levels were measured using a
   corticosterone(125)radioimmunoassay kit, previously validated for the
   species. No significant relationships were found between female FGM and
   yolk immunoreactive corticosterone. Although futures studies are needed
   to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, our results suggest that Greater
   Rhea female may be able to control the distribution of corticosterone
   into their yolks, supporting the idea that this hormone may be mediating
   an adaptive maternal effect.}},

Abstract = {{Controversial glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) are the most frequently
   used herbicides globally. GBH residues are detected in soil, water,
   crops, and food products, potentially exposing non-target organisms to
   health risks; these organisms include wildlife, livestock, and humans.
   However, the potential for GBH-related parental effects are poorly
   understood. In the case of birds, GBHs may be transferred directly from
   mothers to eggs, or they may indirectly influence offspring performance
   by altered maternal resource allocation to eggs. We experimentally
   exposed a parental generation of Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica) to
   GBHs (200mg/kg feed) or respective controls. Glyphosate residues were
   found in eggs (ca 0.76kg/mg). Embryonic development tended to be poorer
   in the eggs of GBH-exposed parents (76\% of eggs showed normal
   development) compared to control parents (89\% normal eggs). Embryonic
   brain tissue from GBH-exposed parents tended to express more lipid
   damage (20\% higher), yet other biomarkers showed no apparent
   differences. We detected no differences in egg quality (egg, yolk, or
   shell mass, egg hormone concentration) across the treatment groups.
   Given this is the first long-term study testing parental effects of GBHs
   with birds, more studies are needed characterizing GBH-associated
   changes in maternal allocation and for example epigenetic programming.}},

Title = {{Interaction of egg cortisol and offspring experience influences
   stress-related behaviour and physiology in lake sturgeon}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{161}},
Pages = {{49-59}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Quantifying transgenerational effects of stress is important to predict
   outcomes of anthropogenic disturbances for wildlife species. Maternal
   stress can programme physiological and behavioural phenotypes in
   offspring, which may be maladaptive if maternal and offspring
   environments are mismatched. We investigated effects of a match and
   mismatch between egg cortisol and offspring stress levels in lake
   sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, using artificially elevated egg cortisol
   levels (simulating maternal stress) and a chronic unpredictable stress
   regime for offspring after hatch. Offspring cortisol levels were
   quantified at baseline and after an acute stressor. Multiple measures of
   offspring swimming activity were assessed in behaviour trials.
   Individuals that experienced elevated egg cortisol and high offspring
   stress exhibited a diminished cortisol response to an acute stressor,
   but responses varied among offspring from different families. Results
   suggest that the interaction between maternal and offspring experience
   may cue an offspring phenotype that is adaptive in high-stress
   conditions. Principal components analysis characterizing interindividual
   variation in offspring behavioural variables showed that treatment
   significantly affected multivariate offspring response along the PC1
   axis (associated with inactivity), and both treatment and family
   significantly affected response along the PC2 axis (associated with
   shorter distance moved). The largest differences for PC1 occurred
   between the `mismatch' treatments (high egg cortisol and low offspring
   stress exhibiting lower activity; low egg cortisol and high offspring
   stress exhibiting higher activity), indicating that the combination of
   egg cortisol and offspring stress is more important in determining
   offspring behaviour than is egg cortisol or offspring stress alone.
   Findings suggest that family effects, such as genetic components or
   maternal experience, may mediate how the interaction of maternal and
   offspring stress influences offspring physiological and behavioural
   outcomes, and indicate the need for further research into environmental
   factors experienced by females that influence how offspring respond to
   egg cortisol and early life stress. (C) 2020 The Association for the

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{2213-2224}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Wildlife inhabiting urban environments exhibit drastic changes in
   morphology, physiology, and behavior. It has often been argued that
   these phenotypic responses could be the result of micro-evolutionary
   changes following the urbanization process. However, other mechanisms
   such as phenotypic plasticity, maternal effects, and developmental
   plasticity could be involved as well. To address maternal effects as
   potential mechanisms, we compared maternal hormone and antibody
   concentrations in eggs between city and forest populations of European
   blackbirds (Turdus merula), a widely distributed species for which
   previous research demonstrated differences in behavioral and
   physiological traits. We measured egg and yolk mass, yolk concentrations
   of androgens (androstenedione {[}A(4)], testosterone {[}T], 5
   alpha-dihydrotestosterone {[}5 alpha-DHT], and immunoglobulins {[}IgY])
   and related them to population, clutch size, laying order, embryo sex,
   and progress of breeding season. We show (a) earlier onset of laying in
   the city than forest population, but similar egg and clutch size; (b)
   higher overall yolk androgen concentrations in the forest than the city
   population (sex-dependent for T); (c) greater among-female variation of
   yolk T and 5 alpha-DHT concentrations in the forest than city
   population, but similar within-clutch variation; (d) similar IgY
   concentrations with a seasonal decline in both populations; and (e)
   population-specific positive (city) or negative (forest) association of
   yolk A(4) and T with IgY concentrations. Our results are consistent with
   the hypotheses that hormone-mediated maternal effects contribute to
   differences in behavioral and physiological traits between city and
   forest individuals and that yolk androgen and immunoglobulin levels can
   exhibit population-specific relationships rather than trade-off against
   each other.}},

Title = {{Characterizing the timing of yolk testosterone metabolism and the
   effects of etiocholanolone on development in avian eggs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{223}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Maternal transfer of steroids to eggs can elicit permanent effects on
   offspring phenotype. Although testosterone was thought to be a key
   mediator of maternal effects in birds, we now know that vertebrate
   embryos actively regulate their exposure to maternal testosterone
   through steroid metabolism, suggesting testosterone metabolites, not
   testosterone, may elicit the observed phenotypic effects. To address the
   role steroid metabolism plays in mediating yolk testosterone effects, we
   used European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) eggs to characterize the
   timing of testosterone metabolism and determine whether etiocholanolone,
   a prominent metabolite of testosterone in avian embryos, is capable of
   affecting early embryonic development. Tritiated testosterone was
   injected into freshly laid eggs to characterize steroid movement and
   metabolism during early development. Varying levels of etiocholanolone
   were also injected into eggs, with incubation for either 3 or 5 days, to
   test whether etiocholanolone influences the early growth of embryonic
   tissues. The conversion of testosterone to etiocholanolonewas initiated
   within 12 h of injection, but the increase in etiocholanolone was
   transient, indicating that etiocholanolone is also subject to
   metabolism, and that exposure to maternal etiocholanolone is limited to
   a short period during early development. Exogenous etiocholanolone
   manipulation had no significant effect on the growth rate of the embryos
   or extraembryonic membranes early in development. Thus, the conversion
   of testosterone to etiocholanolone may be an inactivation pathway that
   buffers the embryo from maternal steroids, with any effects of yolk
   testosterone resulting from testosterone that escapes metabolism;
   alternatively, etiocholanolone may influence processes other than growth
   or take additional time to manifest.}},

Title = {{Seasonal changes in yolk hormone concentrations carry-over to offspring
   traits}},
Journal = {{GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{287}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Yolk hormones are substances which transmit non-genetic factors from the
   mother to the next generation. The systematic changes of yolk hormone
   concentrations within asynchronously hatching clutches have been
   interpreted as a means to adaptively shape the offspring's phenotype.
   However, in synchronously hatching clutches the role of yolk hormones is
   less understood. We investigated whether seasonal changes between eggs
   in the yolk hormones testosterone (Testo), progesterone (Prog) and
   corticosterone (Cort) also occur in the grey partridge, a synchronously
   hatching precocial species without direct food competition between
   siblings. Specifically we asked whether yolk hormone concentrations
   systematically vary with season and whether they affect the offspring's
   hatching mass, mass gain, circulating baseline and stress-induced Cort.
   Additionally, we investigated the effect of genetic background and food
   availability on yolk hormone concentrations by subjecting grey partridge
   hens of two strains (wild and domesticated) to two different feeding
   regimes (predictable vs. unpredictable feeding) during egg laying. We
   hypothesized that egg hormone concentrations change over the season, but
   breeding in captivity over many generations and ad libitum food access
   could have resulted in domestication effects which abolished potential
   seasonal effects. Results showed that progressing season had a strong
   positive effect on yolk Prog and yolk Testo, but not on yolk Cort.
   Feeding regimes and strain had no effect on yolk hormones. Offspring
   mass and mass gain increased and baseline Cort decreased with
   progressing season. In addition, yolk Testo correlated positively with
   offspring mass gain and negatively with baseline Cort, while yolk Prog
   had a positive correlation with baseline Cort. Strain and feeding
   regimes of the mother had no effect on offspring traits. In conclusion,
   grey partridge chicks hatching late in the season might benefit from the
   increased concentrations of the growth-stimulating yolk Testo and by
   this catch-up in development. Hence, yolk hormone concentration could
   adaptively shape the offspring phenotype in a precocial species.}},

   Implications for how yolk estradiol influences embryonic development}},
Journal = {{GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{287}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{The steroid 17 beta-estradiol (herein ``estradiol{''}) is a potent
   regulator of sexual differentiation that exerts wide-ranging effects on
   the developing brain and other tissues. The developing gonads are an
   important source of estradiol but most, if not all, vertebrate embryos
   are also exposed to maternally derived estradiol during development. In
   birds, this maternally derived estradiol is present in the egg at the
   time of oviposition but very little is known about how this source of
   estradiol influences development. A critical aspect of understanding
   yolk estradiol effects is deciphering how steroid metabolism may
   regulate embryonic exposure to yolk estradiol. In this study, we examine
   the metabolic fate of estradiol during the first five days of incubation
   in chicken (Gallus gallus) eggs. Using tritiated estradiol to trace the
   movement and metabolism of estradiol, we demonstrate that estradiol is
   metabolized to estrone, which is subsequently conjugated to estrone
   sulfate as the primary metabolite. Estrone sulfate then accumulates in
   the albumen by day five of incubation. Overall, these findings have
   important implications for how yolk estradiol may influence development
   and alter offspring phenotype. Mechanisms through which estradiol, as
   well as estrone sulfate, might elicit effects are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Female birds can influence offspring development by adjusting egg size
   or by a differential allocation of egg resources. Such maternal effects
   can be expected to be shaped by natural selection, given the costs
   connected to the allocation of maternal resources. Among egg components,
   yolk androgens play an important role in affecting offspring
   life-history traits. Despite their relevance for nestling development,
   factors accounting for the observed within- and between-clutch variation
   are still poorly known. By using a cross-sectional sampling approach, we
   tested the effect of female age, laying order and laying date on the
   deposition of yolk androstenedione (A4) and testosterone (T), since
   young and older females could maximize their fitness differently
   according to breeding conditions. We found a remarkable lack of
   differences in overall yolk androgen levels across different ages.
   However, comparing first-year with older females, our results showed
   that age did not influence yolk T levels at the beginning of the
   breeding season, whereas at the end, first-year females transferred
   lower hormone levels than older females. Within clutches, both androgens
   increased across the laying sequence, suggesting that late nestlings
   benefit from an increased allocation that could compensate hatching
   asynchrony. However, when considering A4, we found that, whereas older
   females always increased A4 levels across the laying sequence,
   first-year females did not increase it at the end of the breeding
   season, thus increasing the likelihood of brood reduction when
   environmental conditions became hardest. These findings suggest that
   yolk A4 variation may be particularly important at the within-clutch
   scale, by providing females with a tool to modify nestling hierarchies.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies show that avian females prefer males based on their
   secondary sexual ornaments and dominance status. We tested in red
   junglefowl (Goth's gallus) how comb size affected the result of fighting
   and how the dominance status related to testosterone concentrations in
   their circulation and ejaculates. We subsequently tested how social
   status was related to female reproductive investment, including yolk
   hormone transfer. We found that after a fight 1) winners increased
   plasma T and decreased ejaculates T whereas losers' T remained
   unchanged, and 2) plasma T of winners was higher but ejaculates T was
   lower than those of losers. We argued those are consistent with the
   different reproductive strategies of dominant and subordinate males.
   Furthermore, in line with offspring sex-dependent growth patterns
   females transferred significantly more androstenedione to female than
   male embryos when mated with winners, while doing the opposite when
   mated with losers. We concluded therefore that female reproductive
   investment was affected by both partner quality and embryo sex. The
   results indicate that male quality influences sex-specific maternal
   investment, which could be mediated by ejaculate testosterone
   concentration.}},

Title = {{Genetic variation in maternal yolk testosterone allocation predicts
   female mating decisions in Japanese quail}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{157}},
Pages = {{35-42}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Maternal reproductive effort can be adjusted through the transfer of
   hormones into the eggs, where they influence embryo development,
   mediating short- and long-term maternal effects on offspring phenotype.
   While studies usually explore how females can increase their
   reproductive success through an allocation of yolk testosterone (T)
   under external environmental variability, it is less clear whether
   intrinsically driven interfemale differences in yolk T deposition may
   themselves predict female reproductive decisions. In our study, we used
   Japanese quail, Coturnix japonica, lines divergently selected for high
   (HET) and low (LET) egg T concentrations to examine whether this genetic
   variation in yolk T levels is linked to female mating decisions. First,
   we analysed line differences in male-typical reproductive behaviour and
   how this behavioural response is affected by female line identity. Males
   were tested with females from the same (match pairs) and opposite (cross
   pairs) lines. Next, female mate preferences were evaluated in a
   two-choice test in which females were allowed to choose between males
   from the same and opposite lines. We found no line differences in male
   copulatory behaviour. Interestingly, a shorter latency to copulate and a
   higher number of copulations were recorded in LET males when they were
   mated with HET than LET females. No differences between match and cross
   pairs were found in HET males. In the two-choice test, LET females
   displayed a preference for males from the same over the opposite line,
   but HET females did not discriminate between LET and HET males.
   Collectively, these results demonstrate that genetically high yolk T
   deposition is related to higher receptivity and reduced choosiness in
   female mate preferences in Japanese quail. Moreover, our results
   indicate an important link between maternal investment, reproductive
   physiology and female mating decisions, pointing out evolutionary
   implications and a role of variation in female mate choice in sexual
   selection. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Maternal hormones are often considered a mediator of anticipatory
   maternal effects; namely, mothers adjust maternal hormone transfer to
   prepare the offspring for the anticipated environment. The flexibility
   for mothers to adjust hormone transfer is therefore a prerequisite for
   such anticipatory maternal effects. Nevertheless, previous studies have
   focused only on the average differences of maternal hormone transfer
   between groups and neglected the substantial individual variation,
   despite the fact that individual plasticity in maternal hormone transfer
   is actually the central assumption. In this study, we studied the
   between- and within-individual variation of maternal thyroid hormones
   (THs) in egg yolk of wild great tits (Parus major) and estimated the
   individual plasticity of maternal yolk THs across environmental
   temperature, clutch initiation dates, and egg laying order using linear
   mixed effects models. Interestingly, our models provide statistical
   evidence that the two main THs-the main biologically active hormone T3
   and T4, which is mostly considered a prohormone-exhibited different
   variation patterns. Yolk T3 showed significant between-individual
   variation on the average levels, in line with its previously reported
   moderate heritability. Yolk T4, however, showed significant
   between-clutch variation in the pattern over the laying sequence,
   suggesting a great within-individual plasticity. Our findings suggest
   that the role and function of the hormone within the endocrine axis
   likely influences its flexibility to respond to environmental change.
   Whether the flexibility of T4 deposition brings a fitness advantage
   should be examined along with its potential effects on offspring, which
   remain to be further investigated.}},

Title = {{In ovo metabolism of progesterone to 5 beta-pregnanedione in chicken
   eggs: Implications for how yolk progesterone influences embryonic
   development}},
Journal = {{GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{282}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Progesterone has received substantial attention for the essential role
   it plays in establishing and maintaining pregnancy in placental
   vertebrates. Despite the prevalence of progesterone during development,
   relatively little is known about how embryos respond to progesterone.
   This is true of placental vertebrates as well as egg-laying vertebrates
   where levels of progesterone in the yolk tend to be higher than most
   other steroids in the yolk. Bird eggs provide an opportunity to
   investigate the effects of progesterone on embryonic development because
   progesterone can be easily manipulated without any confounding effects
   on maternal physiology. To understand how progesterone might influence
   embryonic development, it is important to characterize the metabolic
   fate of progesterone given its potential to be converted to a wide range
   of steroids. We investigated the metabolic fate of tritiated
   progesterone over the first four days of development using chicken eggs
   (Gallus gallus) and identified 5 beta-pregnanedione as the primary
   metabolite during this period. After only one day of development, 5
   beta-pregnanedione could be detected within the yolk. Levels of 5
   beta-pregnanedione in both the yolk and albumen tended to rise early in
   development but conjugated metabolites began to accumulate towards the
   end of our sampling period. Additionally, in vitro assays using embryo
   homogenates collected after 72 h of development demonstrated that
   embryos were capable of carrying out the conversion of progesterone to 5
   beta-pregnanedione. Overall these results have important implications
   for deciphering the mechanisms through which yolk progesterone might
   influence embryonic development. Effects could arise via progesterone
   receptors or receptors capable of binding 5 beta-pregnanedione but we
   found no evidence that progesterone is serving as a precursor for
   androgen or estrogen production.}},

Abstract = {{Maternally derived hormones are known to influence the growth and
   development of offspring. The differential deposition of these
   maternally derived hormones into egg yolk is one way by which females
   can alter their chicks' growth or survival. Yolk constituents,
   especially testosterone, have been described for a wide variety of
   species. However, few studies have focused on multiple maternally
   derived hormones regulated by independent axes in the endocrine system,
   and those studies that have, mainly focus on corticosterone and
   testosterone. In this study, within and among female variation in
   testosterone and triiodothyronine concentrations in egg yolks were
   measured in three free-living Franklin's Gull (Leucophaeus pipixcan)
   populations. Testosterone (T), but not triiodothyronine (T3),
   concentrations increase within a female's clutch such that eggs laid
   later in the clutch have increasingly higher concentrations (from a mean
   of 1.97 log pg T/mg yolk for the first egg to 2.98 log pg T/mg yolk for
   the third egg compared to a mean of 0.14 log pg T3/mg yolk for the first
   egg to 0.31 log pg T3/mg yolk for the third egg). Both testosterone and
   triiodothyronine concentrations increase among females across the
   breeding season such that eggs laid later in the season have
   significantly higher hormone concentrations (mean of 2.37 log pg T/mg
   yolk and mean of -0.03 log pg T3/mg yolk) than eggs laid early in the
   season (mean of 1.95 log pg T/mg yolk and mean of -0.17 log pg T3/mg

Journal = {{HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{Maternal corticosterone in avian eggs may modify offspring phenotype in
   order to increase survival in poor environments. In the Greater Rhea
   (Rhea americana), we previously found that yolk immunoreactive
   corticosterone is influenced by the quality of the maternal environment:
   eggs laid by females of the intensive rearing system (IRS), living in
   poor captive conditions, had higher yolk immunoreactive corticosterone
   than those produced by females of the semi-extensive rearing system
   (SRS), living in better conditions. Here, we evaluate if these different
   hormone levels are associated with the production of different
   phenotypes. We collected eggs from the IRS and SRS for hormonal
   quantification and artificial incubation. Then, half of the chicks
   selected from each environment were exposed to a capture and restraint
   protocol, and the rest remained undisturbed and were used as controls.
   In the IRS, we found that higher yolk immunoreactive corticosterone was
   associated with the production of chicks that had reduced hatchability,
   lower hatchling mass and higher baseline fecal glucocorticoid
   metabolites (FGM) than those produced by SRS females. Moreover, after
   capture and restraint, IRS chicks did not modify their FGM nor their
   behaviors compared to their controls, while SRS chicks increased their
   FGM and spent more time ambulating and less time pecking, compared to
   their controls. These results indicate that yolk immunoreactive
   corticosterone could modify offspring phenotype. Although future studies
   are needed to elucidate their implications for fitness, our results
   suggest that yolk corticosterone could be mediating an adaptive maternal
   effect that allows individuals to better cope with poor conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal and environmental effects can have profound effects on
   offspring performance by generating variation in offspring phenotypes,
   independent of genetic effects. Within avian broods, differential
   maternal investment of resources across the laying sequence is thought
   to be an adaptive strategy to modulate competitive hierarchies induced
   by hatching asynchrony. In this study, we evaluated the relative
   importance of maternally derived within-clutch variation and the
   asymmetric post-hatching environment for growth and survival of common
   tern (Sterna hirundo) siblings. We experimentally manipulated hatching
   order, resulting in chicks from last-laid eggs hatching first and vice
   versa. Although both initial age and size asymmetries were larger within
   experimental than control broods, the early survival of last-hatched
   chicks was similar between groups. Initial positive effects of egg size
   disappeared as siblings approached fledging. Ultimately at fledging,
   both within-brood growth and cumulative survival patterns were similar
   between experimental and control broods, suggesting that the effects of
   systematic variation of egg constituents (e.g., maternally derived yolk
   hormones) and egg size are too subtle and largely overwhelmed by the
   effects of hatching asynchrony. Therefore, we conclude that variation in
   offspring phenotypes is pre-dominantly determined by the social
   environment experienced post-hatching. Maternal effects may further
   fine-tune phenotypic variation in response to varying environmental
   conditions, but this needs to be tested through empirical studies in
   which multiple maternal effects are measured simultaneously under
   different environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypic effects of global warming have been documented in many
   different taxa. However, the importance of transgenerational phenotypic
   plasticity in these adaptations are seldom studied. In birds,
   temperature could affect egg characteristics. Higher temperatures during
   egg-laying may reduce maintenance costs for females and allow a higher
   investment in reproduction. Yet, females may also use temperatures as a
   cue for the risk of mismatch latter in the season. Thus, higher
   temperatures may be correlated to an acceleration of embryonic
   development (e.g. via hormonal manipulation). We performed an experiment
   in which night-time temperature was increased in the nestbox by
   approximately 1 degrees C throughout the entire laying period in great
   tits (Parus major). We collected one pre-treatment egg (beginning of the
   laying sequence) and one post-treatment egg (end of the laying
   sequence). Egg content (yolk androgens and lysozymes in the albumen),
   eggshell coloration, eggshell mass, egg mass, and shape were not
   affected by the treatment. However, last-laid eggs in clutches from
   control nestboxes had a thicker eggshell than last-laid eggs from heated
   nestboxes, suggesting a putative slight decrease of maternal investment
   with the experimental increase of temperature. We also observed effects
   of the laying sequence on egg characteristics. Eggs that were laid late
   in the laying sequence were heavier, larger, had larger spots and higher
   yolk androgens than eggs laid earlier. Lysozyme concentration decrease
   with the laying sequence in late clutches only. Thus, effects of
   temperature may also change with the laying sequence and it would be
   interesting in the future to tests the effects on first-laid eggs.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal hormones are thought to play an important role in determining
   the rate of evolutionary adaptation. Previous avian studies have shown
   that the transfer of maternally derived hormones, such as progesterone
   and testosterone, to the egg, affects many aspects of offspring
   development. In contrast, the impact of maternal corticosterone (CORT)
   is much less studied. CORT, the principal avian glucocorticoid hormone,
   is thought to be passively transferred to the egg yolk from the maternal
   plasma. Maternal CORT may play a role in determining the development of
   young birds by adaptively programming offspring for their environment.
   We developed a protocol which effectively quantifies yolk CORT
   concentrations both within and across clutches, using solid-phase
   extraction and radioimmunoassay. We hypothesised that Gouldian Finch
   (Erythrura gouldiae) mothers would differ in their yolk CORT
   concentrations and that maternal condition would relate to absolute yolk
   CORT deposition. We found variation in yolk CORT concentrations between
   clutches, whilst yolk CORT increased with egg number in the first
   breeding season and negatively correlated with yolk mass. Yet, contrary
   to our predictions, neither maternal mass nor clutch size showed any
   relationship to yolk CORT concentrations or to egg or yolk mass. Our
   data suggest that yolk CORT varies with maternal identity for reasons
   which do not appear to be linked to maternal condition. Further research
   is needed to determine the link between maternal and egg yolk
   concentrations at the individual level. Such tests would be valuable for
   understanding the role of CORT in the reproductive effects previously
   observed in this threatened species.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY}},

Number = {{8}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Eggs are `multivariate' in that they contain multiple maternally derived
   egg components (e.g. hormones, antibodies, mRNA, antioxidants) which are
   thought to influence offspring phenotype. However, most studies have
   focused on single egg components and on short-term effects. Here, we
   simultaneously manipulated two egg components, maternally derived
   antibodies (MAb) and yolk testosterone, to assess potential synergistic
   or antagonistic effects on zebra finch offspring phenotype from hatching
   to sexual maturity. We found no evidence for short- or long-term effects
   of either MAb or yolk testosterone alone, or their interaction, on
   hatching mass, size at fledging (tarsus length), body mass at sexual
   maturity (day 82), chick survival, humoral immune function or any
   measured female reproductive trait at sexual maturity. There was a
   positive effect of yolk testosterone, but not MAb, on offspring
   phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) response at 26 days of age but at 82 days of
   age. MAb, but not yolk testosterone, had a positive effect on PHA
   response. There was also a MAbxsex interaction on 30 day chick mass, and
   a positive effect of yolk testosterone on male courtship behaviour at
   sexual maturity. However, we found no evidence for synergy, i.e. where
   offspring treated with both MAb and yolk testosterone had higher trait
   values than offspring treated with either MAb or yolk testosterone alone
   for any measured trait. Similarly, evidence for antagonistic
   (compensatory) effects, where offspring treated with both MAb and yolk
   testosterone had intermediate trait values compared with offspring
   treated with either MAID or yolk testosterone alone, was equivocal.}},

Year = {{2019}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Several studies show effects of yolk androgens in avian eggs on the
   phenotype of the offspring. Yolk hormone concentrations decline strongly
   within the first few days of incubation. Although early embryonic uptake
   of yolk androgens is suggested by the presence of radioactivity in the
   embryo when eggs are injected with radiolabelled androgens, these
   studies do not verify the chemical identity of radioactive compound(s),
   although it is known that these androgens can be metabolized
   substantially. By using stable isotopelabelled testosterone and
   androstenedione in combination with mass spectrometry, enabling
   verification of the exact molecular identity of labelled compounds in
   the embryo, we found that after 5 days of incubation the androgens were
   not taken up by the embryo. However, their concentrations in the entire
   yolk albumen homogenates declined strongly, even when corrected for
   dilution by albumen and water. Our results indicate metabolism of
   maternal androgens, very likely to 5 beta-androstane-3 alpha,17
   beta-diol, etiocholanolone and their conjugated forms. The results imply
   that the effects of increased exposure of the embryo to maternal
   androgens take place either before this early conversion or are mediated
   by these metabolites with an as yet unknown function, opening newavenues
   for understanding hormone-mediated maternal effects in vertebrates.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{247}},
Pages = {{725-735}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) include a wide array of
   pollutants, such as some metals and other toxic elements, which may
   cause changes in hormonal homeostasis. In addition to affecting
   physiology of individuals directly, EDCs may alter the transfer of
   maternal hormones to offspring, i.e. causing trans-generational
   endocrine disruption. However, such effects have been rarely studied,
   especially in wild populations. We studied the associations between
   environmental elemental pollution (As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb) and
   maternally-derived egg thyroid hormones (THs) as well as nestling THs in
   great tits (Parus major) using extensive sampling of four pairs of
   polluted and reference populations across Europe (Finland, Belgium,
   Hungary, Portugal). Previous studies in these populations showed that
   breeding success, nestling growth and adult and nestling physiology were
   altered in polluted zones compared to reference zones. We sampled
   non-incubated eggs to measure maternally-derived egg THs, measured
   nestling plasma THs and used nestling faeces for assessing local
   elemental exposure. We also studied whether the effect of elemental
   pollution on endocrine traits is dependent on calcium (Ca) availability
   (faecal Ca as a proxy) as low Ca increases toxicity of some elements.
   Birds in the polluted zones were exposed to markedly higher levels of
   toxic elements than in reference zones at the populations in Finland,
   Belgium and Hungary. In contrast to our predictions, we did not find any
   associations between overall elemental pollution, or individual element
   concentrations and egg TH and nestling plasma TH levels. However, we
   found some indication that the effect of metals (Cd and Cu) on egg THs
   is dependent on Ca availability. In summary, our results suggest that
   elemental pollution at the studied populations is unlikely to cause
   overall TH disruption and affect breeding via altered egg or nestling TH
   levels with the current elemental pollution loads. Associations with Ca
   availability should be further studied. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Regular visual presence of humans is known to reduce chickens'
   human-generated stress responses. Here we questioned whether, more than
   mere visual presence, human behaviour affects laying hen behaviour and
   subsequently their offspring's behaviour. We hypothesized that human
   behaviour triggers maternal effects via variations in yolk hormone
   levels. For five consecutive weeks, two groups of hens were exposed to
   the same durations of human presence (30 min twice a day, five days a
   week) but the behaviour of the human differed between groups. The first
   group (H +) was exposed to predictable arrival of the experimenter, slow
   movements combined with static presence, stroking daring handling and
   human voice. Whereas the second group of hens (H-) was exposed to
   unpredictable arrival of the experimenter which remained silent, in
   motion, and did not provide stroking during handling. At the end of the
   treatment, we evaluated egg quality and offspring behaviour. We found
   that avoidance of the experimenter by H+ hens but not by H- hens
   decreased significantly. Fertility rates and concentrations of yolk
   progesterone and estradiol in H + hens' eggs were higher than in H-
   hens' eggs. Fear of humans, neophobia or the capacity to solve a detour
   task did not differ significantly between H+ and Hchicks. Social
   discrimination tests showed that H+ chicks but not Fl- chicks typically
   preferred a familiar conspecific to a stranger. These results show that,
   with the same duration in the presence of the birds, humans through
   their behaviour engender variations in fertility rates, yolk hormone
   levels and transgenerational effects on social skills. Rarely explored,
   our data suggest that maternal effects influence filial imprinting.
   These data have broad implications for laboratory, commercial systems
   and conservatory programs where the inevitable presence of humans could
   trigger maternal effects on offspring phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Parental experience with predators can modify survival- and
   reproduction-related traits of offspring via parental effects. Direct
   predation risk elevates glucocorticoid concentration in the eggs of
   females, and so indirect predation risk communicated via parental
   effects may also affect glucocorticoids in the eggs of daughters.
   Parents may also change their care patterns under predation risk, which
   could influence the development of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal
   axis (stress axis) of offspring, which is responsible for the secretion
   of glucocorticoids. Therefore, in systems where males make substantial
   contributions to offspring care, paternal effects may also affect
   daughters' egg glucocorticoids.
   Question: Are there predator-induced parental effects (maternal,
   paternal, or joint parental effects) on the concentration of
   glucocorticoids in daughters' eggs?
   Organism: Threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from the
   Chehalis River, Washington, USA. Freshwater and riverine ecotypes.
   Methods: We exposed threespine stickleback mothers, fathers, both, or
   neither to a model predator at developmentally appropriate times using a
   fully factorial design. Control parents experienced no disturbance.
   Mothers were exposed to a model predator during egg production and
   fathers were exposed pre-fertilization and during egg care (but before
   embryos developed eyes). We then tested the concentration of
   glucocorticoids in the eggs of daughters using an enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
   Results: Daughters of predator-exposed parents (both parents exposed to
   model predator) had higher glucocorticoid concentrations in their eggs
   than daughters of control, unexposed parents. Daughters of
   predator-exposed mothers-only and predator-exposed fathers-only did not
   differ from controls or jointly predator-exposed parents. Therefore,
   predator-induced maternal and paternal effects may cumulatively impact
   the gametes of their daughters, suggesting a mechanism through which
   predation risk may indirectly influence the next generation
   (grand-offspring).}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Maternal thyroid hormones (THs) have been proven crucial for embryonic
   development in humans, but their influence within the natural variation
   on wild animals remains unknown. So far the only two studies that
   experimentally investigated the potential fitness consequences of
   maternal THs in birds found inconsistent results. More studies are thus
   required to assess the general effects of maternal THs and their
   influences on more behavioral and physiological parameters. In this
   study, we experimentally elevated yolk TH content in a wild migratory
   passerine species, the collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis, to
   investigate the effects on hatching success, nestling growth and
   oxidative stress. We found that TH-injected eggs had a higher hatching
   success, and the nestlings hatched from TH-injected eggs were heavier
   and larger than control nestlings, but only during the early postnatal
   period. These differences vanished by fledging. Nestlings from
   TH-injected eggs exhibited lower activity of the
   glutathione-s-transferase, a major antioxidant enzyme, than control
   nestlings at day 12, a few days before fledging, but they did not differ
   in oxidative damage and overall intracellular oxidative state. These
   results suggest that the early growth-enhancing effects incurred no
   observable oxidative stress. We hypothesize that such a transient
   growth-enhancing effect might be adaptive in advancing the development
   and maturation of the offspring so they are well-prepared in time for
   the upcoming migration. Further studies investigating whether such
   advancing effects can influence long-term fitness, will be more than
   valuable.}},

Abstract = {{Steroid hormones play critical organizational and activational roles
   during vertebrate development, impacting everything from sexual
   differentiation to metabolic activity. For oviparous species such as
   birds, these hormones are transferred from female to egg during follicle
   maturation, and differences in relative and absolute concentrations of
   the steroid hormones may reflect differences in life history,
   developmental, and ecological conditions. Prior work on yolk steroid
   hormones has focused on a handful of candidate hormones (e.g.,
   testosterone, androstenedione, and corticosterone), but we used
   high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy
   (LC-MS-MS) to quantify 27 yolk steroids from the eggs of seven shrubland
   bird species (American Robin, Turdus migratorius Linnaeus, 1766;
   Brown-headed Cowbird, Molothrus ater (Boddaert, 1783); Brown Thrasher,
   Toxostoma rufum (Linnaeus, 1758); Eastern Towhee, Pipilo
   erythrophthalmus (Linnaeus, 1758); Field Sparrow, Spizella pusilla (A.
   Wilson, 1810); Gray Catbird, Dumetella carolinensis (Linnaeus, 1766);
   Northern Cardinal, Cardinalis cardinalis (Linnaeus, 1758)). In addition
   to comparing steroid profiles across species, we conducted exploratory
   analyses to determine how the hormones clustered using a principal
   component (PC) approach and if PCs were correlated with aspects of egg
   resources (relative egg size, proportion yolk), life-history traits
   (embryonic and nestling development speed), and nest-predation risk
   (daily survival rate (DSR)). We documented substantial interspecific
   variation in both absolute and proportional endocrine profiles. PCAs
   indicated that glucocorticoids generally clustered together (PC1), but
   other classes of steroids did not. PC2 and PC3 strongly covaried with
   egg resources, DSR, and development speed, suggesting that they reflect
   adaptive patterns of maternal hormone deposition.}},

Abstract = {{Vertebrate embryos are exposed to maternal hormones that can profoundly
   affect their later phenotype. Although it is known that the embryo can
   metabolize these maternal hormones, the metabolic outcomes, their
   quantitative dynamics and timing are poorly understood. Moreover, it is
   unknown whether embryos can adjust their metabolic activity to, for
   example, hormones or other maternal signals. We studied the dynamics of
   maternal steroids in fertilized and unfertilized rock pigeon eggs during
   early incubation. Embryos of this species are naturally exposed to
   different amounts of maternal steroids in the egg according to their
   laying position, which provides a natural context to study differential
   embryonic regulation of the maternal signals. We used mass spectrometric
   analyses to map changes in the androgen and estrogen pathways of
   conversion. We show that the active hormones are heavily metabolized
   only in fertilized eggs, with a corresponding increase in supposedly
   less potent metabolites already within one-fourth of total incubation
   period. Interestingly, the rate of androgen metabolism was different
   between embryos in different laying positions. The results also warrant
   a re-interpretation of the timing of hormone mediated maternal effects
   and the role of the supposedly biologically inactive metabolites.
   Furthermore, the results also provide a potential solution as to how the
   embryo can prevent maternal steroids in the egg from interfering with
   its sexual differentiation processes as we show that the embryo can
   metabolize most of the maternal steroids before sexual differentiation
   starts.}},

Abstract = {{While biomedical researchers have long appreciated the influence of
   maternally derived glucocorticoids (GCs) on offspring phenotype,
   ecologists have only recently begun exploring its impact in wild
   animals. Interpreting biomedical findings within an ecological context
   has posited that maternal stress, mediated by elevations of maternal
   GCs, may play an adaptive role preparing offspring for a stressful or
   rigorous environment. Yet, the influence of maternal stress on offspring
   phenotype has been little studied in wild animals. We experimentally
   elevated GCs to ecologically relevant levels (mimicking increases in
   maternal stress hormones following a nonlethal predator encounter, a
   heat challenge, or a chasing or confinement stressor) in female eastern
   fence lizards Sceloporus undulatus during gestation. We tested the
   hypothesis that maternally derived stress hormones themselves are
   sufficient to alter offspring phenotype. Specifically, we examined the
   effects of experimentally elevated maternal GCs on fitness-relevant
   traits of the mother, her eggs and her subsequent offspring. We found
   that daily maternal GC elevation: (a) increased maternal antipredator
   behaviours and postlaying glucose levels; (b) had no effect on egg
   morphology or caloric value, but altered yolk hormone (elevated GC) and
   nutrient content; and (c) altered offspring phenotype including
   stress-relevant physiology, morphology and behaviour. These findings
   reveal that maternally derived GCs alone can alter offspring phenotype
   in a wild animal, changes that may be mediated via maternal behaviour,
   and egg hormone and nutrient content. Understanding the ecological
   consequences of these effects under different environmental conditions
   will be critical for determining the adaptive significance of elevated
   maternal GCs for offspring.}},

Title = {{Evidence of embryonic regulation of maternally derived yolk
   corticosterone}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{221}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, the potential for maternal stress effects to adaptively
   alter offspring phenotype has received considerable attention. This
   research has identified offspring traits that are labile in response to
   maternal stress; however, an understanding of the mechanisms underlying
   these effects is lagging and is crucial to appreciating the significance
   of this maternal effect. In the present study, we sought to better
   understand maternal stress effects by examining the potential for
   embryonic regulation of corticosterone exposure, determining the
   phenotypic consequences of elevated corticosterone during development,
   and characterizing the levels of maternally transferred corticosterone
   in unmanipulated eggs using Trachemys scripta. By dosing eggs with
   tritiated corticosterone and tracking the steroid throughout
   development, we found that most corticosterone is metabolized, and less
   than 1\% of the corticosterone dose reaches the embryo as free
   corticosterone. We also found that exogenous dosing of corticosterone,
   in concentrations sufficient to overwhelm embryonic metabolism, reduces
   embryonic survival and negatively impacts hatchling traits important to
   fitness. Our results demonstrate that concentrations of maternal
   corticosterone in the yolks of unmanipulated eggs are low and are
   significantly lower than the doses of corticosterone required to elicit
   phenotypic effects in hatchlings. Taken together, these results provide
   evidence that both the embryo and the female may minimize corticosterone
   accumulation in the embryo to avoid reductions in embryonic survival and
   negative impacts on offspring phenotype and fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Steroid hormones are important mediators of prenatal maternal effects in
   animals. Despite a growing number of studies involving experimental
   manipulation of these hormones, little is known about the impact of
   methodological differences among experiments on the final results
   expressed as offspring traits. Using a meta-analytical approach and a
   representative sample of experimental studies performed on birds, we
   tested the effect of two types of direct hormonal manipulations:
   manipulation of females (either by implantation of hormone pellets or
   injection of hormonal solutions) and manipulation of eggs by injection.
   In both types of manipulation we looked at the effects of two groups of
   hormones: corticosterone and androgens in the form of testosterone and
   androstenedione. We found that the average effect on offspring traits
   differed between the manipulation types, with a well-supported positive
   effect of egg manipulation and lack of a significant effect of maternal
   manipulation. The observed average positive effect for egg manipulation
   was driven mainly by androgen manipulations, while corticosterone
   manipulations exerted no overall effect, regardless of manipulation
   type. Detailed analyses revealed effects of varying size and direction
   depending on the specific offspring traits; e.g., egg manipulation
   positively affected physiology and behaviour (androgens), and negatively
   affected future reproduction (corticosterone). Effect size was
   negatively related to the dose of androgen injected into the eggs, but
   unrelated to timing of manipulation, offspring developmental stage at
   the time of measuring their traits, solvent type, the site of egg
   injection and maternal hormone delivery method. Despite the generally
   acknowledged importance of maternal hormones for offspring development
   in birds, the overall effect of their experimental elevation is rather
   weak, significantly heterogeneous and dependent on the hormone and type
   of manipulation. We conclude by providing general recommendations as to
   how hormonal manipulations should be performed in order to standardize
   their impact and the results achieved. We also emphasize the need for
   research on free-living birds with a focus on fitness-related and other
   long-term effects of maternal hormones.}},

   maternal allocation}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUL 25}},
Abstract = {{Maternal hormones deposited in the egg can provide a powerful model for
   the study of maternal effects. The differential amount of maternal
   hormones in the yolk of freshly laid eggs is assumed to represent
   differential maternal allocation. However, some evidence suggests that
   these amounts do not reflect maternal allocation that in fact takes
   place before ovulation. We compared the amounts of a wide array of
   gonadal steroids and their metabolites in the yolk of pre-ovulatory
   follicles with those of freshly laid eggs of rock pigeons using mass
   spectrometry. We found that between the follicle and egg stages the
   levels of progesterone increase whereas androstenedione and testosterone
   decrease in which the strength of decrease was dependent on the laying
   order of the egg. For conjugated estrone the change between follicle and
   egg differed in direction for first and second laying position yielding
   a significant interaction effect. For conjugated testosterone the
   interaction did not reach but was close to significance. This extremely
   early steroid metabolism was not due to maternal enzymes in the yolk as
   indicated by incubation of pre-ovulatory yolks treated with
   proteinase-K, a protein digesting enzyme. The results have significant
   consequences for the functional and evolutionary interpretation as well
   as experimental manipulation of hormone-mediated maternal effects.}},

Abstract = {{While the general patterns of age-specific changes in reproductive
   success are quitewell established in long-lived animals, we still do not

   related to maternal age. We measured the levels of yolk testosterone,

   gulls (Larus canus) and found an age-specific pattern in yolk lutein and
   vitamin A concentrations. Middle-aged mothers allocated more of these
   substances to yolk compared to young and old mothers. These results can
   be explained through differences in age-specific foraging, absorption or
   deposition patterns of carotenoids and vitamins into yolk. If these
   molecules play a role in antioxidant defence and immune modulation, our
   results suggest a possible physiological pathway underlying the

Abstract = {{Inter- and intraspecific variation in eggshell colouration has long
   fascinated evolutionary biologists. Among species, such variation may
   accomplish different functions, the most obvious of which is camouflage
   and background matching. Within species, it has been proposed that
   inter-female variation in eggshell pigmentation patterns can reflect
   egg, maternal or paternal traits and hence may provide cues to
   conspecifics about egg, maternal or paternal phenotypic quality.
   However, the relationship between protoporphyrin-based eggshell
   pigmentation and egg or maternal/paternal traits appears to be highly
   variable among species. We investigated patterns of intraspecific
   variation in Eurasian barn swallow Hirundo r. rustica
   protoporphyrin-based eggshell pigmentation, and analysed its association
   with egg and clutch characteristics, maternal/paternal phenotypic traits
   and parental feeding effort. Eggshell pigmentation pattern significantly
   varied between breeding colonies, was significantly repeatable in first
   clutches laid by the same females in different years (intraclass
   correlation coefficient ranging between 0.56 and 0.63), but it was not
   significantly associated with egg traits, such as position in the laying
   sequence, egg mass, yolk testosterone concentration and antioxidant
   capacity. It was weakly or non-significantly associated with female and
   male traits (sexual ornaments), but females laying darker (higher
   pigment intensity) first clutches had higher hatching success,
   suggesting that eggshell pigment intensity may predict fitness. Male
   nestling feeding effort was not predicted by eggshell pigmentation. In
   addition, females with darker breast plumage colouration (a
   melanin-based trait related to fitness) laid highly
   protoporphyrin-covered eggs, suggesting the presence of a previously
   unappreciated link between protoporphyrin biosynthesis and plumage
   melanisation. Moreover, the proportion of male offspring increased in
   clutches originating from highly protoporphyrin-covered eggs, suggesting
   that parents could acquire visual cues about their future brood sex
   composition before egg hatching. Our results support the idea that
   intraspecific signalling via eggshell pigmentation is a species-specific
   rather than a general feature of avian taxa.}},

Title = {{In ovo yolk carotenoid and testosterone levels interactively influence
   female transfer of yolk antioxidants to her eggs}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Mothers can influence prenatal conditions by varying the amount of
   nutrients, hormones or antioxidants they provide to their developing
   young. Some of these substances even affect the transfer of these
   compounds in the next generation, but it is less clear how different
   maternally transmitted compounds interact with each other to shape
   reproductive resource allocation in their offspring. Here, we found that
   female Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica) that were exposed to high
   carotenoid levels during embryonic development transferred lower
   concentrations of yolk antioxidants to their own eggs later in life.
   This effect disappeared when both testosterone and carotenoid
   concentrations were manipulated simultaneously, showing long-term and
   interactive effects of these maternally derived egg components on a
   female's own egg composition. Given that exposure to high levels of
   testosterone during embryo development stimulates the production of
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impairs antioxidant defenses, we
   propose that carotenoids act as in ovo antioxidants in an oxidatively
   stressful environment (i.e. when levels of testosterone are high) but
   might have prooxidant properties in an environment where they are not
   used to counteract an increased production of ROS. In line with this
   hypothesis, we previously showed that prenatal exposure to increased
   concentrations of yolk carotenoids leads to a rise of oxidative damage
   at adulthood, but only when yolk testosterone concentrations were not
   experimentally increased as well. As a consequence, antioxidants in the
   body may be used to limit oxidative damage in females exposed to high
   levels of carotenoids during development (but not in females exposed to
   increased levels of both carotenoids and testosterone), resulting in
   lower amounts of antioxidants being available for deposition into eggs.
   Since prenatal antioxidant exposure is known to influence
   fitness-related traits, the effect detected in this study might have
   transgenerational consequences.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal effects are currently acknowledged as important causes of
   transgenerational phenotypic variation and a potential mechanism to
   adapt offspring to predicted environments, thus having a pivotal role in
   ecology and evolution. Research in hormonal mechanism underlying
   maternal effects has focused heavily on steroid hormones. Other
   hormones, such as thyroid hormones (THs; thyroxine and
   triiodothyronine), have been largely ignored in ecological research
   until recently. We summarize the recent findings, identify knowledge
   gaps, and provide future research directions investigating the role of
   TH-mediated maternal effects in ecological context across taxa.
   Surprisingly, data on the sources of naturally occurring variation in
   maternal THs and their fitness effects are lacking in most vertebrate
   taxa. There is considerable variation in maternal TH levels in eggs
   across taxa. Avian egg THs show heritable variation, and data from fish
   and amphibians suggest female consistency in egg TH levels. In birds,
   variation in maternal THs was associated with important ecological
   factors, such as food availability and temperature. THs also showed
   intraindividual variation varying systematically within clutches.
   Importantly, exposure to maternal THs within naturally occurring range
   affected offspring fitness-related traits (growth and survival) in birds
   and fish. These findings make THs an interesting mechanism underlying
   maternal effects, which likely shape offspring phenotypes.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Maternal hormones can be transferred to offspring during prenatal
   development in response to the maternal social environment, and may
   adaptively alter offspring phenotype. For example, numerous avian
   studies show that aggressive competition with conspecifics tends to
   result in females allocating more testosterone to their egg yolks, and
   this may cause offspring to have more competitive phenotypes. However,
   deviations from this pattern of maternal testosterone allocation are
   found, largely in studies of colonial species, and have yet to be
   explained. Colonial species may have different life-history constraints
   causing different yolk testosterone allocation strategies in response to
   conspecific competition, but few studies have experimentally tested
   whether colonial species do indeed differ from that of solitary species.
   To test this, we collected eggs from zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata,
   a colonial species, in the presence and absence of conspecific
   intrusions. Females did not alter the concentration of testosterone
   deposited in eggs laid during intrusions despite becoming more
   aggressive. These results suggest that maternal effects are not
   characterized by a uniform response to the social environment, but
   rather need to be contextualized with life-history traits.}},

Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{220-233}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Maternal effects can provide offspring with reliable information about
   the environment they are likely to experience, but also offer scope for
   maternal manipulation of young when interests diverge between parents
   and offspring. To predict the impact of parent-offspring conflict, we
   model the evolution of maternal effects on local adaptation of young. We
   find that parent-offspring conflict strongly influences the stability of
   maternal effects; moreover, the nature of the disagreement between
   parents and young predicts how conflict is resolved: when mothers favor
   less extreme mixtures of phenotypes relative to offspring (i.e., when
   mothers stand to gain by hedging their bets), mothers win the conflict
   by providing offspring with limited amounts of information. When
   offspring favor overproduction of one and the same phenotype across all
   environments compared to mothers (e.g., when offspring favor a larger
   body size), neither side wins the conflict and signaling breaks down.
   Only when offspring favor less extreme mixtures relative to their
   mothers (something no current model predicts), offspring win the
   conflict and obtain full information about the environment. We conclude
   that a partial or complete breakdown of informative maternal effects
   will be the norm rather than the exception in the presence of
   parent-offspring conflict.}},

Abstract = {{Differential transfer of maternal testosterone (T) into egg yolk
   provides a means of adjusting an offspring's phenotype to ambient
   environmental conditions. While the environmental and genetic driven
   variability in yolk T levels is widely described, the underlying
   mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we investigated whether
   neuroendocrine mechanisms controlling ovulatory processes are associated
   with the regulation of yolk T deposition. Circulatory profiles of
   luteinizing hormone (LH), T and estradiol levels were analysed during
   the last 7 h before ovulation in Japanese quail selected for contrasting
   yolk T concentrations. Moreover, the pituitary responsiveness to a
   single challenge with gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) was
   evaluated. High egg T (HET) birds displayed higher concentrations of LH
   at 3.5 h before ovulation than low egg T (LET) birds while no
   differences were found around the time of expected ovulation. The
   pre-ovulatory profile of and estradiol levels did not differ between LET
   and HET females but pre-ovulatory plasma T positively correlated with LH
   concentrations at 6.5 h and 3.5 h before ovulation. The LH response to
   GnRH did not differ between LET and HET females. Our results demonstrate
   that the pre-ovulatory LH surge can determine the amount of T
   transferred into the egg yolk. This link between yolk T deposition and
   the ovulatory cycle driven variation of reproductive hormones may
   explain balance between the effects of circulating T on female's
   reproductive physiology and yolk T on offspring phenotype. (C) 2017 The

Abstract = {{Sex allocation is the parental resource allocation to sons versus
   daughters. Given the different benefits and costs of investments in sons
   and daughters, females should adjust the brood sex ratio according to
   their own quality to maximize their fitness. In the barn swallow Hirundo
   rustica, as in many other passerines, females should increase the
   proportion of sons in their broods with increasing maternal body size,
   because rearing sons is particularly costly to small females with low
   feeding capacity, and because reproductive success in the barn swallow,
   which may depend on rearing conditions, varies more in males. However,
   evidence supporting this prediction is lacking, even in this model
   species of sex allocation. Using the Asian subspecies of the barn
   swallow H. r. gutturalis, we confirmed this prediction. Larger mothers
   with a longer keel had more sons in their brood. We found that male
   nestlings invested more in pheomelanin pigmentation compared with female
   nestlings, while they had shorter wing lengths, indicating that male
   nestlings are costly to rear compared with female nestlings. Smaller
   mothers that are at a disadvantage in provisioning may not retard the
   nestling period by producing daughters, which reduces their parental
   investment and thus saves their residual reproductive value. This
   breeding strategy might be particularly beneficial to Japanese barn
   swallows that breed in environments with high nest predation.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{121-127}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Behavioral lateralization is widespread across vertebrates. The
   development of lateralization is affected by both genetic and
   environmental factors. In birds, maternal substances in the egg can
   affect offspring lateralization via activational and/or organizational
   effects. Corticosterone affects the development of brain asymmetry,
   suggesting that variation in yolk corticosterone concentration may also
   influence post-natal behavioral lateralization, a hypothesis that has
   never been tested so far. In the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis),
   we increased yolk corticosterone concentration within physiological
   limits and analyzed the direction of lateralization of hatchlings in
   reverting from supine to prone position ('RTP' response) and in pecking
   at dummy parental bills to solicit food provisioning ('begging'
   response). We found that corticosterone treatment negatively affected
   the frequency of begging and it may cause a slight leftward
   lateralization. However, the direction of lateralization of the RTP
   response was not affected by corticosterone administration. Thus, our
   study shows a maternal effect mediated by corticosterone on a behavioral
   trait involved in parent-offspring communication during food
   provisioning events. The findings on lateralization are not conclusive
   due to the weak effect size but provide information for further
   ecological and evolutionary studies, investigating mechanisms underlying
   the development of lateralization.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual dimorphism in prenatal development is widespread among
   vertebrates, including birds. Its mechanism remains unclear, although it
   has been attributed to the effect of maternal steroid hormones. The aim
   of this study was to investigate how increased levels of steroid
   hormones in the eggs influence early embryonic development of male and
   female offspring. We also asked whether maternal hormones take part in
   the control of sex-specific expression of the genes involved in prenatal
   development. We experimentally manipulated hormones' concentrations in
   the egg yolk by injecting zebra finch females prior to ovulation with
   testosterone or corticosterone. We assessed growth rate and expression
   levels of CDK7, FBP1 and GHR genes in 37 h-old embryos. We found faster
   growth and higher expression of two studied genes in male compared to
   female embryos. Hormonal treatment, despite clearly differentiating egg
   steroid levels, had no effect on the sex-specific pattern of the
   embryonic gene expression, even though we confirmed expression of
   receptors of androgens and glucocorticoids at such an early stage of
   development. Thus, our study shows high stability of the early sex
   differences in the embryonic development before the onset of sexual
   differentiation and indicates their independence of maternal hormones in
   the egg. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In oscines, male song stimulates female reproduction and females are
   known to adjust both their sexual preferences and their maternal
   investment according to song quality. Female domestic canaries are
   especially responsive to wide frequency bandwidth (4 kHz) male songs
   emitted with a high-repetition syllable rate and low minimal frequencies
   (1 kHz). We previously showed that low-frequency urban noise decreases
   female sexual responsiveness for these low-frequency songs (1-5 kHz)
   through auditory masking. Based on the differential allocation
   hypothesis, we predicted that urban noise exposure will equally affect
   female maternal investment. Using a crossover design, we broadcast
   low-frequency songs to females either in an overlapping noise condition
   or in an alternating noise condition. Females decreased both their
   sexual responsiveness and their clutch size in the overlapping noise
   treatment relative to the alternative noise treatment. No differences
   were found concerning egg size or egg composition (yolk and albumen
   mass, testosterone concentration). Due to our experimental design, we
   can exclude a general impact of noisy conditions and thereby provide
   evidence for a detrimental effect through masking on avian courtship and
   reproductive output. These results suggest that noisy conditions may
   also affect avian communication in outdoor conditions, which may partly
   explain field reports on noise-dependent breeding success and reduced
   breeding densities at noisy sites.}},

Abstract = {{In many birds, hatching asynchrony is a common phenomenon, primarily
   driven by patterns of incubation behaviour. However, experimental
   results in blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) have shown that asynchrony is
   reduced by intrinsic properties of later eggs that accelerate prenatal
   development.
   These intrinsic differences between early and late eggs could be driven
   by changes in resource availability to females, which are then passively
   passed onto the egg. Alternatively, it may be due to an anticipatory
   maternal effect, wherein some signal or resource is actively placed
   within the egg, which is beneficial to those eggs laid late within the
   clutch.
   In order to distinguish between these hypotheses we designed a
   supplementary feeding experiment, wherein females were provided with
   food at certain times during the laying phase. This had no discernible
   effect on development rate, or other egg characteristics, consistent
   with anticipatory maternal effects.
   Using a larger dataset we also tested whether natural environmental
   variation (weather) during egg formation affected maternal investment in
   eggs. Similarly, egg characteristics were found to be relatively
   insensitive to the environmental variation, supporting the experimental
   results.}},

Abstract = {{In species with biparental care, there is sexual conflict as each parent
   is under selection to minimize its personal effort by shifting as much
   as possible of the workload over to the other parent. Most theoretical
   and empirical work on the resolution of this conflict has focused on
   strategies used by both parents, such as negotiation. However, because
   females produce the eggs, this might afford females with an ability to
   manipulate male behavior via maternal effects that alter offspring
   phenotypes. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated the prenatal
   conditions (i.e., presence or absence of the male), performed a
   cross-fostering experiment, and monitored the subsequent effects of
   prenatal conditions on offspring and parental performance in the burying
   beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. We found that offspring were smaller at
   hatching when females laid eggs in presence of a male, suggesting that
   females invest less in eggs when expecting male assistance. Furthermore,
   broods laid in the presence of a male gained more weight during parental
   care, and they did so at the expense of male weight gain. Contrary to
   our expectations, males cared less for broods laid in the presence of a
   male. Our results provide experimental evidence that females can alter
   male behavior during breeding by adjusting maternal effects according to
   prenatal conditions. However, rather than increasing the male's parental
   effort, females appeared to suppress the male's food consumption,
   thereby leaving more food for their brood.}},

Abstract = {{Brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) deposit their eggs into the nests
   of other birds, which then raise the cowbird chick. Female cowbirds thus
   have limited options for impacting their offspring's development via
   maternal effects compared to most other passerines. Cowbirds can impact
   their offspring's phenotype by choosing among potential host nests, and
   by adjusting egg resources based on host characteristics. To examine
   whether cowbirds exhibit either or both of these strategies, we
   investigated rates of cowbird parasitism and egg investment (egg size,
   yolk-to-albumen ratio, and yolk testosterone and androstenedione) among
   and within host species in a shrubland bird community. We found that the
   probability of being parasitized by cowbirds, controlling for host
   status as a cowbird egg accepter or rejecter and ordinal date, varied
   significantly among host species, indicating an apparent preference for
   some hosts. Parasitism rates did not differ with host size, however, and
   despite variation in cowbird egg size among host species, this variation
   was not related to host size or cowbird preference. Among host species
   with eggs that are larger than those of the cowbird, cowbirds were
   significantly more likely to parasitize nests with relatively smaller

Abstract = {{We assessed whether the ratio of dietary n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty
   acids (PUFA) during egg formation engenders transgenerational maternal
   effects in domestic chicks. We analyzed yolk lipid and hormone
   concentrations, and HPA-axis activity in hens fed a control diet (high
   n-6/n-3 ratio) or a diet enriched in n-3 PUFAs (low n-6/n-3 ratio) for 6
   consecutive weeks. Their chicks were tested for neophobia during the
   first week of life. We found higher corticosterone metabolites in
   droppings of hens fed the diet enriched in n-3 and significantly higher
   concentrations of yolk progesterone, androstenedione, and estradiol in
   their eggs compared to controls. Chicks of hens fed the n-3 enriched
   diet showed a lower body mass at hatch than controls and expressed
   higher neophobia when exposed to a novel object. These results add
   support to the hypothesis that the nutritional state of female birds
   produces variation in yolk hormone levels and engender maternal effects.}},

Abstract = {{1. Sex-specific maternal effects can be adaptive sources of phenotypic
   plasticity. Reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD)
   are a powerful system to investigate such maternal effects because
   offspring phenotype, including sex, can be sensitive to maternal
   influences such as oestrogens and incubation temperatures. 2. In
   red-eared slider turtles (Trachemys scripta), concentrations of
   maternally derived oestrogens and incubation temperatures increase
   across the nesting season; we wanted to determine if sex ratios shift in
   a seasonally concordant manner, creating the potential for sex-specific
   maternal effects, and to define the sex ratio reaction norms under
   fluctuating temperatures across the nesting season. 3. Eggs from early
   and late season clutches were incubated under a range of thermally
   fluctuating temperatures, maternally derived oestradiol concentrations
   were quantified via radioimmunoassay, and hatchling sex was identified.
   We found that late-season eggs had higher maternal oestrogen
   concentrations and were more likely to produce female hatchlings. The
   sex ratio reaction norm curves systematically varied with season, such
   that with even a slight increase in temperature (05 degrees C),
   late-season eggs produced up to 49\% more females than early-season
   eggs. 4. We found a seasonal shift in sex ratios which creates the
   potential for sex-specific phenotypic matches across the nesting season
   driven by maternal effects. We also describe, for the first time,
   systematic variation in the sex ratio reaction norm curve within a
   single population in a species with TSD.}},

Abstract = {{Hormone-mediated maternal effects generate variation in offspring
   phenotype. In birds, maternal egg testosterone (T) exerts differential
   effects on offspring traits after hatching, suggesting that mothers
   experience a trade-off between contrasting T effects. However, there is
   very little information on T pre-natal effects. In the yellow-legged
   gull (Larus michahellis), we increased yolk T concentration within
   physiological limits and measured the effects on development and
   oxidative status of late-stage embryos. T-treated embryos had a larger
   body size but a smaller brain than controls. Males had a larger brain
   than females, controlling for overall size. T treatment differentially
   affected brain mass and total amount of pro-oxidants in the brain
   depending on laying order. T-treatment effects were not sex dependent.
   For the first time in the wild, we show contrasting T prenatal effects
   on body mass and brain size. Hence, T may enforce trade-offs between
   different embryonic traits, but also within the same trait during
   different developmental periods.}},

Abstract = {{In fishes, maternal exposure to a stressor can influence offspring size
   and behavior. However, less is known about how maternal stress
   influences physiological processes in offspring, such as function of the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis. We examined the impact of
   chronic maternal exposure to an acute chase stressor on the stress
   response/HPI activity of progeny in wild sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus
   nerka). Resting plasma cortisol and brain preoptic area (POA)
   corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) mRNA levels did not vary between
   offspring reared from undisturbed, control females and offspring reared
   from females exposed to the stressor. However, resting levels of POA
   glucocorticoid receptors (GR1 and GR2), and head kidney melanocortin 2
   receptor (MC2R), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), and
   cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) were elevated in
   offspring reared from stressor-exposed females. Offspring reared from
   stressor-exposed females had lower plasma cortisol levels 1-h after an
   acute chase stressor compared to cortisol levels in offspring reared
   from control females. In offspring reared from chased females, mRNA
   levels of genes associated with cortisol biosynthesis were reduced in
   the head kidney post-chase. In offspring reared from control females,
   mRNA levels in the head kidney did not vary pre- to post-chase.
   Together, the results of the present study suggest maternal programming
   of progeny with respect to baseline and stressor-induced mediators of
   HPI axis activity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wild and captive vertebrates face multiple stressors that all have the
   potential to induce chronic maternal stress (i.e., sustained, elevated
   plasma glucocorticoids), resulting in embryo exposure to elevated
   maternally derived glucocorticoids. In oviparous taxa such as fish,
   maternally derived glucocorticoids in eggs are known for their capacity
   to shape offspring phenotype. Using a variety of methodologies,
   scientists have quantified maternally derived levels of egg cortisol,
   the primary glucocorticoid in fishes, and examined the cascading effects
   of egg cortisol on progeny phenotype. Here we summarize and interpret
   the current state of knowledge on egg cortisol in fishes and the
   relationships linking maternal stress/state to egg cortisol and
   offspring phenotype/fitness. Considerable variation in levels of egg
   cortisol exists across species and among females within a species; this
   variation is hypothesized to be due to interspecific differences in
   reproductive life history and intraspecific differences in female
   condition. Outcomes of experimental studies manipulating egg cortisol
   vary both inter-and intraspecifically. Moreover, while exogenous
   elevation of egg cortisol (as a proxy for maternal stress) induces
   phenotypic changes commonly considered to be maladaptive (e.g., smaller
   offspring size), emerging work in other taxa suggests that there can be
   positive effects on fitness when the offspring's environment is taken
   into account. Investigations into (i) mechanisms by which egg cortisol
   elicits phenotypic change in offspring (e.g., epigenetics), (ii)
   maternal and offspring buffering capacity of cortisol, and (iii) factors
   driving natural variation in egg cortisol and how this variation affects
   offspring phenotype and fitness are all germane to discussions on egg
   glucocorticoids as signals of maternal stress.}},

Abstract = {{Conditions experienced by individuals during prenatal development can
   have long-term effects on their phenotype. Maternally transmitted
   resources are important mediators of such prenatal effects, but the
   potential interactive effects among them in shaping offspring phenotype
   have never been studied. Maternally derived testosterone is known to
   stimulate growth, but these benefits may be counterbalanced by an
   increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Maternally
   transmitted carotenoids might have the capacity to scavenge ROS and
   thereby buffer an increase in oxidative stress caused by prenatal
   exposure to high testosterone levels. Here, we experimentally tested for
   such interactive effects between maternal yolk testosterone and
   carotenoid in Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica). We found that hatching
   mass was reduced and reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs) levels at the
   end of the period of maximal growth increased in chicks from eggs
   injected with either testosterone or carotenoid (only a tendency in
   chicks from testosterone-injected eggs). However, when both egg
   compounds were manipulated simultaneously, hatching mass and ROM levels
   were not affected, showing that both carotenoid and testosterone lose
   their detrimental effects when the ratio between the 2 compounds is
   balanced. Our study provides the first experimental evidence for
   interactive effects of 2 maternally derived egg compounds on offspring
   phenotype and suggests that developmental cues are tightly coadjusted
   within an egg.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies on birds have shown that offspring begging and parental
   provisioning covary at the phenotypic level, which is thought to reflect
   genetic correlations. However, prenatal maternal factors, like yolk
   testosterone, may also facilitate parent-offspring coadaptation via
   their effects on offspring begging and development. In fact, maternal
   effects are thought to adjust offspring phenotype to the environmental
   conditions they will experience after birth, which are in turn strongly
   dependent on the levels of parental provisioning. Using cross-fostering
   experiments in canaries, we tested the role of maternal effects on
   parent-offspring coadaptation from two different approaches. First, we
   analyzed whether females deposit yolk testosterone in relation to their
   own or their partner's prospective parental provisioning, measured as
   the rate of parental feeding to foster nestlings. Second, we
   investigated whether females deposit yolk testosterone in relation to
   costs they incurred when raising a previous brood, as this likely
   impinges on their capacity to provide parental care in the near future.
   However, from the results of both experiments we have no evidence that
   canary females deposit yolk testosterone in order to match offspring
   begging to the levels of care they and/or their partners provide. We
   therefore found no evidence that yolk testosterone facilitates
   parent-offspring coadaptation. In addition, our results suggest that the
   functional consequences of yolk testosterone deposition may relate to
   hatching asynchrony since it primarily varied with egg laying order. (C)

Abstract = {{Avian embryos are exposed to yolk androgens that are incorporated into
   the egg by the ovulating female. These steroids can affect several
   aspects of embryo development, often resulting in increases in overall
   size or the speed of growth of different traits. However, several
   studies suggest that they also entail immune costs to the offspring. In
   this study, we explored whether variation in yolk androgen concentration
   affected several measures of the constitutive and cell-mediated immune
   axes in the spotless starling (Sturnus unicolor). Using a within-brood
   design, we injected different doses of androgens (testosterone and
   androstenedione) into the eggs. Our study showed that experimentally
   increased yolk androgens led to sex-specific immunosuppression in both
   the innate and adaptive axes of the immune system. Both cell-mediated
   immune response (CMI) and lysozyme activity decreased with increasing
   androgen levels injected into the egg in the case of male nestlings,
   whereas there were no effects on females. The effects that we found were
   always linear: no quadratic or threshold patterns were detected. We
   found no effects of the experimental treatment in hemolysis or
   agglutination capacity, but these measures were negatively correlated
   with CMI, suggesting negative correlation among different branches of
   the immune system. Blood (trypanosomes and hemosporidians) and
   intestinal (coccidia) parasites were not affected by the experimental
   increase of yolk androgen levels. Our results show that in our study
   species yolk androgens induce immunosuppression in some axes of the male
   nestling immune system. Further studies should analyze the proximate
   causes for these contrasting effects in different axes of the immune
   system and the reason for the differential impact on males and females.}},

Abstract = {{In the coevolutionary dynamic of avian brood parasites and their hosts,
   maternal (or transgenerational) effects have rarely been investigated.
   We examined the potential role of elevated yolk testosterone in eggs of
   the principal brood parasite in North America, the brown-headed cowbird,
   and three of its frequent host species. Elevated maternal androgens in
   eggs are a common maternal effect observed in many avian species when
   breeding conditions are unfavorable. These steroids accelerate embryo
   development, shorten incubation period, increase nestling growth rate,
   and enhance begging vigor, all traits that can increase the survival of
   offspring. We hypothesized that elevated maternal androgens in host eggs
   are a defense against brood parasitism. Our second hypothesis was that
   elevated maternal androgens in cowbird eggs are a defense against
   intra-specific competition. For host species, we found that elevated
   yolk testosterone was correlated with parasitized nests of small
   species, those whose nest success is most reduced by cowbird parasitism.
   For cowbirds, we found that elevated yolk testosterone was correlated
   with eggs in multiply-parasitized nests, which indicate intra-specific
   competition for nests due to high cowbird density. We propose
   experimental work to further examine the use of maternal effects by
   cowbirds and their hosts. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Thyroid hormones (THs) - triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) - are
   essential for embryonic development in vertebrates. All vertebrate
   embryos are exposed to THs from maternal origin. As maternal TH levels
   are known to be essential to embryonic development, the natural
   variation of maternal THs probably represents a pathway of maternal
   effects that can modify offspring phenotype. However, potential fitness
   consequences of variation of maternal TH exposure within the normal
   physiological range and without confounding effects of the mother have
   never been experimentally investigated. We experimentally manipulated
   the levels of yolk T3 and T4 within the physiological range in a species
   in which the embryo develops outside the mother's body, the Rock Pigeon
   (Columba livia) eggs. Making use of the natural difference of yolk
   testosterone between the two eggs of pigeon clutches, we were also able
   to investigate the potential interaction between THs and testosterone.
   Elevated yolk TH levels enhanced embryonic development and hatching
   success, and reduced body mass but not tarsus length between day 14 and
   fledging. The yolk hormones increased plasma T4 concentrations in
   females but reduced it in males, in line with the effect on metabolic
   rate at hatching. Plasma concentrations of T3 and testosterone were not
   significantly affected. The effects of treatment did not differ between
   eggs with high or low testosterone levels. Our data indicate that
   natural variation in maternal yolk TH levels affects offspring phenotype
   and embryonic survival, potentially influencing maternal and chick
   fitness. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Prenatal exposure to elevated glucocorticoids can act as a signal of
   environmental stress, resulting in modifications to offspring phenotype.
   While ``negative{''} phenotypic effects (i.e., smaller size, slower
   growth) are often reported, recent research coupling phenotype with
   other fitnessrelated traits has suggested positive impacts of prenatal
   stress. Using captive Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), we
   treated eggs with biologically relevant cortisol levels-low (300 ng
   mL(-1)), high (1,000 ng mL(-1)), or control (0 ng mL(-1))-to examine the
   early-life impacts of maternally transferred stress hormones on
   offspring. Specifically, we measured early survival, rate of
   development, and multiple measures of morphology. Low and high cortisol
   dosing of eggs resulted in significantly higher survival compared to
   controls (37\% and 24\% higher, respectively). Fish reared from high
   dose eggs were structurally smaller compared to control fish, but
   despite this variation in structural size, exposure to elevated cortisol
   did not impact developmental rate. These results demonstrate that
   elevations in egg cortisol can positively influence offspring fitness
   through an increase in early survival while also altering phenotype at a
   critical life-history stage. Overall, these results suggest that
   exposure to prenatal stress may not always produce apparently negative
   impacts on offspring fitness and further proposes that complex
   phenotypic responses should be examined in relevant environmental
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Early exposure to steroid hormones, as in the case of an avian embryo
   exposed yolk testosterone, can impact the biology of an individual in
   different ways over the course of its life. While many early-life
   effects of yolk testosterone have been documented, later-life effects
   remain poorly studied. We followed a cohort of twenty captive pigeons
   hatched in 2005. Half of these birds came from eggs with experimentally
   increased concentrations of testosterone; half came from control eggs.
   Preliminary results suggest non-random mortality during the birds' first
   nine years of life. Hitherto, all males have survived, and control
   females have survived better than testosterone-treated ones. Despite
   inherent challenges, studies of later-life consequences of early-life
   exposure in longer-lived species can offer new perspectives that are
   precluded by studies of immediate outcomes or shorter-lived species.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding reproductive performance in ecologically impoverished vs.
   more sustained anthropogenic habitats is critical to assess population
   health status and to develop land use and conservation management
   strategies. We compared resource-based maternal effects, reproductive
   performance, and offspring quality in a model migratory passerine bird,
   the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris). We assessed female condition,
   quantity of egg constituents, quality of diet consumed during egg
   formation, and nestling growth and survival in two habitats: cultivated
   farmland and meadows. Egg, albumin, and shell mass were greater at the
   meadow site, while yolk mass did not differ significantly between sites;
   albumin mass most strongly predicted egg mass. Stable isotope enrichment
   (delta N-15 and delta C-13) in yolk but not albumin suggests a broader
   range of diet for yolk formation at the meadow site but could also
   reflect different hydric conditions between sites. delta C-13 and delta
   N-15 enrichment did not predict yolk, albumin, or egg mass.
   Concentration of yolk testosterone was higher at the meadow site and
   correlated with delta C-13 enrichment in yolk. Nestling survival was
   higher in the meadow than in the farmland site and corresponded to egg
   mass and delta C-13 enrichment in lipid-free yolk. Surviving nestlings
   were larger in the meadow than in the farmland site. Results indicate
   that agricultural practice influences reproductive output through
   resource-based maternal effects. The analyses of isotopic and
   biochemical composition of small samples of yolk and albumin may provide
   a minimally invasive tool to assess individual reproductive performance
   and predict impacts of habitat quality on population health.}},

Abstract = {{In many bird species that practice parental care, siblings often compete
   for resources and care provided by their parents, although their
   strategies differ according to hatching rank and condition. Differences
   in offspring strategies are generally attributed to hatching order and
   maternal effects, which are difficult to separate because these effects
   are often correlated. For example, third-hatched chicks of large gull
   species receive more egg testosterones and corticosterone, which
   influence early behavioral patterns. In this study, we carried out a
   cross-fostering experiment with first-and last-laid eggs of the
   yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) to test whether the within-brood
   variation in behavioral strategies for competing with siblings and
   coping with stress are due to maternal effects or to hatching order.
   Chicks hatched in the last position within the experimental brood
   emitted more chatter calls to attract parents' attention, were less
   prone to respond to warning of danger, and had a lower breathing rate
   while restrained than first-hatched chicks. Egg laying order did not
   affect chick behaviors or breathing rate. Thus, we concluded that the
   different behavioral strategies of chicks were determined by their
   posthatching experience and not by the original egg position within the
   clutch. Last-laid eggs were smaller and chicks from those eggs grew
   slower than chicks from first-laid eggs. Independently of the original
   laying order, chicks that hatched first in the experimental brood grew
   faster than their siblings. Overall, our results indicate that
   behavioral strategies of chicks are plastic and influenced by their
   early social experience.}},

Abstract = {{The early developmental trajectory is affected by genetic and
   environmental factors that co-depend and interact often in a complex
   way. In order to distinguish their respective roles, we used canaries
   (Serinus canaria) of different genetic backgrounds (inbred and outbred
   birds). An artificial size hierarchy was created to provoke within-nest
   competition, manipulating postnatal conditions. To this end, inbred
   birds were weight-matched with outbred birds into duos, and each nest
   contained one duo of size-advantaged, and one duo of size-disadvantaged
   inbred and outbred nestlings. Prenatal (maternal) effects were taken
   into account also, enabling us to study the separate as well as the
   interactive effects of inbreeding, pre- and postnatal conditions on
   nestling development. We find that postnatal conditions were the most
   important determinant of early growth, with size-advantaged nestlings
   growing faster and obtaining larger size/body mass at fledging in
   comparison with size-disadvantaged nestlings. Prenatal conditions were
   important too, with birds that hatched from eggs that were laid late in
   the laying order obtaining a larger size at fledging than those hatched
   from early laid eggs. Inbreeding inhibited growth, but surprisingly this
   did not depend on (dis)advantageous pre- or postnatal conditions. Our
   findings imply that inbred individuals lose when they are in direct
   competition with same-sized outbred individuals regardless of the
   rearing conditions, and we thus propose that reduced competitiveness is
   one of the driving forces of inbreeding depression.}},

   effect: a meta-analysis of yolk testosterone response to competition}},
Journal = {{ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Competition between conspecifics during the breeding season can result
   in behavioural and physiological programming of offspring via maternal
   effects. For birds, in which maternal effects are best studied, it has
   been claimed that exposure to increased competition causes greater
   deposition of testosterone into egg yolks, which creates faster growing,
   more aggressive offspring; such traits are thought to be beneficial for
   high-competition environments. Nevertheless, not all species show a
   positive relationship between competitive interactions and yolk
   testosterone, and an explanation for this interspecific variation is
   lacking. We here test if the magnitude and direction of maternal
   testosterone allocated to eggs in response to competition can be
   explained by life-history traits while accounting for phylogenetic
   relationships. We performed a meta-analysis relating effect size of yolk
   testosterone response to competition with species coloniality, nest
   type, parental effort and mating type. We found that effect size was
   moderated by coloniality and nest type; colonial species and those with
   open nests allocate less testosterone to eggs when in more competitive
   environments. Applying a life-history perspective helps contextualize
   studies showing little or negative responses of yolk testosterone to
   competition and improves our understanding of how variation in this
   maternal effect may have evolved.}},

Abstract = {{Maternally-derived hormones in oocytes, such as glucocorticoids (GCs),
   play a crucial role in embryo development in oviparous taxa. In fishes,
   maternal stressor exposure increases circulating and egg cortisol
   levels, the primary GC in fishes, as well as induces oxidative stress.
   Elevated egg cortisol levels modify offspring traits but whether
   maternal oxidative stress correlates with circulating and egg cortisol
   levels, and whether maternal/egg cortisol levels correlate with
   offspring oxidative stress have yet to be determined. The objective of
   this study was to examine the relationships among maternal and egg
   cortisol, and maternal and offspring oxidative stress to provide insight
   into the potential intergenerational effects of stressor exposure in
   sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Antioxidant concentration and
   oxidative stress were measured in maternal tissues (plasma, brain, heart
   and liver) as well as offspring developmental stages (pre-fertilization,
   24 h post-fertilization, eyed, and hatch), and were compared to both
   naturally-occurring and experimentally-elevated (via cortisol egg bath)
   levels of cortisol in eggs. Oxygen radical absorptive capacity of
   tissues from maternal sockeye salmon was measured spectrophotometrically
   and was not correlated with maternal or egg cortisol concentrations.
   Also, naturally-occurring and experimentally-elevated cortisol levels in
   eggs (to mimic maternal stress) did not affect oxidative stress or
   antioxidant capacity of the offspring. We conclude that the metrics of
   maternal stress examined in sockeye salmon (i.e., maternal/egg cortisol,
   maternal oxidative stress) are independent of each other, and that egg
   cortisol content does not influence offspring oxidative stress. (C) 2016

   experimentally-elevated concentrations of cortisol in newly fertilized
   eggs had effects on offspring morphology and/or burst swimming capacity.
   Immediately following fertilization, eggs were incubated for 2 h with
   water dosed with 0 ng/mL or 1000 ng/mL of cortisol. Embryos were reared
   to the fry life stage (complete yolk sac absorption). Morphology and
   burst swimming performance of fry were then assessed. Sockeye salmon fry
   reared from cortisol-treated eggs were smaller overall (i.e., smaller
   body, fins and eyes) compared to conspecifics reared from untreated
   eggs. In contrast, the morphology of chum salmon fry was not affected by
   the experimental elevation of egg cortisol. In both species, burst
   swimming duration was unaffected by egg cortisol treatment, while
   offspring reared from the cortisol-treated eggs initiated fewer bouts of
   burst swimming. Our results demonstrate that closely-related species can
   respond differently to elevations in egg cortisol, and not all offspring
   traits may be affected by these elevations in cortisol. Further efforts
   to establish links among offspring quality, maternal stress, and egg
   composition need to consider the potential for divergent responses among
   species and examine multiple measures of phenotype and performance
   throughout development.}},

Abstract = {{Sex-linkage is predicted to evolve in response to sex-specific or
   sexually antagonistic selection. In line with this prediction, most
   sex-linked genes are associated with reproduction in the respective sex.
   In addition to traits directly involved in fertility and fecundity,
   mediators of maternal effects may be predisposed to evolve sex-linkage,
   because they indirectly affect female fitness through their effect on
   offspring phenotype. Here, we test for sex-linked inheritance of a key
   mediator of prenatal maternal effects in oviparous species, the transfer
   of maternally derived testosterone to the eggs. Consistent with maternal
   inheritance, we found that in Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica)
   granddaughters resemble their maternal (but not their paternal)
   grandmother in yolk testosterone deposition. This pattern of resemblance
   was not due to non-genetic priming effects of testosterone exposure
   during prenatal development, as an experimental manipulation of yolk
   testosterone levels did not affect the females' testosterone transfer to
   their own eggs later in life. Instead, W chromosome and/or mitochondrial
   variation may underlie the observed matrilineal inheritance pattern.
   Ultimately, the inheritance of mediators of maternal effects along the
   maternal line will allow for a fast and direct response to
   female-specific selection, thereby affecting the dynamics of
   evolutionary processes mediated by maternal effects.}},

Abstract = {{Global warming has substantially changed the environment, but the
   mechanisms to cope with these changes in animals, including the role of
   maternal effects, are poorly understood. Maternal effects via hormones
   deposited in eggs, have important environment-dependent effects on
   offspring development and fitness: thus females are expected to adjust
   these hormones to the environment, such as the ambient temperature.
   Longer-term temperature variation could function as a cue, predicting
   chick rearing conditions to which yolk hormone levels are adjusted,
   while short-term temperature variation during egg formation may causally
   affect hormone transfer to eggs. We studied the effects of ambient
   temperature on yolk androgens (testosterone and androstenedione) and
   thyroid hormones (thyroxine and triiodothyronine) in great tits (Parus
   major) using data from unmanipulated clutches from a wild population and
   from aviary birds (ad libitum food) exposed to different experimental
   temperature treatments during five years. Both in the wild and in
   captivity, longer-term pre-laying ambient temperature was not associated
   with clutch mean yolk hormone levels, while the way androstenedione and
   thyroxine levels varied across the laying sequence did associate with
   pre-laying temperature in the wild. Yolk testosterone levels were
   positively correlated with short-term temperature (during yolk
   formation) changes within clutches in both wild and captivity. We also
   report, for the first time in a wild bird, that yolk thyroxine levels
   correlated with a key environmental factor: thyroxine levels were
   negatively correlated with ambient temperature during egg formation.
   Thus, yolk hormone levels, especially testosterone, seem to be causally
   affected by ambient temperature. These short-term effects might reflect
   physiological changes in females with changes in ambient temperature.
   The adaptive value of the variation with ambient temperatures pre-laying
   or during egg formation should be studied with hormone manipulations in
   different thermal environments. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal reproductive investment can critically influence offspring
   phenotype, and thus these maternal effects are expected to be under
   strong natural selection. Knowledge on the extent of heritable variation
   in the physiological mechanisms underlying maternal effects is however
   limited. In birds, resource allocation to eggs is a key mechanism for
   mothers to affect their offspring and different components of the egg
   may or may not be independently adjusted. We studied the heritability of
   egg components and their genetic and phenotypic covariation in great
   tits (Parus major), using captive-bred full siblings of wild origin. Egg
   mass, testosterone (T) and androstenedione (A4) hormone concentrations
   showed moderate heritability, in agreement with earlier findings.
   Interestingly, yolk triiodothyronine hormone (T3), but not its
   precursor, thyroxine hormone (T4), concentration was heritable. An
   immune factor, albumen lysozyme, showed moderate heritability, but yolk
   immunoglobulins (IgY) did not. The genetic correlation estimates were
   moderate but statistically nonsignificant; a trend for a positive
   genetic correlation was found between A4 and egg mass, T and lysozyme
   and IgY and lysozyme, respectively. Interestingly, phenotypic
   correlations were found only between A4 and T, and T4 and T3,
   respectively. Given that these egg components are associated with
   fitness-related traits in the offspring (and mother), and that we show
   that some components are heritable, it opens the possibility that
   natural selection may shape the rate and direction of phenotypic change
   via egg composition.}},

Abstract = {{Maternally-derived glucocorticoids can modify the normal development of
   young animals. To date, little is known about maternal effects that are
   mediated by acute embryonic exposure to glucocorticoids. In birds,
   elevated maternal transmission of corticosterone (CORT) to egg albumen
   is mainly dependent on acute stress. In this study, we increased CORT
   levels in the egg albumen of a wild passerine, the great tit (Parus
   major), breeding in favourable deciduous and less suitable coniferous
   habitat. Subsequently we measured the somatic growth, baseline and acute
   glucocorticoid responses, immunity and behaviour of prenatally
   manipulated offspring with respect to control siblings. We found that
   prenatally CORT-exposed nestlings had lower baseline CORT levels, a more
   rapid decline in CORT during recovery from a standardized stressor, and
   a reduced heterophil/lymphocyte ratio compared with controls. Although
   stress -induced total CORT levels remained unchanged, free CORT levels
   were significantly lower and the levels of corticosteroid binding
   globulins (CBG) significantly higher in experimental offspring.
   Prenatally CORT-exposed offspring begged longer after hatching than
   controls. Stress induced behavioural activity of fledglings did not
   differ between treatments, while its association with baseline CORT
   levels was significant in the control group only. The body mass and
   tarsus length of fledglings was positively affected by manipulation in
   unfavourable coniferous habitat only. We conclude that maternal effects
   related to elevated levels of albumen CORT modify diverse aspects of
   offspring phenotype and potentially increase offspring performance in
   resource poor environments. Moreover, our results indicate that maternal
   glucocorticoids may suppress the effect of hormones on behavioural
   responses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The environment experienced by parents can impact the phenotype of their
   offspring (parental effects), a critical component of organismal ecology
   and evolution in variable or changing environments. Although temperature
   is acentral feature of the environment forectotherms, its role in
   parental effects has been little explored until recently. Here, parental
   basking opportunity was manipulated in an oviparous lizard with
   temperature-dependent sex determination, the jacky dragon (Amphibolurus
   muricatus). Eggs were incubated at a temperature that typically produces
   a 50: 50 sex ratio, and hatchlings were reared in a standard thermal
   environment. Offspring of parents in short bask conditions appeared to
   have better fitness outcomes in captive conditions than those of parents
   in long bask conditions -they had greater growth and survival as a
   function of their mass. In addition, the sex of offspring (male or
   female) depended on the interaction between parental treatment and egg
   mass, and treatment impacted whether sons or daughters grew larger in
   their first season. The interactive effects of treatment on offspring
   sex and growth are consistent with adaptive explanations for the
   existence of temperature-dependent sex determination in this species.
   Moreover, the greater performance recorded in short bask offspring may
   represent an anticipatory parental effect to aid offspring in predicted
   conditions of restricted thermal opportunity. Together, these responses
   constitute a crucial component of the population response to spatial or
   temporal variation in temperature.}},

Abstract = {{In many animal species, mothers expose their embryos to maternal
   hormones. This provides a powerful pathway for affecting offspring
   phenotype and a potential mechanism for adaptive nongenomic inheritance.
   This has been studied extensively in birds because the embryo develops
   outside the mother's body, facilitating experimental studies. Some
   studies have demonstrated that maternal yolk testosterone (T) can have
   long-lasting effects into the period after fledging. However, these
   results are based on offspring in the juvenile stage or their first
   breeding season only. The lack of data further into adulthood limits a
   better assessment of the fitness consequences of prenatal T. In a series
   of previous experiments in the rock pigeon, Columba livia, we
   manipulated yolk T levels using oil-injected eggs as controls. In the
   present study, we examined the reproductive behaviour of birds from
   these eggs when they were 1-3 years old and housed together in a large
   aviary. Our results showed that males from T-injected eggs were less
   aggressive and females from T-injected eggs laid lighter eggs than
   controls. Moreover, the experimental birds showed strongly
   disassortative mating with respect to hormone treatment. There were no
   indications of treatment effects on the process of sexual
   differentiation. Our results indicate that the effects of prenatal T do
   not diminish over age and may last far into adulthood, which should be
   taken into account in assessing the fitness consequences of maternal
   hormones. They may also stimulate new physiological and neurobiological
   studies on the mechanisms underlying such long-lasting effects of
   prenatal T exposure. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal

Title = {{Relationship between maternal environment and DNA methylation patterns

   nestlings: a pilot study}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{There is mounting evidence that, across taxa, females breeding in
   competitive environments tend to allocate more testosterone to their
   offspring prenatally and these offspring typically have more aggressive
   and faster-growing phenotypes. To date, no study has determined the
   mechanisms mediating this maternal effect's influence on offspring
   phenotype. However, levels of estrogen receptor alpha (ER) gene
   expression are linked to differences in early growth and aggression;
   thus, maternal hormones may alter gene regulation, perhaps via DNA
   methylation, of ER in offspring during prenatal development. We
   performed a pilot study to examine natural variation in testosterone
   allocation to offspring through egg yolks in wild Eastern Bluebirds
   (Sialia sialis) in varying breeding densities and percent DNA
   methylation of CG dinucleotides in the ER promoter in offspring brain
   regions associated with growth and behavior. We hypothesized that
   breeding density would be positively correlated with yolk testosterone,
   and prenatal exposure to maternal-derived yolk testosterone would be
   associated with greater offspring growth and decreased ER promoter
   methylation. Yolk testosterone concentration was positively correlated
   with breeding density, nestling growth rate, and percent DNA methylation
   of one out of five investigated CpG sites (site 3) in the diencephalon
   ER promoter, but none in the telencephalon (n=10). Percent DNA
   methylation of diencephalon CpG site 3 was positively correlated with
   growth rate. These data suggest a possible role for epigenetics in
   mediating the effects of the maternal environment on offspring
   phenotype. Experimentally examining this mechanism with a larger sample
   size in future studies may help elucidate a prominent way in which
   animals respond to their environment. Further, by determining the
   mechanisms that mediate maternal effects, we can begin to understand the
   potential for the heritability of these mechanisms and the impact that
   maternal effects are capable of producing at an evolutionary scale.}},

Abstract = {{Glucocorticoids circulating in breeding birds during egg production
   accumulate within eggs, and may provide a potent form of maternal effect
   on offspring phenotype. However, whether these steroids affect offspring
   development remains unclear. Here, we employed a non-invasive technique
   that experimentally elevated the maternal transfer of corticosterone to
   eggs in a wild population of house wrens. Feeding
   corticosterone-injected mealworms to free-living females prior to and
   during egg production increased the number of eggs that females produced
   and increased corticosterone concentrations in egg yolks. This treatment
   also resulted in an increase in the amount of yolk allocated to eggs.
   Offspring hatching from these eggs begged for food at a higher rate than
   control offspring and eventually attained increased prefledging body
   condition, a trait predictive of their probability of recruitment as
   breeding adults in the study population. Our results indicate that an
   increase in maternal glucocorticoids within the physiological range can
   enhance maternal investment and offspring development. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Glucocorticoid hormones play a key role in day-to-day adjustments to
   fluctuating metabolic needs. These hormones also mediate physiological
   and behavioral responses to stressful events, allowing individuals to
   cope with stressors. Various environmental insults, such as a food
   shortages, predation attempts, and agonistic encounters often elevate
   plasma glucocorticoid levels in vertebrates. Because exposure to
   maternally-derived (via circulation or egg) glucocorticoids may be
   detrimental to the developing embryo, maternal stress can have negative
   carryover effects on offspring fitness. We examined corticosterone, the
   primary avian glucocorticoid, concentrations in egg yolk in a
   plural-breeding, joint-nesting species, the smooth-billed ani
   (Crotophaga ani), in which females compete among themselves to lay eggs
   in the final incubated clutch. We investigated whether yolk
   corticosterone levels varied with laying order and group size. Because
   egg-laying competition leads to physiological and social stress that is
   intensified with group size and laying order, we predicted that yolk
   corticosterone levels should increase from the early to the late
   egg-laying period and from single female to multi-female groups. In this
   two-year field study, we found that yolk corticosterone levels of
   late-laid eggs within the communal clutch were higher in multi-female
   groups than in single female groups. Results from this study suggest
   that laying females experience higher levels of stress in multi-female
   groups and that this maternal stress influences yolk corticosterone
   concentrations. This study identifies a novel cost of group-living in
   plural-breeding cooperatively breeding birds, namely an increase in yolk
   corticosterone levels with group size that may result in detrimental
   effects on offspring development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Maternal effects occur when the mother's phenotype influences her
   offspring's phenotype. In birds, differential allocation in egg yolk
   components can allow mothers to compensate for the competitive
   disadvantage of junior chicks. We hypothesize that the parent-older
   chick conflict peaks at intermediate conditions: parents benefit from
   the younger chick(s) survival, but its death benefits the older chick in
   terms of growth and survival. We thus expect maternal compensation to
   follow a bell-shaped pattern in relation to environmental conditions. We
   studied a black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) population where
   previous results revealed increased allocation of yolk testosterone in
   younger as compared to older chicks in intermediate conditions, in line
   with our theoretical framework. We therefore predicted a maternally
   induced increase in aggressiveness, growth, and survival for younger
   chicks born in intermediate environmental conditions. Controlling for
   parental effects and chick sex, we manipulated food availability before
   egg laying to create a situation with intermediate (Unfed group) and
   good (Fed group) environmental conditions. Within each feeding
   treatment, we further created experimental broods where the natural
   hatching order was reversed to maximize our chances to observe an effect
   of feeding treatment on the younger chicks' aggressiveness. As
   predicted, we found that chick aggressiveness was higher in younger
   chicks born from the Unfed group (i.e., in intermediate environmental
   conditions), but only when they were put in a senior position, in
   reversed broods. Predictions on growth and survival were not confirmed.
   Mothers thus seem to favor the competitiveness of their younger chick in
   intermediate conditions via egg yolk components, but our study also
   suggests that hatching asynchrony need to be small for maternal
   compensation to be efficient. We emphasize the need for further studies
   investigating other chick behaviors (e.g., begging) and focusing on the
   relative role of different yolk components in shaping parent-offspring
   conflict over sibling competition.}},

Title = {{Effects of experimentally manipulated yolk thyroid hormone levels on
   offspring development in a wild bird species}},
Journal = {{HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{38-44}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Maternal effects are a crucial mechanism in a wide array of taxa to
   generate phenotypic variation, thereby affecting offspring development
   and fitness. Maternally derived thyroid hormones (THs) are known to be
   essential for offspring development in mammalian and fish models, but
   have been largely neglected in avian studies, especially in respect to
   natural variation and an ecological context. We studied, for the first
   time in a wild species and population, the effects of maternally derived
   THs on offspring development, behavior, physiology and fitness-related
   traits by experimental elevation of thyroxine and triiodothyronine in
   ovo within the physiological range in great tits (Parus major). We found
   that elevated yolk TH levels had a sex-specific effect on growth,
   increasing male and decreasing female growth, relative to controls, and
   this effect was similar throughout the nestling period. Hatching or
   fledging success, motor coordination behavior, stress reactivity and
   resting metabolic rate were not affected by the TH treatment. We
   conclude that natural variation in maternally derived THs may affect
   some offspring traits in a wild species. As this is the first study on
   yolk thyroid hormones in a wild species and population, more such
   studies are needed to investigate its effects on pre-hatching
   development, and juvenile and adult fitness before generalizations on
   the importance of maternally derived yolk thyroid hormones can be made.
   However, this opens a new, interesting avenue for further research in
   the field of hormone mediated maternal effects. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Understanding how sexual conflict influences male and female parental
   decisions is a long-standing problem in behavioral ecology. Until now,
   most research on sexual conflict over parental care has focused on
   behavioral mechanisms mediating the resolution of this conflict through
   negotiation between parents. Here, we review evidence suggesting that
   maternal effects that alter offspring phenotypes may provide females
   with a mechanism for manipulating male care. We show that empirical
   studies on the role of maternal androgens in birds with biparental care
   provide no support for female manipulation of male care. However, we
   argue that it would be premature to conclude that maternal androgens
   play no role in female manipulation of male care given methodological
   problems in previous work. We then identify a number of additional
   mechanisms by which females may manipulate male care, including egg
   components other than androgens, egg size, and egg coloration. We show
   that there is good evidence that egg coloration affects male care,
   suggesting that this mechanism warrants further research. We also
   highlight that current evidence is derived from studies using
   experimental design that target specific candidate mechanisms, such as
   maternal androgens. Given the multitude of candidate mechanisms, we
   discuss an alternative approach based on targeting ecologically relevant
   prenatal conditions, such as food availability, and monitoring
   subsequent effects on candidate mechanisms, offspring phenotypes, and
   male and female care. Finally, we argue that it is timely to extend this
   work beyond birds with biparental care to include other taxa and species
   with uniparental male care and cooperative breeding.}},

Title = {{Yolk testosterone affects growth and promotes individual-level
   consistency in behavioral lateralization of yellow-legged gull chicks}},
Journal = {{HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{80}},
Pages = {{58-67}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Behavioral lateralization is common in animals and may be expressed at
   the individual- and at the population level. The ontogenetic processes
   that control lateralization, however, are largely unknown.
   Well-established sex-dependence in androgen physiology and sex-dependent
   variation in lateralization have led to the hypothesis that testosterone
   (T) has organizational effects on lateralization. The effects of T
   exposure in early life on lateralization can be efficiently investigated
   by manipulating T levels in the cleidoic eggs of birds, because the
   embryo is isolated from maternal and sibling physiological interference,
   but this approach has been adopted very rarely. In the yellow-legged
   gull (Laws michahellis) we increased yolk T concentration within the
   physiological limits and tested the effects on the direction of
   lateralization in two functionally fundamental behaviors (begging for
   parental care and escape to cover) of molecularly sexed hatchlings. We
   also speculated that T may intervene in regulating consistency, rather
   than direction of lateralization, and therefore tested if T affected the
   `repeatability' of lateral preference in consecutive behavioral trials.
   T treatment had no effect on the direction of lateralization, but
   enhanced the consistency of lateral preference in escape responses. Sex
   did not predict lateralization. Neither behavior was lateralized at the
   population-level. We therefore showed for the first time in any species
   an effect of egg T on consistency in lateralization. The implications of
   the effect of T for the evolution of trade-offs in maternal allocation
   of egg hormones, and the evolutionary interpretations of findings from
   our studies on lateralization among unmanipulated birds are discussed.

Title = {{Paternal attractiveness and the effects of differential allocation of
   parental investment}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {{69-78}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The differential allocation hypothesis (DAH) predicts that an individual
   should vary its reproductive investment according to the attractiveness
   of its mate. A recently revised version of the DAH makes explicit that
   investment can be positive, i.e. higher for the offspring of attractive
   males which should be of higher quality, or negative, i.e. higher for
   offspring of unattractive males, for example compensating for inheriting
   poor paternal genes. Moreover, investment can be made by the father and
   the mother. Here, we tested whether experimental manipulation of male
   attractiveness affected parental investment at different reproductive
   stages and thus influenced fitness-related traits in offspring. In two
   aviaries, all male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, were given red
   leg rings to increase attractiveness and in two aviaries all males
   received green leg rings to decrease attractiveness. This controlled for
   assortative mating between treatments. Ring colour was merely an
   experimental manipulation of male attractiveness, not paternal quality,
   so we might expect additional investment to elevate offspring quality.
   Eggs were cross-fostered between and within treatments to allow
   differentiation of effects of investment in eggs and nestlings. Clutch
   and brood sizes were standardized. Both positive and negative investment
   were observed: Eggs from red-ringed fathers had higher yolk to albumen
   ratios than eggs from green-ringed fathers. Nestlings from eggs laid and
   incubated by parents in the red-ringed group had higher hatching masses
   than those in the green-ringed group. Both parents in the green-ringed
   group fed nestlings more frequently than red-ringed parents. Offspring
   performance was influenced by the treatment of both foster and
   biological parents, but combined effects of these different investment
   patterns on fitness-related traits were ambiguous. Male attractiveness
   appeared to affect patterns of reproductive investment but not
   consistently across all forms of reproductive investment suggesting that
   the costs and benefits of differential allocation vary among individuals
   and across contexts. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{In this study, we assessed whether prenatal exposure to elevated yolk
   steroid hormones can influence in ovo chemosensory learning and the

   challenge by experimentally enhancing yolk progesterone, testosterone,
   and estradiol concentrations in hen eggs prior to incubation. The
   embryos from these hormones-treated eggs (HO) as well as sham embryos
   (O) that had received the vehicle-only were exposed to the odor of fish
   oil (menhaden) between embryonic Days 11 and 20. An additional group of
   control embryos (C) was not exposed to the odor. All chicks were tested
   following hatching for their feeding preferences between foods that were
   or were not odorized with the menhaden odor. In the 3-min choice tests,
   the behavior of O chicks differed significantly according to the type of
   food whereas C and HO chicks showed no preference between odorized and
   non-odorized food. Our result suggests weaker response in HO chicks. In
   addition, HO chicks showed impaired growth and reduced intake of an
   unfamiliar food on the 24-h time scale compared to controls. Our data
   suggest that embryonic exposure to increased yolk hormone levels can
   alter growth, chemosensory learning, and the development of feeding

Title = {{Maternal adjustment or constraint: differential effects of food

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In oviparous species like birds, eggs provide the direct environment in
   which embryos are developing. Mothers may adjust different egg
   components in different ways in reaction to environmental cues either to
   adjust offspring development or because of constraints. In this study,
   we investigated the effects of food quality and quantity before and
   during egg laying on three different aspects of egg quality:
   macro-nutrients (egg and yolk mass), androgens (testosterone and
   androstenedione), and thyroid hormones (3,5,3-triiodothyronine, T3 and
   l-thyroxine, T4), using the rock pigeon (Columba livia). As expected,
   egg and yolk mass were significantly reduced for the eggs laid under the
   poor-food condition, indicating a maternal trade-off between offspring
   and self in allocating important resources. We did not find any
   significant change in yolk testosterone or their within-clutch pattern
   over the laying sequence. This is consistent with the fact that, in
   contrast with nutrients, these hormones are not costly to produce, but
   does not support the hypothesis that they play a role in adjusting brood
   size to food conditions. In contrast, we found that T3 levels were
   higher in the egg yolks under the poor-food condition whereas the total
   T4 content was lower. This change could be related to the fact that
   iodine, the critical constituent of thyroid hormones, might be a
   limiting factor in the production of this hormone. Given the knowledge
   that food restriction usually lead to reduction of circulating T3
   levels, our results suggested that avian mothers can independently
   regulate its concentrations in their eggs from their own circulation.
   The study demonstrates that environmentally induced maternal effects via
   the egg can be a result of a combination of constrained resources and
   unconstrained signals and that thyroid hormones might be an interesting
   case of both. Therefore, this hormone and the interplay of different
   maternal effects on the offspring phenotype deserve much more attention.}},

Abstract = {{In birds, mothers can affect their offspring's phenotype and thereby
   survival via egg composition. It is not well known to what extent and
   time-scales environmental variation in resource availability, either via
   resource constrains or adaptive adjustment to predicted rearing
   conditions, influences maternal effects. We experimentally studied
   whether egg and yolk mass and yolk hormone levels respond to short-term
   changes in food availability during laying in wild great tits Parus
   major. Our treatment groups were: 1) food supplementation (mealworms)
   from the 1st until the last egg; 2) food supplementation from the 1st
   until the 5th egg, where the effect of cessation of the supplementary
   food treatment could also be studied; 3) no food supplementation
   (controls). We analysed both nutritional resources (egg, yolk and
   albumen mass), and the important developmental signals, yolk androgens
   (testosterone and androstenedione), and for the first time in a wild
   population, yolk thyroid hormones (thyroxine and
   3,5,3-triiodothyronine). Egg mass is a costly resource for females,
   androgens most likely non-costly signals, whereas thyroid hormones may
   be costly signals, requiring environmental iodine. In the food
   supplemented group egg, yolk and albumen mass increased rapidly relative
   to controls and when food supplementation was halted, egg and albumen
   mass decreased, indicating rapid responses to resource availability.
   Yolk androgen and thyroid hormone levels were not affected by food
   supplementation during laying. Thyroxine showed an increase over the
   laying sequence and its biological meaning needs further study. The
   rapid changes in egg mass to variation in within-clutch food
   availability suggest energetic/protein/nutrient constrains on egg
   formation. The lack of a response in yolk hormones suggest that perhaps
   in this species the short-term changes in resource availability during
   egg laying do not predict offspring rearing conditions, or (for thyroid
   hormones) do not cause systemic changes in circulating hormones, and
   hence do not affect maternal signaling.}},

Abstract = {{Differences in the deposition of limited maternal resources to eggs can
   reflect the optimal allocation to manipulate offspring phenotype, or
   constraints caused by maternal condition. We examined multiple maternal
   substances transferred to eggs in the magpie Pica pica to test the
   hypothesis that certain substances represent constraint and some optimal
   allocation. We did this by supplementary feeding magpies prior to
   egg-laying and then comparing the effect of food on maternal substances
   in conjunction with laying order relative to a control group. Certain
   substances such as carotenoids, immunoglobulins and avidin responded
   positively to food supplementation, whereas others, such as testosterone
   and total protein content of eggs, did not. Immunoglobulin allocation
   increased with laying order in fed but not in unfed groups. Our results
   suggest that patterns of optimal allocation and constraint in
   maternally-provisioned substances co-occur within clutches. Furthermore,
   constraint and optimal allocation may co-occur within the same substance
   i.e. immunoglobulins, highlighting the complexities of maternal resource
   allocation.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal effects are a crucial mechanism in many taxa in generating
   phenotypic variation, affecting offspring development and fitness and
   thereby potentially adapting them to their expected environments.
   Androgen hormones in bird eggs have attracted considerable interest in
   past years, and it is frequently assumed that their concentrations in
   eggs are shaped by Darwinian selection. Currently, however, the data is
   scattered over species with very different life-history strategies,
   environments and selection pressures, making it difficult to draw any
   firm conclusions as to their functional significance for a given system.
   I review the evidence available as to the function, variation and
   potential adaptive value of yolk androgens (testosterone, T and
   androstenedione, A4) using one well-studied wild bird model system, the
   European flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca and Ficedula albicollis. These
   species both show genetic and environmental variation in yolk androgen
   levels, along with fitness correlations for the female, suggesting the
   potential for selection. However, variation in yolk T and A4 seem to be
   differentially affected, suggesting that maternal constraints/costs
   shape the transfer of the yolk steroids differently. Most of the
   environmental variation is consistent with the idea of high yolk
   androgen levels under poor rearing conditions, although the effect sizes
   in relation to environmental variation are rather small in relation to
   genetic among-female variation. Importantly, within-clutch patterns too
   vary in relation to environmental conditions. Yolk androgens seem to
   have multiple short- and long-term effects on phenotype and behavior;
   importantly, they are also correlated with the fitness of offspring and
   mothers. However, the effects are often sex-dependent, and not
   universally beneficial for the offspring. Unfortunately, conclusive data
   as to the adaptive benefits of clutch mean androgen levels or within
   clutch-patterns in different environmental conditions is still lacking.

Title = {{Maternal effects, malaria infections and the badge size of the house
   sparrow}},
Journal = {{AVIAN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: The evolution of sexual signals is not only determined by
   immediate sexual selection but also by selection arising from the
   environment and the interaction with developmental effects. In this
   study we aimed to investigate how the badge size of male house sparrows
   (Passer domesticus) is correlated to avian malaria infections as well as
   to prenatal testosterone exposure, measured as the 2D:4D digit ratio.
   The rationale behind this study is that the immunosuppressive effect of
   maternal testosterone deposition combined with the fitness cost imposed
   by parasites may cause important trade-offs to the development of
   secondary sexual signals.
   Methods: Assuming that vector abundance is a key variable associated
   with infection risk by avian malaria, we caught adult male sparrows from
   eight different populations in the Camargue, France, four of which were
   located in a vector-controlled area, and the other four in an untreated
   area. For each bird we measured its badge size, digit ratio and took
   blood to determine its infections status. We used PCR to identify the
   malaria parasite species and strain that caused the infection.
   Results: Contrary to our expectation, prevalence of disease did not
   differ across the vector-treatment regions, with around 80 \% of birds
   being infected in both areas, and those infections were caused largely
   by a single strain, Plasmodium relictum SGS1. Although infected birds
   had a badge size not significantly different from uninfected males,
   there was a condition-dependent association between badge size,
   infection status and maternal testosterone deposition.
   Conclusions: This study illustrates that the complexity of temporal and
   ecological dimensions makes the relationships between disease,
   testosterone-related traits and secondary sexual signals that have been
   previously reported less general than thought.}},

Abstract = {{Melanin-based plumage ornaments have been shown to play an important
   role in male-male competition, but also influence inter-sexual
   communication. Consequently, ornaments may be associated with
   reproductive effort of both males and females. Females mated to males
   with larger melanin ornaments may acquire access to better territories
   or benefit from increased paternal care. Here we investigated whether
   the melanin-based breast-band of male and female Bar-throated Apalis
   Apalis thoracica is a signal of information about its bearer and is
   associated with male and female reproductive effort. Breast-band size
   was a highly variable morphometric trait in both sexes, but only in
   males was it associated with body mass. We then assessed whether male
   and female breast-band size predicted maternal and paternal investment.
   Egg mass increased with male breast-band size, but decreased with female
   breast-band size. Whether females adjust maternal hormone allocation in
   response to their partner's ornamentation remains a contentious issue.
   We found that yolk testosterone and androstenedione concentrations were
   not predicted by male ornamentation or body mass. Finally, males with
   larger breast-bands provided their mates with more food, allowing those
   females to spend more time incubating. Reproductive effort of both
   parents is therefore predicted by their own and their mate's
   ornamentation in Bar-throated Apalis, and thus breast-band size
   potentially acts as a signal of reproductive performance in both sexes.
   These results highlight the need for more comprehensive analyses of a
   relationship between melanin-based ornaments and fitness, incorporating
   multiple behavioural variables associated with reproductive effort.}},

Abstract = {{In oviparous species, preovulatory maternal effects such as investment
   in yolk quantity and composition or levels of yolk steroid hormones
   might potentially affect hatchling body sizes, growth rates,
   performance, and sex in species with temperature-dependent sex
   determination. We investigated the effects of egg mass and levels of
   testosterone and 17 beta-estradiol in the yolk on the phenotypes of
   hatchling Magdalena River Turtles (Podocnemis lewyana) in three
   populations in the Magdalena River drainage of northern Colombia. We
   hypothesized that, under homogeneous incubation conditions, the
   differences documented among clutches would be attributed to familial
   effects, caused by either heritable genetic factors or preovulatory
   maternal effects. Eggs were incubated artificially at the pivotal
   temperature for the species 33.4 degrees C) and hatchlings were reared
   in the laboratory for 2 mo. Two eggs from each clutch were tested for
   testosterone and 17 beta-estradiol Sex ratios, hatchling size, mass and
   rights times varied both between clutches within between populations.
   Egg mass Was positively related to hatchling body size and mass, both at
   hatching and at 2 mo of age. Levels of 17 beta-estradiol concentrations
   influenced hatching success rates and incubation periods. Sex ratios
   were marginally related to 17 beta-estradiol levels, with clutches and
   sites with higher levels tending to produce fewer males. Our results
   provide evidence that preovulatory maternal effects play a role in
   influencing phenotypic attributes related to hatchling survivorship such
   as size, growth rate, and performance, and also seem to interact with
   incubation temperature to determine the sex of each individual and the
   sex ratio of the clutch, which has implications for both parental and

   antioxidants or other egg compounds with laying order may thus reflect
   adaptive parental favouritism or maternal physiological constraints.
   Vitamins are found in the yolk at high concentrations and accomplish
   important physiological functions. Tocopherols (vitamin E') have major
   roles in antioxidant protection, but the consequence of variation in
   their concentration for chick phenotype has never been experimentally
   investigated under a natural selection regime. In the yellow-legged gull
   (Larus michahellis) free-ranging population we studied, vitamin E
   concentration and egg size decline from the first to the third (last)
   egg. Chicks from third eggs are smaller and have lower viability
   compared to those from sibling eggs. Here, we tested the effect of
   injecting a physiological dose of vitamin E in the egg yolk on chick
   body size at hatching by comparison with chicks from sham-injected eggs.
   As predicted, chicks from vitamin E injected third eggs were larger than
   chicks from control third eggs, whereas vitamin E had no effect on
   chicks from the other eggs. Thus, vitamin E injection disrupted the
   brood size hierarchy according to laying order normally found in this
   species. In species that adopt a brood reduction strategy, differential
   allocation of vitamin E to the eggs can contribute to establish a
   hierarchy of reproductive value among progeny members functioning to
   maximize parental fitness. The present results therefore have general
   implications for the study of the evolution of maternal effects mediated
   by transfer of potentially limiting maternal antioxidants to the eggs.}},

Abstract = {{Embryonic exposure to steroids often leads to long-term phenotypic
   effects. It has been hypothesized that mothers may be able to create a
   steroid environment that adjusts the phenotypes of offspring to current
   environmental conditions. Complicating this hypothesis is the potential
   for developing embryos to modulate their early endocrine environment.
   This study utilized the threespined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus)
   to characterize the early endocrine environment within eggs by measuring
   four steroids (progesterone, testosterone, estradiol, and cortisol) of
   maternal origin. We then examined how the concentrations of these four
   steroids changed over the first 12 days post fertilization (dpf).
   Progesterone, testosterone, estradiol, and cortisol of maternal origin
   could be detected within unfertilized eggs and levels of all four
   steroids declined in the first 3 days following fertilization. While
   levels of progesterone, testosterone, and estradiol remained low after
   the initial decline, levels of cortisol rose again by 8dpf. These
   results demonstrate that G. aculeatus embryos begin development in the
   presence of a number of maternal steroids but levels begin to change
   quickly following fertilization. This suggests that embryonic processes
   change the early endocrine environment and hence influence the ability
   of maternal steroids to affect development. With these findings, G.
   aculeatus becomes an intriguing system in which to study how selection
   may act on both maternal and embryonic processes to shape the
   evolutionary consequence of steroid-mediated maternal effects. J. Exp.

Abstract = {{Female birds may adjust their offspring phenotype to the specific
   requirements of the environment by differential allocation of
   physiologically active substances into yolks, such as androgens. Yolk
   androgens have been shown to accelerate embryonic development, growth
   rate and competitive ability of nestlings, but they can also entail
   immunological costs. The balance between costs and benefits of androgen
   allocation is expected to depend on nestling environment. We tested this
   hypothesis in a multibrooded passerine, the spotless starling, Sturnus
   unicolor. We experimentally manipulated yolk androgen levels using a
   between-brood design and evaluated its effects on nestling development,
   survival and immune function. Both in first and replacement broods, the
   embryonic development period was shorter for androgen-treated chicks
   than controls, but there were no differences in second broods. In
   replacement broods, androgen-treated chicks were heavier and larger than
   those hatched from control eggs, but this effect was not observed in the
   other breeding attempts. Androgen exposure reduced survival with respect
   to controls only in second broods. Regarding immune function, we
   detected nonsignificant trends for androgen treatment to activate two
   important components of innate and adaptive immunity (IL-6 and Ig-A
   levels, respectively). Similarly, androgen-treated chicks showed greater
   lymphocyte proliferation than controls in the first brood and an
   opposite trend in the second brood. Our results indicate that yolk
   androgen effects on nestling development and immunity depend on the
   environmental conditions of each breeding attempt. Variation in maternal
   androgen allocation to eggs could be explained as the result of
   context-dependent optimal strategies to maximize offspring fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal hormones are important mediators of prenatal maternal effects
   in animals. Although their effects on offspring phenotype are often
   sex-specific, the reason why sometimes sons are more sensitive to
   prenatal hormone exposure and sometimes daughters is not well
   understood. Here I combine an experimental manipulation of yolk
   testosterone concentration in the egg and quantification of selection
   acting on yolk androgen-sensitive traits in a natural population of
   great tits (Parus major) with a literature review to test the hypothesis
   that sex-specific selection on traits affected by yolk androgens
   determines which sex is more sensitive to prenatal hormone exposure. An
   experimental increase of the testosterone content in the egg boosted the
   post-hatching growth of male, but not female great tit nestlings.
   However, I found no evidence that survival selection on body mass or
   size is acting differently in the two sexes. A literature review
   revealed that yolk androgen manipulations affect the growth of males and
   females differently across species. Interestingly, in studies performed
   in the wild a significant association between the strength and direction
   of sexual size dimorphism and sex-specific sensitivities to yolk
   androgens was observed. In studies performed in captivity, no such
   relationship was found. Thus, across species there is some evidence that
   sex-specific selection on body size influences how strongly growth
   trajectories of males and females are affected by maternally-derived
   yolk androgens.}},

Abstract = {{Avian egg yolks contain various amounts of maternally derived androgens
   that can modify offspring phenotype and adjust their development to the
   post-hatching environment. Seemingly adaptive variation in yolk androgen
   levels with respect to breeding density conditions or male
   attractiveness has been found in numerous studies. One important
   consideration that has been overlooked in previous research is the
   likely non-linear nature of hormone effects. To examine possible complex
   dose-response effects of maternal androgens on chick development, we
   experimentally administered three different androgen doses of the
   naturally occurring mixture of yolk testosterone and androstenedione to
   spotless starling eggs (Sturnus unicolor). We found that yolk androgens
   induce a non-linear dose-response pattern in several traits. Androgens
   had a stimulatory effect on hatchling body mass and nestling skeletal
   growth, but maximum values were found at intermediate doses, whereas our
   highest dose resulted in a decrease. However, the opposite U-shaped
   effect was found on nestling body mass. We also detected linear negative
   and positive effects on embryonic development period and nestling gape
   width, respectively. Our results suggest differential tissue
   responsiveness to yolk androgens, which may result in compromises in
   maternal allocation to produce adapted phenotypes. Because of the
   non-linear dose-response pattern, future investigations should carefully
   consider a wide range of concentrations, as the balance of costs and
   benefits may strongly differ depending on concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal provisioning can have profound effects on offspring phenotypes,
   or maternal effects, especially early in life. One ubiquitous form of
   provisioning is in the makeup of egg. However, only a few studies
   examine the role of specific egg constituents in maternal effects,
   especially as they relate to maternal selection (a standardized
   selection gradient reflecting the covariance between maternal traits and
   offspring fitness). Here, we report on the evolutionary consequences of
   differences in maternal acquisition and allocation of amino acids to
   eggs. We manipulated acquisition by varying maternal diet (milkweed or
   sunflower) in the large milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus. Variation in
   allocation was detected by examining two source populations with
   different evolutionary histories and life-history response to sunflower
   as food. We measured amino acids composition in eggs in this 2x2 design
   and found significant effects of source population and maternal diet on
   egg and nymph mass and of source population, maternal diet, and their
   interaction on amino acid composition of eggs. We measured significant
   linear and quadratic maternal selection on offspring mass associated
   with variation in amino acid allocation. Visualizing the performance
   surface along the major axes of nonlinear selection and plotting the
   mean amino acid profile of eggs from each treatment onto the surface
   revealed a saddle-shaped fitness surface. While maternal selection
   appears to have influenced how females allocate amino acids, this
   maternal effect did not evolve equally in the two populations.
   Furthermore, none of the population means coincided with peak
   performance. Thus, we found that the composition of free amino acids in
   eggs was due to variation in both acquisition and allocation, which had
   significant fitness effects and created selection. However, although
   there can be an evolutionary response to novel food resources, females
   may be constrained from reaching phenotypic optima with regard to
   allocation of free amino acids.}},

Abstract = {{Intergenerational effects of stress have been reported in a wide range
   of taxa; however, few researchers have examined the intergenerational
   consequences of oxidative stress. Oxidative stress occurs in living
   organisms when reactive oxygen species remain unquenched by antioxidant
   defense systems and become detrimental to cells. In fish, it is unknown
   how maternal oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity influence
   offspring quality. The semelparous, migratory life history of Pacific
   salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) provides a unique opportunity to explore
   intergenerational effects of oxidative stress. This study examined the
   effects of population origin on maternal and developing offspring
   oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity, and elucidated
   intergenerational relationships among populations of sockeye salmon
   (Oncorhynchus nerka) with varying migration effort. For three
   geographically distinct populations of Fraser River sockeye salmon
   (British Columbia, Canada), antioxidant capacity and oxidative stress
   were measured in adult female plasma, heart, brain, and liver, as well
   as in developing offspring until time of emergence. Maternal and
   offspring oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity varied among
   populations but patterns were not consistent across tissue/developmental
   stage. Furthermore, maternal oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity
   did not affect offspring oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity
   across any of the developmental stages or populations sampled. Our
   results revealed that offspring develop their endogenous antioxidant
   systems at varying rates across populations; however, this variability
   is overcome by the time of emergence. While offspring may be relying on
   maternally derived antioxidants in the initial stages of development,
   they rapidly develop their own antioxidant systems (mainly glutathione)
   during later stages of development (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Influence of mate preference and laying order on maternal allocation in
   a monogamous parrot species with extreme hatching asynchrony}},
Journal = {{HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{49-59}},

Abstract = {{It is well established that in many avian species, prenatal maternal
   resource allocation varies both between and within clutches and may
   affect offspring fitness. Differential allocation of maternal resources,
   in terms of egg weight and yolk composition, may therefore allow the
   female to adjust brood reduction and to fine-tune reproductive
   investment in accordance with the expected fitness returns. The adaptive
   value of such maternal resource allocation is thought to be
   context-dependent as well as species-specific. We investigated the
   effects of female preference for her mate on the allocation of prenatal
   maternal resources in the budgerigar, Melopsittacus undulatus, a
   monogamous species of parrot that shows an extreme hatching asynchrony.
   We assessed mate preferences in a two-way preference test and allowed
   females two breeding rounds: one with the preferred and one with the
   non-preferred partner. We found no effect of preference on either
   latency to lay or clutch size, but females mated with the preferred
   partner laid eggs that contained significantly more yolk. Their eggs
   also contained significantly more androstenedione but not testosterone.
   Our results suggest that in this species, female preference may
   influence maternal resource allocation, and that the functional roles of
   each androgen in the yolk should be considered separately. In addition,
   we found a significant effect of laying order on egg and yolk weight as
   well as on yolk testosterone and androstenedione levels. These measures,
   however, did not change linearly with the laying order and render it
   unlikely that female budgerigars compensate for the extreme hatching
   asynchrony by adjusting within-clutch allocation of prenatal maternal
   resources. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A cross-fostering experiment reveals that prenatal environment affects
   begging behaviour in a cooperative breeder}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{251-258}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Prenatal breeding conditions have broad influences on maternal
   allocation to reproduction which can strongly affect future begging
   behaviours of offspring. The social environment is part of the prenatal
   environment; however, its influence on maternal allocation has been
   poorly investigated and experimental tests linking prenatal conditions
   to begging behaviour have seldom been conducted. In cooperative breeders
   the presence of additional carers, the helpers, generally predicts an
   increase in provisioning during the nestling stage. Since begging is
   costly, in these species producing offspring that beg less in the
   presence of helpers may be a way of saving energy not only for the
   offspring but also for the future survival and reproduction of females.
   To date, whether mothers may manipulate begging behaviour in relation to
   helper presence is unstudied. We conducted a cross-fostering experiment
   in a cooperatively breeding bird, the sociable weaver, Philetairus
   socius, to disentangle the possible effects of prenatal and postnatal
   environments on begging behaviour. Pre- and postnatal environments
   correspond here to the number of carers in the nest of origin and the
   foster nest, respectively. As predicted, begging was influenced by the
   prenatal environment, with nestlings originally from larger groups
   begging less. In addition, chicks fed by more foster birds also begged
   at a lower rate. We conclude that the prenatal environment influences
   begging behaviour. This result has important implications for
   understanding cooperative breeding strategies since producing offspring
   that beg less with more helpers may allow energy savings for females and
   related offspring and helpers. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of

   Common and Different Pathways of Maternal Effects in Japanese Quail}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Avian eggs contain a variety of maternally-derived substances that can
   influence the development and performance of offspring. The levels of
   these egg compounds vary in relation to environmental and genetic
   factors, but little is known about whether there are correlative links
   between maternal substances in the egg underlying common and different
   pathways of maternal effects. In the present study, we investigated
   genetically determined variability and mutually adjusted deposition of
   sex hormones (testosterone-T, androstenedione-A(4) and
   progesterone-P-4), antibodies (IgY) and antimicrobial proteins
   (lysozyme) in eggs of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica). We used
   different genetic lines that were independently selected for yolk T
   concentrations, duration of tonic immobility and social reinstatement
   behaviour, since both selections for behavioural traits (fearfulness and
   social motivation, respectively) produced considerable correlative
   responses in yolk androgen levels. A higher selection potential was
   found for increased rather than decreased yolk T concentrations,
   suggesting that there is a physiological minimum in egg T levels. Line
   differences in yolk IgY concentrations were manifested within each
   selection experiment, but no consistent inter-line pattern between yolk
   IgY and T was revealed. On the other hand, a consistent inverse
   inter-line pattern was recorded between yolk IgY and P-4 in both
   selections for behavioural traits. In addition, selections for
   contrasting fearfulness and social motivation were associated with
   changes in albumen lysozyme concentrations and an inverse inter-line
   pattern between the deposition of yolk IgY and albumen lysozyme was
   found in lines selected for the level of social motivation. Thus, our
   results demonstrate genetically-driven changes in deposition of yolk T,
   P-4, antibodies and albumen lysozyme in the egg. This genetic
   variability can partially explain mutually adjusted maternal deposition
   of sex hormones and immune-competent molecules but the inconsistent
   pattern of inter-line differences across all selections indicates that
   there are other underlying mechanisms, which require further studies.}},

Abstract = {{Resources and cues provided by the mother before birth are important
   mediators of developmental plasticity. It has been suggested that the
   adaptive value of such prenatal maternal effects may depend on the
   environment encountered by the offspring after birth, and that offspring
   may perform better when environmental conditions encountered by the
   mother and the offspring match, than when a mismatch occurs. Here, we
   test how prenatal maternal effects and postnatal conditions interact in
   influencing offspring growth and development in wild-living great tits
   (Parus major) by manipulating food availability experienced by the
   mother before egg laying, partially cross-fostering nestlings between
   nests, and manipulating food availability after hatching. We observed
   significant interaction effects between pre- and postnatal food
   conditions. Nonsupplemented nestlings reached a similar fledging mass, a
   trait closely linked to postfledging survival, as food-supplemented
   nestlings when their biological mother had received extra food during
   egg laying. It shows that prenatal maternal investment can compensate
   for growth-limiting conditions after hatching. This effect was sex
   specific, with daughters benefiting more than sons. Furthermore,
   food-supplemented nestlings grew largest when their biological mother
   had not received extra food during egg laying, suggesting that offspring
   were primed prenatally, possibly through differential egg composition,
   to use resources more efficiently. However, we found no evidence that
   offspring performed generally better when pre- and postnatal food
   conditions matched than when a mismatch occurred. Our results
   demonstrate the importance of considering the postnatal environment when
   testing for the ecological and evolutionary consequences of prenatal
   maternal effects in natural populations.Resources transferred by the
   bird mother via the egg help to reduce the negative consequences of a
   harsh environment after birth. Furthermore, mothers encountering harsh
   environmental conditions during egg laying prime their offspring to use
   available resources more efficiently later in life. Our study shows that
   the environment encountered before birth can have important long-term
   consequences on offspring performance and the way animals interact with
   their environment.}},

   (Ficedula albicollis) population, we show that natural selection acts in
   opposite ways on two maternally derived androgens, yolk androstenedione
   (A4) and yolk testosterone (T). High yolk A4 concentrations are
   associated with higher fitness, whereas high yolk T concentrations are
   associated with lower fitness. Natural selection thus favours females
   that produce eggs with high A4 and low T concentrations. Importantly,
   however, there exists a positive (non-genetic) correlation between A4
   and T, which suggests that females are limited in their ability to reach
   this adaptive optimum. Thereby, these results provide strong evidence
   for an adaptive value of differential maternal androgen deposition, and
   a mechanistic explanation for the maintenance of variation in maternal
   investment in the wild.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal allocation shapes offspring phenotype by being tailored to
   parental phenotype and offspring sex. Because melanogenesis and immunity
   have partly common genetic control, maternal effects via egg immune
   factors and parental melanization may covary. Here, we tested whether
   barn swallows Hirundo rustica allocated antibodies against a novel
   antigen to their eggs according to embryo sex depending on maternal
   melanin-based coloration while controlling for paternal tail
   ornamentation. Egg antibody concentration increased with maternal
   plumage darkness in broods with relatively more females, whereas it
   decreased in broods with relatively more males. Thus, darker females
   allocated more antibodies to their eggs when offspring sex ratio was
   female biased, whereas paler females allocated more antibodies to the
   eggs when offspring sex ratio was male biased. These effects were
   independent of laying order. Our results are compatible with the
   hypotheses that maternal allocation to sons depends on their
   reproductive value as predicted by heritable melanin-based coloration
   and with the hypothesis of differential susceptibility of pheomelanic
   daughters to parasitism. These effects may depend on pleiotropy of the
   genes that control melanogenesis and immunity, which may differentially
   act on investment in self-maintenance and maternal effects. This study
   is the first study in vertebrates of the association between maternal
   effects on either sex via egg quality and parental melanization. The
   links between the genetic control of melanogenesis and of major fitness
   traits like immunity and the role of maternal effects in reproductive
   strategies prompt for more studies of the covariation between parental
   coloration and maternal sex-dependent allocation via egg quality.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{79-87}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Maternal effects provide an important mechanism for mothers to create
   variation in offspring personality, and to potentially influence
   offspring life history strategies e.g. creating more/less dispersive
   phenotypes. However, within-clutch maternal effects often vary and hence
   there is potential for within-clutch variation in personality. We
   studied the effects of hatching order on explorative and neophobic
   behaviour of the magpies Pica pica in relation to sex using novel
   environment and novel object experiments. Hatching order did affect
   explorative behaviour in magpie, but did so in opposite directions for
   either sex. First-hatched females were more explorative and had a
   tendency to be less neophobic, whereas in males, the reverse was true.
   Our results suggest that hormonal as well as post-natal environmental
   mechanisms could be underpinning this pattern. Future research is needed
   to fully understand the importance of both in creating different
   offspring personalities. This article is part of a Special Issue

Abstract = {{Hormones of maternal origin transferred to the eggs of oviparous species
   have been shown to significantly affect offspring development.
   Furthermore, there is now increasing evidence that these effects may
   last into adulthood. This underlines the persistence of yolk
   hormone-mediated maternal effects as well as their trans-generational
   potential as these changes may involve fitness-related traits such as
   mate choice behaviour, reproductive traits and longevity. Here, we
   tested the potential of yolk testosterone to affect sexual selection by
   experimentally increasing the yolk testosterone levels via egg
   injections. We focused on two central axes of sexual selection,
   male-male competition for access to a female (intra-sexual selection)
   and female mate choice behaviour (inter-sexual selection), using
   canaries (Serinus canaria) as a model species. Neither male agonistic
   behaviour nor access to the opposite sex, as measured in staged
   male-male encounters in the presence of a female, were affected by
   experimentally elevating yolk testosterone levels. We did not find any
   evidence for effects on female mate choice behaviour either, given the
   lack of significant effects on mate choice activity, consistency in
   female mate choice or choosiness. In conclusion, our results indicate
   that the consequences of yolk testosterone for sexual selection through
   changes in behavioural traits, which are expressed during pair formation
   or male-male competition, are probably limited.}},

Title = {{Factors affecting the levels of protection transferred from mother to
   offspring following immune challenge}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: The transfer of antibodies from mother to offspring is key
   to protecting young animals from disease and can have a major impact on
   responses to infection and offspring fitness. Such maternal effects also
   allow young that may be exposed to disease in early life to focus
   resources on growth and development at this critical period of
   development. Maternally transferred antibodies are therefore an
   important source of phenotypic variation in host phenotype as well as
   influencing host susceptibility and tolerance to infection across
   generations. It has previously been assumed the transfer of antibodies
   is passive and invariant and reflects the level of circulating antibody
   in the mother at the time of transfer. However, whether females may vary
   in the relative amount of protection transferred to offspring has seldom
   been explored.
   Results: Here we show that females differ widely in the relative amount
   of specific blood antibodies they transfer to the embryonic environment
   (range 9.2\%-38.4\% of their own circulating levels) in Chinese painted
   quail (Coturnix chinensis). Relative transfer levels were unrelated to
   the size of a female's own immune response. Furthermore, individual
   females were consistent in their transfer level, both across different
   stages of their immune response and when challenged with different
   vaccine types. The amount of antibody transferred was related to female
   condition, but baseline antibody responses of mothers were not. However,
   we found no evidence for any trade-offs between the relative amount of
   antibody transferred with other measures of reproductive investment.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that the relative amount of
   antibodies transferred to offspring can vary significantly and
   consistently between females. Levels of transfer may therefore be a
   separate trait open to manipulation or selection with potential
   consequences for offspring health and fitness in both wild and
   domesticated populations.}},

Abstract = {{The environment mothers are exposed to has resonating effects on
   offspring performance. In iteroparous species, maternal exposure to
   stressors generally results in offspring ill-equipped for survival.
   Still, opportunities for future fecundity can offset low quality
   offspring. Little is known, however, as to how intergenerational effects
   of stress manifest in semelparous species with only a single breeding
   episode. Such mothers would suffer a total loss of fitness if offspring
   cannot survive past multiple life stages. We evaluated whether chronic
   exposure of female sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) to a chase
   stressor impaired offspring performance traits. Egg size and early
   offspring survival were not influenced by maternal exposure to the
   repeated acute stressor. Later in development, fry reared from stressed
   mothers swam for shorter periods of time but possessed a superior
   capacity to re-initiate bouts of burst swimming. In contrast to
   iteroparous species, the mechanisms driving the observed effects do not
   appear to be related to cortisol, as egg hormone concentrations did not
   vary between stressed and undisturbed mothers. Sockeye salmon appear to
   possess buffering strategies that protect offspring from deleterious
   effects of maternal stress that would otherwise compromise progeny
   during highly vulnerable stages of development. Whether stressed sockeye
   salmon mothers endow offspring with traits that are matched or
   mismatched for survival in the unpredictable environment they
   encountered is discussed. This study highlights the importance of
   examining intergenerational effects among species-specific reproductive
   strategies, and across offspring life history to fully determine the
   scope of impact of maternal stress.}},

   necessary nutrients for the development of the embryo. It is known that
   this type of maternal investment can be influenced by the quality of the
   male partner. In this study, we first verify that male song is important
   in the mate choice of female Eurasian reed warblers, as males mate
   faster when their singing is more complex. Furthermore, female egg
   investment varies in relation to male song characteristics.
   Interestingly, clutch size, egg weight, or size, which can be considered
   as an high-cost investment, is not influenced by male song
   characteristics, whereas comparably low-cost investment types like
   investment into diverse egg components are adjusted to male song
   characteristics. In line with this, our results suggest that female
   allocation rules depend on investment type as well as song
   characteristics. For example, egg white lysozyme is positively
   correlated with male song complexity. In contrast, a negative
   correlation exists between-song speed and syllable repetitiveness and
   egg yolk weight as well as egg yolk testosterone concentration. Thus,
   our results suggest that female egg investment is related to male song
   performance in several aspects, but female investment patterns regarding
   various egg compounds are not simply correlated.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal effects can result in transgenerational phenotypic plasticity,
   in which environmental variation experienced by mothers is translated
   into phenotypic variation in offspring. Although maternal effects have
   been a focus of much recent research, little is known about the
   long-term consequences of disturbance of the maternal social environment
   on offspring phenotype in socially monogamous and biparental species. We
   hypothesized that pair separation followed by re-pairing may generate
   maternal effects on offspring development. Here, we gave previously
   paired female zebra finches access to new males 6 days following removal
   of their original partner to assess experimentally the effects of
   re-pairing (an ecologically relevant form of social disturbance) on
   female reproductive investment, yolk corticosterone concentrations and
   subsequent offspring phenotype. Pair disruption boosted growth in female
   offspring and delayed the development of plumage colour sex dimorphism
   in males. Although yolk corticosterone concentrations were not affected
   by the treatment, offspring from treated mothers were less responsive to
   social isolation in a novel environment compared to control offspring.
   This is, to our knowledge, the first study demonstrating that maternal
   re-pairing prior to hatching has long-lasting effects on offspring
   phenotype in a socially monogamous and biparental species. Our results
   also suggest that prehatching maternal effects of this social
   disturbance are not mediated by maternal yolk corticosterone. Additional
   studies are required to determine the potential pathways of these
   maternal effects (e. g. other hormones, epigenetic programming,
   protein/nutrient content of eggs, etc.) and their adaptive value. (C)

Abstract = {{Egg components are important mediators of prenatal maternal effects in
   birds and other oviparous species. Because different egg components can
   have opposite effects on offspring phenotype, selection is expected to
   favour their mutual adjustment, resulting in a significant covariation
   between egg components within and/or among clutches. Here we tested for
   such correlations between maternally derived yolk immunoglobulins and
   yolk androgens in great tit (Parus major) eggs using a multivariate
   mixed-model approach. We found no association between yolk
   immunoglobulins and yolk androgens within clutches, indicating that
   within clutches the two egg components are deposited independently.
   Across clutches, however, there was a significant negative relationship
   between yolk immunoglobulins and yolk androgens, suggesting that
   selection has co-adjusted their deposition. Furthermore, an experimental
   manipulation of ectoparasite load affected patterns of covariance among
   egg components. Yolk immunoglobulins are known to play an important role
   in nestling immune defence shortly after hatching, whereas yolk
   androgens, although having growth-enhancing effects under many
   environmental conditions, can be immunosuppressive. We therefore
   speculate that variation in the risk of parasitism may play an important
   role in shaping optimal egg composition and may lead to the observed
   pattern of yolk immunoglobulin and yolk androgen deposition across
   clutches. More generally, our case study exemplifies how multivariate
   mixed-model methodology presents a flexible tool to not only quantify,
   but also test patterns of (co)variation across different organisational
   levels and environments, allowing for powerful hypothesis testing in
   ecophysiology.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal effects play an important role in mediating reproductive
   success; the different allocation of resources in eggs is considered a
   primary maternal effect. In oviparous vertebrates, there are several
   substances (hormones, immunoglobulins, antioxidants, antibacterial
   molecules) that females may allocate differentially. Mate choice is a
   key factor influencing female reproductive decisions and investment in
   eggs, but it is not clear to what extent the dominance status of the
   partner can influence the decision to invest differentially in the
   quality of eggs. In the grey partridge Perdix perdix, we ranked males
   for their social status after pairwise dominance tests. Then, females
   were paired experimentally with dominant or subordinate individuals. We
   measured testosterone, lysozyme and ovotransferrin concentrations in
   their eggs. Females paired with dominant males laid eggs with higher
   testosterone concentration, while egg mass, lysozyme and ovotransferrin
   concentrations did not differ. With regard to testosterone, because this
   hormone has been shown to elicit beneficial effects in offspring
   hatching from grey partridge eggs, our results are in line with the
   differential allocation hypothesis that females paired with high-quality
   males should invest more in the current reproductive event.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{18-24}},
Abstract = {{A broad variability of yolk androgen levels is considered as an
   important source of adaptive phenotypic plasticity. This variability of
   maternal androgen deposition is explained by environmental variation and
   also by genetic differences among avian mothers. We experimentally
   investigated such heritable variation of testosterone (T) levels in the
   egg through the bidirectional selection of Japanese quail. The response
   to selection for yolk T concentrations was evaluated in downward (low
   egg T, LET) and upward (high egg T, HET) directions over five
   generations. Moreover, the correlative response of circulating sex
   steroids to selection was examined by a comparison of plasma T and
   estradiol levels between the HET and LET females. We observed a distinct
   pattern of the response to selection in the HET and LET lines with the
   stronger response occurring in the upward direction and a limited
   potential for selection in the downward direction. In the HET line, the
   population mean increased more than double as compared to the initial
   population but it seems to be still below its plateau. The LET line
   reached the selection limit in the second generation suggesting that
   yolk T concentrations were close to their physiological minimum.
   Estradiol levels were higher in the circulation of the HET than LET
   females without changes in plasma T concentrations underlying specific
   control mechanisms for yolk and plasma hormone levels.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of avian species have shown that maternal effects mediated by
   the transfer of egg hormones can profoundly affect offspring phenotype
   and fitness. We previously demonstrated that the injection of a
   physiological amount of testosterone (T) in the eggs of ring-necked
   pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) disrupted the covariation among male
   morphological traits at sexual maturity and positively affected male
   mating success. Here, we investigate whether egg T exposure affected
   adult male circulating T levels at the onset of the breeding season
   (reflecting gonadal maturation), and the relationship between
   circulating T and male traits. Egg T exposure did not affect pre-mating
   plasma T. T levels were not associated with the expression of secondary
   sexual and non-sexual traits or socio-sexual behaviour (social rank,
   overall fighting ability and mating success). However, wattle brightness
   decreased with increasing circulating T in males hatched from T-eggs
   (T-males) but not among control males. In dyadic encounters during the
   peak mating period, control males with higher pre-mating T levels had
   higher chances of being dominant over other control males. However,
   higher pre-mating T levels did not predict success in male-male
   competition in encounters involving T-males. We suggest that the
   long-term effects of egg T on male phenotype do not originate from
   differential gonadal maturation according to egg T treatment. Rather,
   prenatal androgens may have priming effects on functioning of target
   tissues, translating into differential phenotypic effects according to
   androgen exposure during embryonic development.}},

Abstract = {{In the last two decades, maternally derived yolk androgens have been
   shown to significantly alter offspring development, and a number of
   these effects persist into adulthood. However, little is known about
   their underlying mechanisms. Mechanisms that have been suggested are
   changes in the endogenous androgen production post-hatching or changes
   in the sensitivity towards circulating androgens.
   We tested the effects of yolk testosterone on the plasma testosterone
   levels and the sensitivity to testosterone in 5 months old male canaries
   that hatched from eggs that were either injected with testosterone
   (yT-males) or with a control solution (yC-males). Changes in sensitivity
   were investigated via the behavioural response to an experimental
   elevation of the plasma testosterone levels. We performed the experiment
   in fall (low endogenous testosterone production), focusing on
   testosterone dependent response traits (aggression and song).
   Before implantation, there was a non-significant trend that the plasma
   testosterone levels were lower in yT-males than in yC-males. Elevating
   the plasma testosterone concentrations increased aggressiveness, song
   bout length and similarity of repeated song elements (=consistency),
   with the latter likely being a consequence of testosterone-driven song
   crystallization. However, these effects were not different among yT- or
   yC-males in any of the parameters. Thus, our findings render it unlikely

Abstract = {{1. This study aimed to evaluate a stress model induced by corticosterone
   (CORT) supplementation in the diet of broiler breeder hens.2. A total of
   60 Ross broiler breeder hens at 29 weeks of age were randomly divided
   into 4 groups with 15 hens each. The first group served as the control.
   The rest of the hens were given 1, 1.5 or 2mg of CORT/hen/d (CORT1,
   CORT1.5 and CORT2, respectively) for 7 d. Concentrations of yolk CORT,
   plasma uric acid, glucose, cholesterol, creatine kinase, heterophil
   (H):lymphocyte (L) ratio and duration of tonic immobility (TI) were
   measured at d 3, 5 and 7 of CORT supplementation. The same measurements
   were repeated at 3, 5 and 7 d after CORT was withdrawn from the diet.3.
   There were no significant CORT dose effect on yolk CORT and plasma
   glucose concentrations. Higher plasma uric acid and H:L ratio was
   obtained for CORT1.5 and CORT2 than for CORT1. From 3 to 7 d of dietary
   CORT supplementation, yolk CORT and plasma uric acid concentrations and
   H:L ratio increased whereas plasma glucose concentration decreased.
   After CORT was withdrawn from the diet, the H:L ratio remained elevated.
   The duration of TI and plasma creatine kinase concentration did not
   change during and after CORT supplementation.4. Yolk CORT concentration
   was correlated with plasma uric acid concentration during CORT
   supplementation.5. The results suggest that dietary CORT supplementation
   could be used as a stress model and to evaluate hormone-mediated
   maternal effects in broiler breeder hens.}},

Abstract = {{In birds, causes and consequences of variation in maternally-derived
   steroids in egg yolk have been the subject of intense experimentation.
   Many studies have quantified or manipulated testosterone ({''}T{''}) and
   one of its immediate precursors, androstenedione ({''}A4{''}) - often
   lumping the two steroids as ``androgens{''} and treating them as
   functionally equivalent. However, yolk A4 is deposited in substantially
   higher concentrations than T, binds only weakly to the androgen
   receptor, and is readily converted into either T or estrone by
   steroidogenic enzymes present during embryonic development. Thus it may
   not be appropriate to assume that A4 has the same effect as T. In
   addition, A4's metabolic fate is likely to differ between females and
   males. The goals of this study were to examine the sex-specific uptake
   and metabolism of yolk A4 and consequences of elevated levels of yolk A4
   on development and behavior of domestic chicks. Eggs were injected with
   2 mu Ci of tritiated androstenedione; radioactivity was detected in all
   tissues of day 7 and day 16 embryos and found in both aqueous and
   organics phases of day 7 yolk, with no difference between sexes. A
   second set of eggs was injected, with 125 ng of A4. A4 increased growth
   of morphological traits (tarsus, beak) in females, but not males. A4
   males had smaller combs than controls; there was no treatment effect in
   females. A4 reduced tonic immobility behavior in both sexes. The results
   of this study illustrate the importance of distinguishing both between
   androgens and between sexes when investigating avian endocrine maternal
   effects. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   efficiency in the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus)}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 23}},
Abstract = {{Elevated levels of maternal androgens in avian eggs affect numerous
   traits, including oxidative stress. However, current studies disagree as
   to whether prenatal androgen exposure enhances or ameliorates oxidative
   stress. Here, we tested how prenatal testosterone exposure affects
   oxidative stress in female domestic chickens (Gallus gallus) during the
   known oxidative challenge of an acute stressor. Prior to incubation,
   eggs were either injected with an oil vehicle or 5 ng testosterone. At
   either 17 or 18 days post-hatch, several oxidative stress markers were
   assessed from blood taken before and after a 20 min acute stressor, as
   well as following a 25 min recovery from the stressor. We found that,
   regardless of yolk treatment, during both stress and recovery all
   individuals were in a state of oxidative stress, with elevated levels of
   oxidative damage markers accompanied by a reduced total antioxidant
   capacity. In addition, testosterone-exposed individuals exhibited poorer
   DNA damage repair efficiencies in comparison with control individuals.
   Our work suggests that while yolk androgens do not alter oxidative
   stress directly, they may impair mechanisms of oxidative damage repair.}},

Journal = {{IBIS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{155}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{725-733}},

Abstract = {{As female birds are able to lay no more than a single egg each day, in
   those species producing larger clutches the first laid eggs may get a
   developmental head-start over later eggs in the clutch. All other things
   being equal, the differential pattern of development across the clutch
   may contribute to hatching asynchrony and subsequent inequity in the
   competition between brood mates, and ultimately increase variance in the
   quality and fitness of first- and last-laid offspring. It has been
   suggested that females might allocate resources differently across the
   laying sequence to moderate the developmental rate and hatching time of
   different embryos. We tested this theory in the Zebra Finch Taeniopygia
   guttata, a common model species for investigating maternal effects in
   birds. We removed 758 eggs from 160 nests shortly after they were laid
   and used artificial incubators to control for parental effects and
   monitor hatching times. Eggs from larger clutches consistently hatched
   sooner than those from average-sized clutches, demonstrating that the
   intrinsic properties of an egg can alter the developmental time of
   embryos. There were also differences in the development time of eggs
   across the laying sequence, but these patterns were weaker, inconsistent
   and unrelated to sequential investment across the laying sequence in a
   straightforward way. This study indicates that maternal resource
   allocation to eggs across the laying sequence and across clutch sizes
   can influence development times and play a potentially important role in
   determining the competitive dynamics of broods.}},

   An adaptive maternal effect?}},
Journal = {{HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{729-736}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Territorial animals breeding in high-density environments are more
   likely to engage in aggressive competition with conspecifics for
   resources necessary for reproduction. In many avian species, increased
   competition among breeding females results in increased testosterone
   concentrations in egg yolks. Generally, elevated yolk testosterone
   increases nestling growth, competitive behaviors, and bold behavioral
   traits. However, few studies provide an environmental context with which
   to examine the potential adaptive benefits of these phenotypic changes.
   In this study, tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) breeding density was
   altered to modify levels of social competition and yolk testosterone. We
   measured nestling growth, competitive ability, and breathing rate in
   response to a stressor using a partial cross-foster design. Females
   breeding at high-density experienced more aggressive, competitive
   interactions and their eggs had higher testosterone concentrations.
   Nestlings that hatched in high-density environments grew faster and
   displayed more competitive behaviors and a higher breathing rate
   response to a stressor regardless of post-hatching density. Our study
   demonstrates that phenotypic plasticity occurs in response to yolk
   testosterone variation resulting from different breeding densities.
   These findings suggest that naturally-induced maternal effects prepare
   offspring for competitive environments, supporting the idea that
   maternal effects are adaptive. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Females Paired with New and Heavy Mates Reduce Intra-Clutch Differences
   in Resource Allocation}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Reproductive investment affects both offspring and parental fitness and
   influences the evolution of life histories. Females may vary their
   overall primary reproductive effort in relation to the phenotypic
   characteristics of their mate. However, the effects of male quality on
   differential resource allocation within clutches have been largely
   neglected despite the potential implications for mate choice and
   population dynamics, especially in species exhibiting biparental care
   and brood reduction. Female southern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes
   chrysocome paired with heavy mates reduced intra-clutch variation in egg
   and albumen masses. Females paired with new mates also reduced
   intra-clutch variation in yolk androgen levels. Since both an increased
   mass and increased androgen concentrations positively influence chick
   survival under sibling competition, the chances of fledging the whole
   clutch are likely to be higher for newly formed pairs with heavy males
   than for previously formed pairs with light males. Interestingly, total
   clutch provisioning did not vary with male quality. We show for the
   first time that females vary intra-clutch variation in resource
   allocation according to male quality. In species with brood reduction,
   it may be more adaptive for females to modulate the distribution of
   resources within the clutch according to breeding conditions, than to
   change their total clutch provisioning.}},

Abstract = {{Birds can manipulate offspring sex ratio under natural and experimental
   conditions and maternal hormones have been shown to be involved in this
   process. Studies also provided evidence for the presence of sex specific
   concentrations of yolk hormones in avian eggs. These findings led to the
   suggestion that yolk hormones could influence genetic sex determination
   in birds. However, in previous studies, yolk hormone concentrations and
   egg sex were studied in incubated eggs, although incubation of the eggs
   and embryonic development can alter yolk hormone concentrations and
   measured sex ratio. This study is the first to determine a wide array of
   egg components and hen body weight in relation to the sex of the egg in
   unincubated eggs. Egg parameters studied were yolk concentrations of
   testosterone, estradiol, androstenedione, progesterone,
   dihydrotestosterone, and glucose, and egg weight and dimensions. In
   addition, we studied the associations among all measured parameters.
   Associations were found between a number of yolk hormones (progesterone
   associated with testosterone, estradiol and androstenedione;
   androstenedione with testosterone; dihydrotestosterone with estradiol
   and androstenedione) as well as between yolk testosterone and egg length
   and egg weight. There were no significant overall differences between
   male and female chicken eggs in any of the measured egg parameters.
   However, there were a few interactions such as the interaction of egg
   sex with dihydrotestosterone and with hen body weight which predicted
   estradiol levels and an interaction of estradiol levels with egg width
   for predicting sex of egg. Their biological relevance need, however,
   further study. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hatching asynchrony is widespread in birds laying clutches containing
   multiple eggs, yet is seemingly paradoxical as the age and size
   hierarchies result in asymmetric sibling competition and low survival
   prospects for late-hatched nestlings. We examined the causes of
   variation in hatching asynchrony between broods of zebra finch,
   Taeniopygia guttata, in three environments: domesticated, captive wild
   and wild free-living. We found that broods of both domesticated and wild
   birds taken into captivity hatched more asynchronously than wild
   free-living broods. This was directly attributable to both male and
   female parents of domesticated and captive wild broods initiating
   incubation as soon as the first egg was laid as opposed to when the
   clutch was virtually complete in wild free-living broods. Wild
   free-living birds that were transferred to captive environments
   immediately switched to the incubation onset behaviour seen in
   domesticated birds, thereby demonstrating a previously unsuspected level
   of intraspecific plasticity in incubation behaviour. This finding
   suggests that something about the captive environment is driving the
   early onset of incubation and contributing to an elevated level of
   hatching asynchrony in captive birds. Across all populations and
   environments males contributed almost equally to incubation, and the
   onset of incubation by males was highly coordinated with that of their
   partner. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{In species with biparental care, parents disagree evolutionarily over
   the amount of care that each of them is willing to provide to offspring.
   It has recently been hypothesised that females may try to manipulate
   their mates by modifying offspring begging behaviour through yolk
   hormone deposition, shifting the division of labour in their own favour.
   To test this hypothesis we first investigated how yellow-legged gull
   (Larus michaellis) parents feed offspring in relation to each component
   of complex begging behaviour and if feeding behaviour varies between
   sexes. Then we investigated the effect of yolk testosterone on chicks'
   begging by experimentally increasing yolk testosterone levels. Our
   results revealed that yolk testosterone has a component-specific effect
   on chicks' begging, specifically increasing the number of chatter calls.
   Parental feeding effort was influenced by the number of chatter calls
   emitted by chicks, but most importantly, the influence was stronger in
   male than in female parents. Moreover, chick body mass increased with
   the number of paternal feeds. In conclusion, these results show that
   female gulls may use yolk testosterone deposition to exploit their
   partners as predicted by the `Manipulating Androgen Hypothesis (MAH)'.

Abstract = {{According to the brood reduction hypothesis, parents adjust their brood
   size in response to current environmental conditions. When resources are
   abundant, parents can successfully raise all hatched offspring, but when
   resources are scarce, brood reduction, i.e., the sacrifice of some
   siblings to secure the quality of a subset of offspring, may maximize
   fitness. Differential transfer of maternal androgens is one potential
   proximate mechanism through which female birds may facilitate brood
   reduction because it may alter the relative competitive ability of
   sibling nestlings. We tested the hypothesis that female collared
   flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) manipulate sibling competition by
   transferring less androgens to eggs late in the laying sequence. We
   experimentally elevated androgen levels in i) whole clutches and ii)
   only the two last laid eggs, and compared growth and begging behavior of
   offspring from these treatments with a control treatment. By using three
   treatments and video assessment of begging, we examined the effects of
   within-clutch patterns of yolk androgen transfer on levels of sibling
   competition in situ. When androgens were elevated in only the two last
   laid eggs, begging was more even among siblings compared to control
   nests. We also found that female nestlings receiving additional yolk
   androgens showed higher mass gain later in the breeding season, while
   their male counterparts did not. Our results suggest that females may
   improve reproductive success in unpredictable environments by altering
   within-clutch patterns of yolk androgen transfer. We discuss the
   possibility that life-history divergence between the co-occurring
   collared and pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) is amplified by
   patterns of yolk androgen transfer. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Permanent offspring modification through maternal hormone transfer is
   thought to be a tool for mothers to influence life-history trajectories
   of individual offspring. In birds, yolk hormones influence numerous
   aspects of the offspring's physiology, including antioxidant status, an
   important physiological measure that is linked to growth, reproductive
   effort, and survival. While it is evident that yolk hormones can affect
   antioxidant status of nestlings, it is not known whether their effect
   extends beyond the nestling stage. In this study, we use the zebra finch
   (Taeniopygia guttata) to test experimentally whether exposure to
   elevated yolk testosterone (T) levels can result in long-term effects on
   antioxidant status and traits likely to be associated with this measure.
   Our data show a significant but sex-specific effect with respect to a
   period from fledging to the age of 7 mo; T males had higher antioxidant
   status than control males, whereas antioxidant levels did not differ
   among females and were intermediate compared with the two male groups.
   Bill color, a trait associated with carotenoids (a specific group of
   antioxidants) and known to be under the control of circulating levels of
   T, was not affected by our yolk T manipulation. Bill color (alone or in
   covariation with egg treatment or sex) did not predict immune
   responsiveness or antioxidant status. Moreover, there was only weak
   evidence that antioxidant status predicted the strength of different
   immune responses. Antioxidant status (in covariation with egg treatment
   and sex) predicted levels of circulating total antibody levels but did
   not predict the strength of cell-mediated and humoral immune responses.
   Our results suggest that yolk T affects antioxidant status independently
   of these other traits.}},

   characteristics that give rise to the origin of paternal, maternal, or
   bi-parental care from an ancestral state of no care. Females initially
   invest more into each egg than males. Despite this inherent difference
   between the sexes, paternal, maternal, and bi-parental care are equally
   likely when males and females are otherwise similar. Thus, sex
   differences in initial zygotic investment do not explain the origin of
   one pattern of care over another. However, sex differences in adult
   mortality, egg maturation rate, and juvenile survival affect the pattern
   of care that will be most likely to evolve. Maternal care is more likely
   if female adult mortality is high, whereas paternal care is more likely
   if male adult mortality is high. These findings suggest that basic
   life-history differences between the sexes can alone explain the origin
   of maternal, paternal, and bi-parental care. As a result, the influence
   of life-history characteristics should be considered as a baseline
   scenario in studies examining the origin of care.}},

Abstract = {{To explain the evolution of egg colouration in open cup nesting species,
   a number of functions have been suggested. Recent studies focus on the
   role of eggshell colour as a postmating sexually selected trait of
   females which manipulates male parental investment. A basic prediction
   of this hypothesis is that egg pigmentation reflects female quality. In
   this study we examine whether there is a relationship between eggshell
   colouration and either female quality or egg quality in reed warblers.
   This open cup nesting species has eggs that are heavily spotted with
   brownish marks on a bluish-green background. We used several parameters
   describing female and egg quality, and measured eggshell colouration at
   the blunt pole and the egg centre, deriving four colour variables from
   colour spectrometry. To determine egg quality parameters, the third egg
   of each clutch was sampled and analysed. To determine female quality,
   females were trapped shortly after egg laying, and several morphological
   and a single conditional variable were determined. Additionally, a blood
   sample was taken to determine blood parasites (avian malaria and
   Trypanosoma spp.) and a faecal sample to determine intestinal parasites
   (Isospora spp). Our results revealed that eggshell pigmentation appears
   to be independent of female condition and parasites, but reflects
   concentrations of egg compounds such as testosterone and lysozyme. Egg
   colouration is also related to yolk weight and egg size. Our results
   further suggested that the information about colour varies depending on
   the position on the egg (blunt pole or egg centre). The only
   relationship with females was between female size (tarsus length) and
   egg colouration, which suggests a genetic component. We discuss reasons
   for the absence of a relationship between egg colouration and female
   quality.}},

Abstract = {{Competing for food by altricial and semiprecocial bird nestlings is a
   behaviour well known for its sensitivity to maternal androgens during
   prenatal development. Whether a similar effect is present in precocial
   species that do not beg is less well known. We therefore increased yolk
   testosterone levels within the physiological range at the onset of
   incubation to study its effects on food competition behaviour in the
   domestic chicken, Gallus gallus domesticus. We found an increase in
   competitiveness in testosterone-treated male domestic chicks, raising
   their level to that of the females. This is in line with the decrease in
   circulating plasma levels of males in the direction of the levels in
   females, and the overall decrease in androgen receptor densities after
   prenatal treatment as found previously. Hormones are known to have
   long-lasting organizing effects on behaviour and to affect sexual
   differentiation in vertebrates. Although research into hormone-mediated
   maternal effects has been productive, only a few studies describe (the
   ambiguous) effects into adulthood. Therefore we followed our animals
   into adulthood and recorded androgen-dependent social behaviour and
   secondary sexual characteristics, body mass and circulating plasma
   testosterone levels and checked whether these variables were treatment
   dependent. Treatment had a near significant effect on comb colour (both
   brightness and chroma). Again treatment caused a shift towards a more
   female-like phenotype. This suggests that, in contrast to earlier
   suggestions, maternal androgens may interact with (but not disrupt)
   sexual differentiation of brain and behaviour and the development of
   secondary sexual characteristics. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study

   Breeding Sociable Weaver}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 25}},
Abstract = {{In egg laying species, breeding females may adjust the allocation of
   nutrients or other substances into eggs in order to maximise offspring
   or maternal fitness. Cooperatively breeding species offer a particularly
   interesting context in which to study maternal allocation because
   helpers create predictably improved conditions during offspring
   development. Some recent studies on cooperative species showed that
   females assisted by helpers produced smaller eggs, as the additional
   food brought by the helpers appeared to compensate for this reduction in
   egg size. However, it remains unclear how common this effect might be.
   Also currently unknown is whether females change egg composition when
   assisted by helpers. This effect is predicted by current maternal
   allocation theory, but has not been previously investigated. We studied
   egg mass and contents in sociable weavers (Philetairus socius). We found
   that egg mass decreased with group size, while fledgling mass did not
   vary, suggesting that helpers may compensate for the reduced investment
   in eggs. We found no differences in eggs' carotenoid contents, but
   females assisted by helpers produced eggs with lower hormonal content,
   specifically testosterone, androstenedione (A4) and corticosterone
   levels. Taken together, these results suggest that the environment
   created by helpers can influence maternal allocation and potentially
   offspring phenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{The hormonal environment an individual experiences during development
   can have lasting effects on behavior, morphology, and physiology.
   However, measuring endogenous hormone exposure during early embryonic
   development and relating it to adult phenotype has proved to be
   challenging. The relative length of digit 2 to digit 4 (2D:4D) in adults
   is thought to reflect the relative concentration of androgens and
   estrogens during development and has been used as a morphological proxy
   of developmental hormone exposure, enabling the exploration of the
   relationships between individual differences in hormone exposure and
   phenotype. Here, we use this approach and ask whether 2D:4D relates to
   the responsiveness of the adult hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and
   to sexually dimorphic structures (wing, tail, and tarsus length) in a
   common songbird, the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis). Among males, we
   found a negative relationship between 2D:4D and the ability to elevate
   testosterone in response to a physiological challenge, an injection of
   gonadotropin-releasing hormone. We also found age- and sex-specific
   relationships between 2D:4D and wing, tail, and tarsus length. We found
   a positive relationship between 2D:4D and body size measures in females,
   and second-year and older males, but a negative relationship in
   first-year males. We conclude that individual variation in exposure to
   developmental hormones, as reflected by 2D:4D, is correlated with adult
   hormone production ability and sexually dimorphic morphology in
   adulthood, suggesting that endogenous variation in steroid hormone
   exposure may have long-term consequences similar to those seen in
   experimental manipulations.}},

Abstract = {{The hormonal environment during early development, such as maternally
   derived androgens in bird eggs, shapes the development of the offspring
   in ways that may have important long-term consequences for phenotype and
   behavior and, ultimately, fitness. We studied the long-term effects of
   yolk androgens on several phenotypic and physiological traits in male
   and female pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) by experimentally
   elevating yolk androgen levels and rearing birds in common-garden
   environment in captivity. We found that high yolk androgen levels
   increased the basal metabolic rates in both females and males in
   adulthood. High yolk androgen levels did not affect male melanin
   coloration or plumage ornaments, or timing or speed of moult in either
   sex. No effect of androgen treatment on cell-mediated or humoral immune
   response was found in either sex. Covariation among the measured
   phenotypic traits was further not altered by androgen treatment. Our
   results suggest that exposure to high androgen levels can have
   long-lasting effects on some offspring traits, but do not seem to lead
   to different phenotypes. Furthermore, the role of yolk androgens
   affecting sexually selected male traits in our study species seems to be
   minor. The fitness consequences of yolk androgen-induced higher
   metabolic rates remain to be studied.}},

Abstract = {{Females choose their mate on the basis of secondary sexual characters
   such as physical ornaments, courtship behaviours or vocalizations. In
   male birds, vocalizations are known to increase their attractiveness and
   consequently their probability of copulation. Moreover, male songs have
   been shown to shape maternal investment, particularly with regard to egg
   quality. Artificial manipulation of male attractiveness has been found
   to affect female sexual preferences and maternal investment. In this
   regard, supranormal stimuli are thought to increase such responses. The
   present study was designed to assess whether supranormal acoustic
   stimuli, known to induce high levels of sexual responsiveness in female
   canaries, Serinus canaria, could increase maternal investment beyond
   levels observed in birds exposed to natural songs. Exposure to
   supranormal songs (G phrases) increased maternal investment: compared to
   females exposed to moderately attractive (Control) or naturally
   attractive (A) phrases. Females exposed to supranormal songs laid bigger
   eggs (egg volume and mass, albumen mass); moreover, females in the G
   group laid eggs with heavier yolks than females in the Control group. In
   contrast, no differences were found between groups with regard to
   testosterone deposition in the eggs. Thus, the adjustment of females'
   investment in their brood seems to take various forms that appear to be
   related to different features of males' sexually selected traits, which
   raises the questions of how and why these different mechanisms have been
   selected. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Title = {{Moderate Heat Challenge Increased Yolk Steroid Hormones and Shaped
   Offspring Growth and Behavior in Chickens}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{FEB 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Environmental challenges might affect the maternal organism
   and indirectly affect the later ontogeny of the progeny. We investigated
   the cross-generation impact of a moderate heat challenge in chickens. We
   hypothesized that a warm temperature-within the thermotolerance
   range-would affect the hormonal environment provided to embryos by
   mothers, and in turn, affect the morphology and behavioral phenotype of
   offspring.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Laying hens were raised under a standard
   thermal condition at 21 degrees C (controls) or 30 degrees C
   (experimental) for 5 consecutive weeks. A significant increase was
   observed in the internal temperature of hens exposed to the warm
   treatment; however plasma corticosterone levels remained unaffected. The
   laying rate was not affected, but experimental hens laid lighter eggs
   than the controls during the treatment. As expected, the maternal
   thermal environment affected yolk hormone contents. Eggs laid by the
   experimental hens showed significantly higher concentrations of yolk
   progesterone, testosterone, and estradiol. All chicks were raised under
   standard thermal conditions. The quality of hatchlings, growth, feeding
   behavior and emotional reactivity of chicks were analyzed. Offspring of
   experimental hens (C30 chicks) were lighter but obtained better
   morphological quality scores at hatching than the controls (C21 chicks).
   C30 chicks expressed lesser distress calls when exposed to a novel food.
   Unlike C21 chicks, C30 chicks expressed no preference for energetic
   food.
   Conclusion/Significance: Our findings suggest that moderate heat
   challenge triggers maternal effects and modulate the developmental
   trajectory of offspring in a way that may be adaptive. This suggests
   that the impact of heat challenges on captive or wild populations might
   have a cross-generation effect.}},

Abstract = {{Maternally-derived yolk androgens exhibit distinct among- and
   within-female variations but limited data refer to inter-seasonal
   changes of maternal hormones in the yolk. We investigated the deposition
   of yolk testosterone (T) across two laying cycles in Japanese quail. To
   test how genetically-determined differences influence between cycle
   variations in yolk androgens we compared females from low (LET) and high
   (HET) egg T lines at the end of the first and at the beginning of the
   second laying cycle after an induced moult. Line differences in yolk T
   levels exhibited high consistency exceeding two reproductive cycles.
   Yolk T concentrations increased in the second laying cycle in HET but
   not in LET females. Plasma T levels did not differ between cycles in
   both lines and no line differences were found either before or after the
   moult indicating the presence of mechanisms limiting the increase of T
   concentrations in the circulation. Differences in the yolk T levels were
   not accompanied by changes in the egg and yolk mass. The HET quail laid
   eggs with heavier eggshell than the LET quail. Our results demonstrate
   different abilities of mothers to deposit Tin their eggs over two
   reproductive seasons with expected consequences on the development of
   their progeny. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal effects can influence offspring phenotype with short- and
   long-term consequences. Yet, how the social environment may influence
   egg composition is not well understood. Here, we investigate how laying
   order and social environment predict maternal effects in the sociable
   weaver, Philetairus socius, a species that lives in massive communal
   nests which may be occupied by only a few to 100+ individuals in a
   single nest. This range of social environments is associated with
   variation in a number of phenotypic and life-history traits. We
   investigate whether maternal effects are adjusted accordingly. We found
   no evidence for the prediction that females might benefit from modifying
   brood hierarchies through an increased deposition of androgens with
   laying order. Instead, females appear to exacerbate brood reduction by
   decreasing the costly production of yolk mass and antioxidants with
   laying order. Additionally, we found that this effect did not depend on
   colony size. Finally, in accordance with an expected increased intensity
   of environmental stress with increasing colony size, we found that yolk
   androgen concentration increased with colony size. This result suggests
   that females may enhance the competitive ability of offspring raised in
   larger colonies, possibly preparing the offspring for a competitive
   social environment.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated whether among-sibling differences in the phenotypes of
   juvenile fish were systematically related to the position in the egg
   mass where each individual developed during oogenesis. We sampled eggs
   from the front, middle and rear thirds of the egg mass in female brown
   trout of known dominance rank. In the resulting juveniles, we then
   measured traits that are related to individual fitness: body size,
   social status and standard metabolic rate (SMR). When controlling for
   differences among females in mean egg size, siblings from dominant
   mothers were initially larger (and had a lower mass-corrected SMR) if
   they developed from eggs at the rear of the egg mass. However,
   heterogeneity in the size of siblings from different positions in the
   egg mass diminished in lower-ranking females. Location of the egg within
   the egg mass also affected the social dominance of the resulting
   juvenile fish, although the direction of this effect varied with
   developmental age. This study provides the first evidence of a
   systematic basis for among-sibling differences in the phenotypes of

Journal = {{AMERICAN NATURALIST}},

Volume = {{181}},

Abstract = {{In many species, embryos are exposed to maternal hormones in utero, in
   the egg, or in the seed. In birds, mothers deposit substantial
   testosterone into their eggs, which enhances competitive ability of
   offspring. These maternal testosterone concentrations vary
   systematically within clutches in different patterns and may enable
   mothers to adaptively fine-tune competitive hierarchies within broods.
   We performed a comparative analysis to investigate this hypothesis using
   a broad set of avian species. We expected species with small size
   differences among siblings (arising from small hatching asynchrony or
   slow growth rates) to aim for survival of the whole brood in good years
   and therefore compensate last-hatching eggs with relatively more
   testosterone. We expected species with large size differences among
   siblings (large hatching asynchrony or fast growth rates) to produce
   surplus young as insurance against failed offspring and to facilitate
   elimination of redundant surplus young by bestowing last-hatching eggs
   with relatively less testosterone. As predicted, we found that maternal
   testosterone compensation to last-hatching eggs is stronger when size
   differences among siblings become smaller. Maternal testosterone
   compensation to last-hatching eggs also correlated negatively with
   hatching asynchrony and growth rates. These findings provide evidence
   for correlated evolution of several maternal effects that together
   support different maternal reproductive strategies.}},

Title = {{Why Offspring in Nonhuman Families Differ}},
Journal = {{EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{493-512}},
Abstract = {{Offspring within families, both human and nonhuman, often differ. The
   obvious question is: Why? Work on psychological differences on children
   within human families has focused primarily on differences in the
   nonshared environment of contemporary siblings, though the precise
   location of this nonshared environment is still the subject of much
   debate. Here I explore the range of explanations for within-brood
   diversity from the perspective of nonhuman families, particularly birds
   that share certain key features with human families. I examine the role
   of social rank in creating a nonshared environment within the family,
   and present data from a model system (an altricial bird) to illustrate
   how different the effective environments experienced by offspring
   sitting side-by-side in the same confined physical space, tended by the
   same parents, and experiencing similar ecological variability, can be.
   These broodmates can effectively live in different worlds. I then
   briefly explore other sources of diversity among offspring in nonhuman
   families, including within brood genetic differences and non-genetic
   maternal (parental) effects that often covary with birth / hatching
   rank. Given the ubiquity and far-reaching consequences of maternal
   effects in nonhuman families, and some human data suggestive of similar
   patterns, it would seem worthwhile to explore the potential role of
   maternal effects in creating phenotypic diversity in psychological
   traits among children in human families.}},

Abstract = {{In general, avian species produce clutches of more than one egg.
   Differential investment in egg weight and hormone levels is possible and
   their effects on development and behaviour can be measured. Here we
   investigated changes in three hormones (testosterone, T;
   androstenedione, A(4) and progesterone, P-4) in the outer layer of yolks
   of infertile domestic goose eggs over the course of a laying season.
   There was a significant change in the concentration of all three
   hormones: T and P-4 increased in a linear manner across the season
   whilst A(4) increased until mid season and then steadily decreased. The
   correlation between T and P-4 (r=0.613, P<0.001), and between T and A(4)
   (r=0.746, P<0.001) were both positive, but the relationship between A(4)
   and P-4, while positive was not strong (r=0.379, P<0.001), although
   still significant. The increase in P-4 over the laying season is
   consistent with the transition from a laying to a broody state. The
   increase in T is consistent with a trade-off for the seasonal decline in
   egg weight.}},

Abstract = {{In birds, early exposure to steroid hormones deposited in egg yolks is
   hypothesized to result in long-lasting effects on brain and behavior.
   However, the long-term effects of maternal androgens on the development
   of social behavior, and whether these could interfere with the effects
   of the endogenous gonadal hormones that mediate sexual differentiation,
   remain poorly known. To answer these questions, we enhanced yolk
   testosterone by injecting testosterone (T) in oil into Japanese quail
   (Coturnix japonica) eggs prior to incubation. Vehicle-injected (V) eggs
   served as controls. From age 3 weeks to 8 weeks, sexual development was
   measured using morphological and physiological traits, and social
   behavior was measured, including male-typical sexual behavior. In
   females, treatment with testosterone boosted growth. Males from
   T-injected eggs developed an affiliative preference for familiar females
   and differed from V-injected males in the acoustic features of their
   crows, whereas sexual interest (looking behavior) and copulatory
   behavior were not affected. These long-lasting and sex-specific yolk
   testosterone effects on the development of dimorphic traits, but without
   disrupting sexual differentiation of reproductive behavior suggest
   potential organizational effects of maternal testosterone, but acting
   through separate processes than the endocrine mechanisms previously
   shown to control sexual differentiation. Separate processes could
   reflect the action of androgens at different times or on multiple
   targets that are differentially sensitive to steroids or develop at
   different rates. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sex allocation theory in vertebrates has greatly benefited from the
   recent advances in studies on the physiological mechanisms of birth sex
   ratio variation (e.g., maternal glucose, stress, and testosterone
   levels). The same physiological mechanisms may, however, also mediate
   permanent sex-specific effects on individuals after birth. Together with
   biased maternal postpartum investment on sex allocation, they can have
   long-term fitness consequences for the offspring. We studied whether
   maternal preconception levels of serum glucose and testosterone, and
   fecal corticosterone metabolites differently influenced male and female
   pup weight until weaning in field voles (Microtus agrestis). In this
   species, high maternal preconception serum glucose and testosterone
   levels have previously been associated with the excess of male pups at
   birth. Our results suggest that male, but not female, pup weight
   increases with higher maternal preconception testosterone level whereas
   high maternal serum glucose level promoted female pup weight only. The
   level of maternal fecal corticosterone metabolites was not related to
   pup weight in either sex. These findings suggest that in field voles the
   same physiological mechanisms influencing sex ratio at birth may also
   influence offspring postnatal weight; however, such influences can act
   in conflict, as seen in the case of maternal glucose level.}},

Abstract = {{Hormonally mediated maternal effects link maternal phenotype and
   environmental conditions to offspring phenotype. The production of
   lipid-rich maternal yolk precursors may provide a mechanism by which
   lipophilic steroid hormones can be transported to developing yolks, thus
   predicting a positive correlation between yolk precursors in mothers and
   androgen levels in eggs. Using rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes
   chrysocome), which produce a two-egg clutch characterized by extreme
   egg-size dimorphism, reversed hatching asynchrony and brood-reduction,
   we examined correlations between circulating concentrations of the
   primary yolk-precursor vitellogenin (VTG) and levels of yolk androgens.
   Previous work in Eudyptes penguins has shown that egg-size dimorphism is
   the product of migratory constraints on yolk precursor production. We
   predicted that if yolk precursors are constrained, androgen transport to
   developing yolks would be similarly constrained. We reveal positive
   linear relationships between maternal VTG and androgens in small A-eggs
   but not larger B-eggs, which is consistent with a migratory constraint
   operating on the A-egg. Results suggest that intra-clutch variation in
   total yolk androgen levels depends on the production and uptake of yolk
   precursors. The brood reduction strategy common to Eudyptes might thus
   be best described as the result of a migratory constraint.}},

Abstract = {{We incubated eggs of the Japanese gecko Gekko japonicus at three
   temperatures, and measured yolk testosterone (T) and 17 beta-estradiol
   (E2) levels at three time points in embryonic development (oviposition,
   1/3 of incubation, and 2/3 of incubation), to examine whether maternal
   influence on offspring sex via yolk steroid hormone deposition is
   significant in the species. Eggs incubated at 24 A degrees C and 32 A
   degrees C produced mostly females, and eggs incubated at 28 A degrees C
   almost a 50:50 sex ratio of hatchlings. Female-producing eggs were
   larger than male-producing eggs. Clutches in which eggs were incubated
   at the same temperature produced mostly same-sex siblings. Yolk T level
   at laying was negatively related to eggs mass, and yolk E2/T ratio was
   positively related to egg mass. Results of two-way ANOVA with incubation
   temperature and stage as the factors show that: yolk E2 level was higher
   at 32 A degrees C than at 24 A degrees C; yolk T level was higher,
   whereas yolk E2/T ratio was smaller, at 28 A degrees C than at 24 A
   degrees C; yolk E2 and T levels were higher at 2/3 than at 1/3 of
   incubation. Our data in G. japonucus show that: (1) maternal influence
   on offspring sex via yolk steroid hormone deposition is significant; (2)
   incubation temperature affects the dynamics of developmental changes in
   yolk steroid hormones; (3) influences of yolk steroid hormones on
   offspring sex are secondary relative to incubation temperature effects;

Abstract = {{Differential resource allocation by females across the laying sequence
   has been hypothesised as a mechanism through which females could either
   compensate nestlings that hatch last in asynchronous broods or promote
   brood reduction. In this study we artificially incubated eggs and
   cross-fostered offspring to manipulate nestlings' position in the
   hatching order, to identify whether the competitive ability of nestlings
   is dependent on position in the laying sequence. In both control and
   experimentally reversed broods, first hatched chicks had a higher
   survival than last hatched siblings. Yet, nestlings that hatched from
   eggs laid in the second half of a clutch begged with a greater intensity
   than nestlings hatched from eggs laid in the first half of a clutch. In
   natural broods, the greater begging competitiveness of nestlings from
   later-laid eggs led to a moderation of sibling competition and these
   nestlings achieved the same body size and weight as nestlings from eggs
   laid in the first half of the clutch. The lack of a substantial
   difference in the size and condition of surviving nestlings in respect
   to laying order suggests that differential resource allocation across
   the egg-laying sequence partially compensates for hatching last in
   asynchronous broods and reduces the negative effects of the nestling
   size hierarchy. The effect of laying order, brood size and experimental
   treatment also differed for male and female nestlings. Our study
   highlights the need to be aware of the complex and subtle effects of
   nestling sex and laying sequence when investigating genetic and
   environmental influences on individual fitness.}},

Abstract = {{1. Longevity is a major determinant of individual differences in
   Darwinian fitness. Several studies have analyzed the stochastic,
   time-dependent causes of variation in longevity, but little information
   exists from free-ranging animal populations on the effects that
   environmental conditions and phenotype early in ontogeny have on
   duration of life. 2. In this long-term (19932011) study of a migratory,
   colonial, passerine bird, the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica), we
   analyzed longevity and, in a subsample of individuals, lifetime
   reproductive success (LRS) of the offspring that reached sexual maturity
   in relation to hatching date, which can affect the rearing environment
   through a seasonal deterioration in ecological conditions. Moreover, we
   analyzed the consequences of variation in body size and, for the first
   time in any species, of a major component of immunity on longevity, both
   by looking at absolute phenotypic values and at deviations from the
   brood mean. 3. Accelerated failure time models showed that individuals
   of both sexes that hatched early in any breeding season enjoyed larger
   longevity and larger LRS, indicating directional selection for early
   breeding. Both male and female offspring with large T cell-mediated
   immune response relative to their siblings and female nestlings that
   dominated the brood size/age hierarchy had larger longevity than their
   siblings of inferior phenotypic quality/age. Conversely, absolute
   phenotypic values did not predict longevity. 4. Frailty modelling
   disclosed marked spatial heterogeneity in longevity among colonies of
   origin, again stressing the impact of rearing conditions on longevity.
   5. This study therefore reinforces the notion that perinatal environment
   and maternal decisions over timing and site of breeding, and position in
   the brood hierarchy can have marked effects on progeny life history that
   extend well into adulthood. In addition, it provides the first evidence
   from any bird population in the wild that immune response when nestlings
   predicts individuals longevity after sexual maturation.}},

Abstract = {{Early growth conditions, such as exposure to maternally derived
   androgens in bird eggs, have been shown to shape offspring in ways that
   may have important long-term consequences for phenotype and behavior.
   Using an experimental approach, we studied the long-term effects of yolk
   androgens on several phenotypic traits and parental behavior in adult
   and female collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis). We elevated yolk
   androgen levels and monitored the experimental recruits the following
   breeding seasons. Androgen treatment had a sex-dependent effect on adult
   body condition, yolk androgen-treated males being heavier than control
   males when controlling for size, a result which may be caused
   potentially by selective mortality, physiological differences, or
   different life-history strategies. Androgen treatment did not however
   affect the expression of sexually selected plumage ornaments (forehead
   and wing patch size), UV coloration, or parental feeding rate in either
   sex. Our results suggest that yolk androgens are unlikely to affect
   sexual selection via plumage characteristics or contribute to breeding
   success via altered parental care. Yolk androgens do not seem to act as
   a means for female collared flycatchers to enhance the attractiveness of
   their sons. The lower return rate previously observed for
   androgen-treated male offspring compared to controls may therefore not
   be due to lower mating or breeding success, but may rather reflect lower
   survival or higher dispersal propensity of yolk androgen-treated males.}},

Abstract = {{The differential allocation hypothesis proposes that females mated to
   attractive males should invest more resources in their offspring than
   those mated to less-attractive males, whereas the compensation
   hypothesis posits that females mated to less-attractive males should
   invest more resources in their offspring to compensate for lower-quality
   young. We tested these hypotheses by manipulating attractiveness of male
   house wrens (Troglodytes aedon) prior to female arrival by adding extra
   nest sites to territories of some males while leaving control males with
   only a single nest site. Females laid their eggs sooner in the nests of
   attractive males, and attractive males were more likely to retain their
   territory over successive broods and were marginally more likely to
   obtain a mate for a second brood later in the season than were control
   males, thereby confirming the effect of our manipulation on male
   attractiveness. Experimentally enhanced attractiveness also led to
   increased hematocrit in males. However, there were no consistent
   differences in the number, size, or quality of eggs laid by females
   mated to attractive and control males, nor were there any differences in
   the size, health state, or immune function of nestlings produced from
   these eggs. There was also no effect of treatment on the number of
   nestlings surviving to fledging. Collectively, these results are
   inconsistent with both the differential allocation hypothesis and the
   compensation hypothesis. Future studies should consider the possibility
   that the criteria used by females in selecting a mate may vary
   temporally and be more flexible than generally thought.}},

Title = {{Environmental effects shape the maternal transfer of carotenoids and
   vitamin E to the yolk}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{AUG 9}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Maternal effects occur when the phenotype of the offspring
   is influenced by the phenotype of the mother, which in turn depends on
   her heritable state as well as on influences from the current and past
   environmental conditions. All of these pathways may, therefore, form
   significant sources of variation in maternal effects. Here, we focused
   on the maternal transfer of carotenoids and vitamin E to the egg yolk,
   using canaries as a model species. Maternal yolk carotenoids and vitamin
   E are known to generate significant phenotypic variation in offspring,
   representing examples of maternal effects. We studied the
   intra-individual consistency in deposition patterns across two years and
   the mother-daughter resemblance across two generations in order to
   estimate the level of heritable variation. The effects of the current
   environmental conditions were studied via a food supplementation
   experiment, while the consequences of past environmental conditions were
   estimated on the basis of the early growth trajectories.
   Results: There was a significant effect of the current environmental
   conditions on the yolk carotenoid and vitamin E deposition, but this
   effect varied between antioxidant components. The deposition of yolk
   carotenoids and vitamin E were linked to the process of yolk formation.
   Past environmental conditions did not contribute to the variation in
   yolk carotenoid and vitamin E levels nor did we find significant
   heritable variation.
   Conclusions: The transfer of carotenoids or vitamin E may be an example
   where current environmental variation is largely passed from the mother
   to the offspring, despite the numerous intermediate physiological steps
   that are involved. Differences in the effect of the environmental
   conditions as experienced by the mother during laying may be due to
   differences in availability as well as physiological processes such as
   competitive exclusion or selective absorption.}},

Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{1. Early growth conditions, for example hormonal environment during
   embryonic development, may have long-lasting effects on behaviour and
   phenotype, with subsequent fitness consequences. Yolk androgens have
   been shown to affect various offspring traits in the short-term, but
   fitness consequences for either offspring or parents, a prerequisite for
   studying the adaptiveness of this maternal effect, are poorly known in
   the wild. 2. We experimentally elevated yolk androgen levels of whole
   clutches in a wild population of collared flycatchers (Ficedula
   albicollis) and investigated the long-term effects of yolk androgens on
   offspring local recruitment, parental return rate, and timing and
   success of breeding in both parents and offspring in the breeding
   season(s) following the manipulation. 3. Yolk androgen elevation lowered
   the local recruitment rate of male, but not female offspring, but had no
   effect on any breeding parameters of offspring of either sex.
   Furthermore, yolk androgen elevation of the clutch had no effect on the
   return rate or any breeding parameters of the parents. 4. Our results
   indicate that high yolk androgen levels may impose a potential direct
   fitness cost for male offspring, but no long-lasting additional indirect
   fitness costs for parents (direct costs of transferring androgens to
   eggs not considered). Such a sex-specific cost on offspring could
   constrain yolk androgen deposition and select for sex-specific
   deposition mechanisms. 5. As yolk androgen levels in this population are
   heritable, our results on long-term fitness effect of yolk androgens
   support the idea that hormone-mediated maternal effects may evolve under
   selection and thereby affect evolutionary processes.}},

Title = {{Seasonal interactions between photoperiod and maternal effects determine

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{948-958}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{1. When predictable seasonal changes affect offspring fitness, we expect
   offspring to evolve phenotypes that minimize the costs of seasonal
   variation in timing of breeding. For species with parental care during
   embryonic development, offspring receive seasonal cues of the
   environment from parents that are biased by their parent's fitness
   (which is not equivalent to offspring fitness). Therefore, mechanisms
   enabling offspring to detect environmental cues independent of parents
   should be strongly favoured. 2. We experimentally evaluated the ability
   of avian embryos to integrate cues of season from photoperiod and
   maternal environments present in eggs to produce seasonal variation in
   phenotypes among Franklin's gull (Leucophaeus pipixcan) hatchlings. Eggs
   were collected early and late in the season and some were separated into
   their component parts and others were incubated under short (early
   season) and long (late season) photoperiods. After hatching, we measured
   the structural size of the chicks and the amount of yolk sac reserves.
   3. We found that hatchling size, a phenotype linked with fitness, is
   sensitive to both egg contents provided by mothers and photoperiod, and
   development time decreases across the season. The effects of integrating
   cues of season from eggs and photoperiod on offspring phenotype are
   complex, and when cues of season from eggs are mismatched with cues of
   season from photoperiod, alternate phenotypes are created. 4. We also
   found that seasonal variation in egg size, yolk, albumen or shell
   content of the eggs do not account for the seasonal maternal egg effect
   on hatchling size. This seasonal maternal effect could be a result of
   other egg constituents or reflect heritable variation in timing of
   breeding that is linked with offspring size. 5. Changes in breeding
   phenology of adults could result in a mismatch between cues from parents
   and photoperiod cues of season. For example, if breeding seasons
   advanced such that late season birds initiate breeding at an early
   season photoperiod, offspring would then be integrating maternal cues of
   late season with photoperiod cues of early season and alter their
   phenotypes. We expect our results to initiate new studies on how
   vertebrate embryos integrate environmental cues with maternal effects
   and offspring responses to optimize the expression of offspring
   phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{The levels of maternal androgens in egg yolk vary considerably within
   and among clutches. In most species studied to date, high levels have
   been found to increase offspring competitive ability. We measured yolk
   testosterone in two populations of Redpolls (Carduelis
   flammea/hornemanni) nesting around Toolik Lake Field Station and in
   Barrow, Alaska to test three predictions about the patterns of yolk
   testosterone concentrations. First, we predicted yolk testosterone to
   increase with laying sequence so as to minimize the deleterious effects
   of hatching asynchrony on chicks from later hatched eggs in a species
   without delayed incubation. Second, we predicted yolk testosterone to be
   higher in Barrow where food is more abundant and Redpoll body condition
   is higher. Third, we predicted yolk testosterone to correlate positively
   with egg mass and yolk mass, which are two other indicators of maternal
   investment. An initial analysis that did not consider egg and yolk mass
   lent support to the first of these predictions. However, more thorough
   statistical analysis revealed that relationships between yolk
   testosterone and laying sequence and between yolk testosterone and site
   were not direct but rather driven by associations among yolk
   testosterone, egg mass, and yolk mass. While yolk testosterone
   concentration itself did not differ between sites, the relationship
   between yolk testosterone and egg and yolk mass did. Yolk testosterone
   correlated positively with egg mass at Barrow and showed a significant
   quadratic association with yolk mass in Toolik. While laying sequence
   and yolk testosterone appeared to be correlated when egg and yolk mass
   were not considered, the full statistical model suggests that egg and
   yolk mass are directly associated with laying sequence while yolk
   testosterone concentrations are not. These results suggest complicated
   relationships among egg mass, yolk mass, yolk testosterone, site, and
   laying sequence that should be taken into account in future studies.
   They also suggest that deposition of yolk testosterone may be a
   regulated rather than being a purely passive process.}},

Abstract = {{Carotenoid-based ornaments (many yellow-orange-red colourations) may
   signal the genetic or parental quality of the bearer. Thus, their
   expression could influence the amount of resources/energy that the mate
   will invest in the production of offspring, thereby optimising its
   reproductive fitness. The differential allocation hypothesis (DAH)
   predicts that females mated with more attractive males should lay more
   and better eggs. This has been explored only in few bird species with
   carotenoid-based traits. We tested this hypothesis in the red-legged
   partridge (Alectoris rufa), a gallinacean with very variable laying
   capacity. Both sexes display carotenoid-based ornamentation that
   gradually fades throughout the laying period. Here, the redness of beak
   and eye rings of captive males was intensified after mating by means of
   paint. The proportion of females that laid eggs did not differ between
   treatments. Amongst laying females, those mated with colour-enhanced
   males (experimental females) tended to lay earlier and produced
   significantly more eggs than controls, but of similar quality (egg mass
   and composition). We additionally investigated whether male
   attractiveness influenced egg components depending on the clutch size
   and laying sequence. The testosterone level in eggs from experimental
   females was positively related to the laying order, whereas control eggs
   did not show any trend. Our results provided mixed support for the DAH,
   but nevertheless revealed that female red-legged partridges may adjust
   their breeding investment according to male carotenoid-based
   ornamentation.}},

Abstract = {{Oviparous amniotes, particularly birds, have become model systems in
   which to study how mothers may utilize steroids to adaptively adjust
   offspring development. Although there is now ample evidence that
   maternally derived steroids in the egg at oviposition can influence
   offspring phenotype, very little is known about how these steroids
   elicit such effects. Of the major avian steroid hormones found in yolk,
   progesterone is by far the most abundant at oviposition, but has
   received little research attention to date. In this study, we examine
   the metabolism of {[}H-3]-progesterone injected into freshly laid
   European starling eggs throughout the first 5 days of development by
   characterization of radioactivity within the egg homogenate. We also
   introduce a technique that utilizes a focal, freeze/thaw cycle to
   prevent embryonic development and allows us to assess the role of the
   embryo in metabolizing progesterone during early incubation. Two major
   findings result. First is that {[}H-3]-progesterone is metabolized in
   eggs possessing a developing embryo, but not in eggs with disrupted
   embryonic development. Second is that the change in the distribution of
   radioactivity within eggs possessing an embryo is the result of
   metabolism of {[}H-3]-progesterone to a more polar form that is
   subsequently conjugated. Together, these data suggest live embryos are
   necessary for metabolism of progesterone during early incubation,
   underscoring the potentially important contribution of embryos to
   functional modulation or mediation of maternal yolk steroid effects. (C)

Abstract = {{Eggs of oviparous amniotes can contain substantial quantities of several
   steroids at the time of oviposition. These maternally derived steroids
   appear to affect the phenotype of developing offspring, but not all
   steroid sensitive traits are affected by maternal steroids, and little
   is known about how these effects may arise. In this study, we applied
   tritiated estradiol to the eggs of red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta)
   at the time of oviposition and characterized the subsequent metabolism
   and movement throughout embryonic development. Results indicate that
   very early in development, estradiol is converted to a variety of
   water-soluble estrogen sulfates that reside in the yolk and
   extraembryonic fluids until late in development. Within the final stages
   of development, we observe a significant decline in the total amount of
   metabolites present in the yolk and extraembryonic fluids and a
   significant increase in the amount of metabolites present in the embryo.
   While estradiol metabolism occurs during the early stages of
   development, the later stages appear to be the most dynamic with regards
   to the movement of estradiol metabolites. Our findings have important
   implications for studies investigating the effect of maternally derived
   steroids on offspring development. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Early embryonic exposure to maternal glucocorticoids can broadly impact
   physiology and behaviour across phylogenetically diverse taxa. The
   transfer of maternal glucocorticoids to offspring may be an inevitable
   cost associated with poor environmental conditions, or serve as a
   maternal effect that alters offspring phenotype in preparation for a
   stressful environment. Regardless, maternal glucocorticoids are likely
   to have both costs and benefits that are paid and collected over
   different developmental time periods. We manipulated yolk corticosterone
   (cort) in domestic chickens (Gallus domesticus) to examine the potential
   impacts of embryonic exposure to maternal stress on the juvenile stress
   response and cellular ageing. Here, we report that juveniles exposed to
   experimentally increased cort in ovo had a protracted decline in cort
   during the recovery phase of the stress response. All birds, regardless
   of treatment group, shifted to oxidative stress during an acute stress
   response. In addition, embryonic exposure to cort resulted in higher
   levels of reactive oxygen metabolites and an over-representation of
   short telomeres compared with the control birds. In many species,
   individuals with higher levels of oxidative stress and shorter telomeres
   have the poorest survival prospects. Given this, long-term costs of
   glucocorticoid-induced phenotypes may include accelerated ageing and
   increased mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure of mothers to risk of predation can induce phenotypic changes
   in offspring as shown in several species. We previously found that
   cross-fostered great tit (Parus major) chicks of females exposed to
   increased predation risk were smaller and lighter, but had faster wing
   growth than control cross-fostered chicks, possibly improving
   predator-escaping abilities. Here we examined the possible role of
   maternal steroids deposited in eggs as an underlying mechanism. We
   collected eggs from female great tits under either experimentally
   increased predation risk (PRED) or control treatments (CON) and analyzed
   the concentration of testosterone, androstenedione, and progesterone in
   the yolks. PRED eggs contained lower levels of testosterone than CON
   eggs, but levels of androstenedione and progesterone did not differ. The
   smaller size and mass of chicks found in the previous study may thus be
   explained by the lower testosterone concentrations, since yolk
   testosterone is known to boost growth and development. Alternatively,
   testosterone may act as a modulator of differential investment into
   morphological traits, rather than a simple growth enhancer, explaining
   lower body mass in conjunction with the accelerated wing growth. This
   could possibly occur concurrently with other hormones such as
   corticosterone. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Females are expected to partition resources between offspring in a
   context-dependent way to maximise total fitness returns from a
   reproductive attempt. Female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) vary
   the allocation of yolk androgens and antioxidants among offspring.
   Importantly, the balance between androgens and antioxidants in yolks may
   be more important than their independent absolute amounts in terms of
   fitness consequences for developing young. Therefore, we tested whether
   the relative allocation of these two resources in yolks varies according
   to either the Trivers-Willard, positive or compensatory maternal
   investment hypothesis. We manipulated male attractiveness using coloured
   leg bands (red-banded males appear attractive; green-banded males,
   unattractive) and measured yolk androgens and antioxidants in each egg,
   egg sex, clutch sex ratio and female condition. While female zebra
   finches manipulated the balance of androgens and antioxidants within and
   between clutches in response to mate attractiveness, offspring sex and
   their own condition, they did not do so in a way that consistently
   followed any of the hypotheses. Mothers paired with unattractive males
   allocated a larger antioxidant/androgen ratio to daughters than sons.
   This pattern was reversed when paired to an attractive male; sons
   received a larger antioxidant/androgen ratio than daughters. We also
   found offspring sex ratio decreased with increasing female condition for
   unattractive males, but not for attractive males. However, without
   knowing the fitness consequences of the balance of different egg
   constituents, it is difficult to interpret the patterns consistently in
   terms of the Trivers-Willard, compensatory and positive investment
   hypotheses.}},

Abstract = {{Egg composition varies both within and between clutches, and mothers are
   expected to alter their deposition of resources to the egg depending on
   environmental conditions and breeding strategies. Within-clutch
   variation in egg composition has been proposed to reflect an adaptive
   maternal strategy influencing sibling competition. In species with brood
   reduction, mothers should reinforce brood hierarchies due to hatching
   asynchrony and favour senior chicks by making first-laid eggs larger,
   richer in nutrients, with higher testosterone and carotenoid levels and
   lower corticosterone concentrations than last-laid eggs {[}parental
   favouritism hypothesis (PFH)]. Moreover, mothers that are of better
   quality and/or experience better feeding conditions during laying are
   expected to increase their deposition of resources to the egg, resulting
   in differences between clutches {[}investment hypothesis (PFH)]. Several
   components may act together to provide an optimal reproductive strategy,
   but studies of variation in different egg components in the same egg are
   relatively rare. We analysed egg size, testosterone and corticosterone
   concentrations and carotenoids measured as yolk colour between and
   within clutches for the facultative siblicidal Black-legged Kittiwake
   Rissa triclactyla. First-laid eggs were larger, contained lower
   testosterone, higher yolk colour score, and similar corticosterone
   levels than last-laid eggs. Thus, only differences in egg size and yolk
   colour supported the PFH. We used within-clutch egg size dimorphism as
   an indicator of the quality of the mother or the feeding conditions
   during laying. In support of the IH, we found that mothers of better
   quality or that experienced better feeding conditions deposited more
   corticosterone into their eggs. High corticosterone levels may benefit
   nestlings when there is no brood reduction but high sibling competition
   is present. We found no support for the hypothesis that egg components
   are mutually adjusted to each other and we discuss the possible reasons
   for this.}},

Abstract = {{In many bird species with hatching asynchrony, yolk androgens increase
   across the laying sequence. This has been hypothesized to represent a
   compensatory mechanism for disadvantages of later-hatching chicks - via
   positive effects of yolk androgens on early competitiveness and growth.
   However, the costs and benefits of this compensatory strategy probably
   depend on environmental factors determining the survival chances of the
   chicks such as the food conditions, which should, therefore, influence
   maternal yolk androgen deposition. We studied the consequences of
   manipulated food conditions on the expected level of hatching asynchrony
   in canaries (Serinus canaria) assigning females to either a low (=LQ) or
   high quality (=HQ) diet.
   We measured the incubation behaviour (as incubation attendance) and the
   yolk androgen deposition in order to investigate whether and how females
   modulate hatching asynchrony in relation to the food conditions.
   Females on a HQ diet laid larger and heavier clutches, showed a stronger
   increase in yolk testosterone content towards the last-laid eggs, but
   did not alter their incubation attendance. Thus, females on a HQ diet
   seem to favour the survival of later hatching chicks, as indicated by
   their yolk testosterone deposition pattern. However, females on a HQ
   diet laid larger clutches and might need to compensate more in order to
   achieve a similar degree of hatching asynchrony than females on a LQ
   diet, given the lack of plasticity in incubation attendance. This
   suggests that canary females respond to food manipulations mainly via
   changes in clutch size rather than by altering the degree of hatching
   asynchrony. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of maternal androgens on fitness-related traits of offspring
   are generally assumed to be epigenetic adaptations to the environment
   that may be encountered by the next generation. Possible constraints of
   high yolk androgen transfer are still not understood, although a
   suppressed immune response in offspring is frequently considered. The
   aim of our study was to examine the innate immune defence in high (HET)
   and low egg testosterone (LET) lines of Japanese quail, which differ in
   the hormonal milieu of their eggs, thus providing a good physiological
   model for the study of androgen-mediated maternal effects. Acute phase
   response was induced by a lipopolysaccharide injection in 12-day-old
   quail and plasma corticosterone and the heterophil: lymphocyte ratio
   were measured at 1 and 3 h post-treatment. Basal levels of non-specific
   antibodies (IgY) were determined in the circulation. We found that HET
   quail were heavier than LET quail from the second week of age,
   indicating enhanced post-hatching growth. At 1 h post-lipopolysaccharide
   challenge, plasma corticosterone concentrations increased in the HET but
   not in the LET line. The heterophil: lymphocyte ratio rose in both lines
   at 3 h post-immune challenge, with a more pronounced response in HET
   quail. Moreover, HET chicks displayed higher IgY levels than LET chicks,
   suggesting either enhanced passive immunoprotection or stimulated
   endogenous antibody production. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that
   the genetic selection for high egg testosterone content positively
   influences growth and, simultaneously, does not limit the acute phase
   response in young quail.}},

Abstract = {{Hormones are potent mediators of developmental programming and maternal
   epigenetic effects. In vertebrates, developmental exposure to maternal
   androgen hormones has been shown to impact multiple behavioral and
   physiological traits of progeny, but the possible consequences of this
   early exposure in terms of aging-related changes in mortality and
   fitness remain largely unexplored. Avian eggs naturally contain variable
   doses of maternal hormones-in particular, androgens-which have
   documented effects on embryo growth and differentiation as well as adult
   behavior and physiology. Here, we report that injections of a
   physiological dose of testosterone (T) into yolks of freshly laid eggs
   of a small, seasonally breeding songbird, the house sparrow (Passer
   domesticus), increased survivorship in a semi-natural aviary
   environment. In addition, survival effects of developmental T exposure
   were sex-dependent, with males generally having a higher risk of death.
   Separate analyses for young birds in their first year of life (from
   hatching up to the first reproductive period the following calendar
   year) and in adulthood (after the first breeding season) showed similar
   effects. For first-year birds, mortality risk was higher during the
   winter than during the period after fledging; for adults, mortality risk
   was higher during the reproductive than the non-reproductive phase
   (post-breeding molt and winter). T treatment did not affect nestling
   body mass, but resulted in higher body mass at 3-4 months of age; T and
   body mass at this age interacted to influence mortality risk. Embryonic
   exposure to maternal testosterone may result in lower adult mortality by
   modifying intrinsic physiological processes involved in health or aging
   over the lifespan of adult birds.}},

Abstract = {{Parents, and particularly mothers, can influence their offspring's
   development in non-genetic ways. Maternal effects can occur during the
   mothering phase as well as during the embryonic phase. Prenatal maternal
   effects in birds can be mediated by yolk steroid hormones that influence
   subsequent offspring development. Studies have focused mainly on the
   influence of laying females' living conditions on yolk hormonal
   contents, and rarely on the effects of individual characteristics. Here,
   we investigated prenatal influence of parent age on yolk steroid levels
   and on offspring phenotype. We compared Japanese quail at two different
   ages: at the beginning of their reproductive cycle (11 weeks old: age 1)
   and six months later, after egg production peak (37 weeks old: age 2).
   Egg composition, reproductive outcomes, and offspring growth, sexual
   development and behaviour were studied at both ages. We found that
   laying rate, fertility and chick survival rates declined between age 1
   and age 2. Age 2 eggs had relatively lighter shells and higher yolk plus
   albumen contents; they also had lower testosterone contents. Age 2
   offspring weighed more at hatching than did age 1 offspring;
   subsequently their growth patterns differed and their sexual development
   was more precocious. Age 2 offspring were less emotional than age 1
   offspring when encountering a novel environment, and they appeared more
   sensitive to social separation. Our study shows, for the first time in a
   bird species, a strong impact of parental age on offspring phenotype,
   and especially on behaviour, an impact that is possibly mediated via
   modulation of yolk testosterone content. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Maternal effects occur when the phenotype of the mother affects the
   phenotype of their offspring. They are thought to have evolved to
   translate the environmental conditions experienced by the mother into
   adaptive phenotypic variation of the offspring. However, the integration
   of environmental cues allowing adaptive responses requires some form of
   plasticity that depends on the interaction of the maternal phenotype and
   her environment. In birds, maternal yolk hormones represent such a
   pathway for maternal effects, and their adaptive significance depends
   thus on the plasticity in maternal yolk hormone deposition.
   We studied sources of variation in yolk testosterone deposition,
   focusing on the often neglected contribution of the (partly heritable)
   maternal phenotype. We investigated consistency and heritability of yolk
   testosterone deposition in captive canaries of which the F(1) generation
   was raised in foster nests and analyzed the potential effects of the
   early developmental conditions. We found significant female consistency
   across years in egg mass, yolk mass and total amount of yolk
   testosterone but not in yolk testosterone concentrations. Females varied
   the yolk testosterone concentrations of their eggs across years mainly
   via changes in yolk mass. The heritable variation in egg mass, yolk mass
   and amount of yolk testosterone but not yolk testosterone concentrations
   was within the range of previous studies, but not significantly
   different from zero. Finally, the growth of the daughters as nestling
   had a significant effect on their yolk testosterone deposition at
   adulthood indicating the transgenerational potential for environmental
   effects - via the effects of yolk hormones on offspring development. (C)

Title = {{Pre- and postnatal environmental effects as potential sources of
   variation in neophobic behaviour in canaries}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{149}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{849-867}},
Abstract = {{Neophobia, the fear of new objects or stimuli, has been shown to be
   affected by both maternal effects and the environmental conditions
   experienced during development. However, both pathways have so far only
   been studied in isolation, even though maternal effects are known to
   have significant effects on early development. Thus, maternal yolk
   hormones - an important mediator of maternal effects - may affect
   neophobia both through direct effects on neophobic behaviour and/or by
   affecting the early development. Both pathways may even act in concert.
   We measured the neophobic response and habituation to novel food, as
   well as the response to a novel object in 8-months-old canaries (Serious
   canaria). All birds hatched from eggs with elevated yolk testosterone
   levels or control-treated eggs, and grew up in distinct
   experimentally-manipulated positions within the sibling hierarchy, which
   allowed us to test whether and how the effects of prenatally elevated
   yolk testosterone levels on neophobic behaviour vary with the
   environmental conditions experienced post-hatch. Neither the
   experimentally-manipulated yolk testosterone levels nor the position
   within the sibling hierarchy had a direct effect on neophobic behaviour.
   The elevation of the yolk testosterone levels modulated the neophobic
   behaviour and the habituation to novel situations of juvenile canaries
   only in interplay with the experimentally manipulated position in the
   sibling hierarchy and offspring sex. The strongest increase of neophobic
   behaviour was observed in individuals that hatched from eggs with
   elevated yolk testosterone content while growing up in a superior
   position in the sibling hierarchy - and in males. However, these effects
   varied with the focal explanatory variable. Based on our results and a
   review of the literature, we conclude that neither prenatal maternal nor
   early environmental effects post-hatching form the main source of
   variation of neophobia in itself, but that the effects observed as well
   as the inconsistency thereof can best be explained by the interaction of
   different partly unknown pathways.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Hatching asynchrony in avian species generally leads to a size hierarchy
   among siblings, favouring the first-hatched chicks. Maternally deposited
   hormones affect the embryo and chick's physiology and behaviour. It has
   been observed that progesterone, a hormone present at higher levels than
   other steroid hormones in egg yolks, is negatively related to body mass
   in embryos, chicks and adults. A differential within-clutch progesterone
   deposition could therefore be linked to the size hierarchy between
   siblings and to the resulting brood reduction. We tested whether yolk
   progesterone levels differed between eggs according to future parental
   ability to feed the entire clutch in wild rockhopper penguins Eudyptes
   chrysocome. This species presents a unique reversed egg-size dimorphism
   and hatching asynchrony, with the larger second-laid egg (B-egg)
   hatching before the smaller first-laid egg (A-egg). Yolk progesterone
   levels increased only slightly with female body mass at laying. However,
   intra-clutch ratios were not related to female body mass. On the other
   hand, yolk progesterone levels increased significantly with the date of
   laying onset for A-eggs while they decreased for B-eggs. Early clutches
   therefore had proportionally more progesterone in the B-egg compared to
   the A-egg while late clutches had proportionally less progesterone in
   the B-egg. We propose that females could strategically regulate yolk
   progesterone deposition within clutches according to the expected food
   availability during chick growth, an adaptive strategy to adjust brood
   reduction to conditions. We also discuss these results, relating to yolk
   progesterone, in the broader context of other yolk steroids.}},

Abstract = {{Zebra finches have played a central role in the discovery of a variety
   of maternal effects over the past decade, with females shown to adjust
   resource allocation to their eggs in response to variables such as the
   appearance of their partner, their own condition, and the diet on which
   they are maintained. In addition to being the focus of some of the most
   high profile individual studies that have influenced maternal effects
   research in birds, the multitude of zebra finch studies together provide
   the most comprehensive set of data to illuminate general patterns and
   compare different maternally derived variables. Surprisingly, to date,
   virtually all of this work has focused on captive populations of the
   zebra finch that have been domesticated for many generations, and which
   are typically held under relatively constant environmental and dietary
   conditions. Here we report the first data on resource allocation across
   the egg laying sequence in a free-living wild population. Reassuringly
   we find that the patterns that have been found in the majority of
   studies of domesticated populations with respect to investment across
   the laying sequence were all present in the wild population. The size
   and mass of eggs increased through the laying sequence whilst the
   concentration of carotenoids significantly decreased across the laying
   sequence. Although there was no significant pattern with respect to
   testosterone across the laying sequence the first two eggs had a higher
   level of testosterone than the last few eggs in the clutch, which is
   also consistent with the findings of earlier studies in captive
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal yolk hormones in bird eggs are thought to adjust the offspring
   to the post-hatching environment. This implies that the effects of
   maternal yolk hormones should vary with the post-hatching environment,
   but to date such context-dependency has largely been ignored. We
   experimentally increased yolk testosterone concentrations in canary eggs
   and simultaneously manipulated the post-hatching context via an
   experimental tick-infestation of the chicks. This allows us to evaluate
   the context-dependency of hormone-mediated maternal effects, as it has
   previously been shown that ectoparasites alter the maternal yolk
   androgen deposition. The experimental tick infestation reduced growth in
   chicks from sham-treated eggs, indicating harmful effects of this
   ectoparasite in canaries. Chicks from testosterone-treated eggs were not
   affected in their development by ticks, suggesting lower ectoparasite
   vulnerability. But this may also be due to the fact that experimentally
   elevated yolk testosterone levels impaired growth even under
   parasite-free conditions. This contrasts previous studies, but these
   studies often manipulated first laid eggs, while we used eggs of
   subsequent laying positions. Later laid eggs are presumably of lower
   quality and contain higher yolk testosterone concentrations. Thus, the
   effects of elevated yolk testosterone on growth may be dose-dependent or
   vary with the egg quality, suggesting prenatal context-dependency. J.

Abstract = {{Background: Maternal effects mediated by egg size and quality may
   profoundly affect offspring development and performance, and mothers may
   adjust egg traits according to environmental or social influences. In
   avian species, context-dependency of maternal effects may result in
   variation in egg composition, as well as in differential patterns of
   covariation among selected egg components, according to, for example,
   position in the laying sequence or offspring sex. We investigated
   variation in major classes of egg yolk components (carotenoids, vitamins
   and steroid hormones) in relation to egg size, position in the laying
   sequence and embryo sex in clutches of the Yellow-legged Gull (Larus
   michahellis). We also investigated their covariation, to highlight
   mutual adjustments, maternal constraints or trade-offs in egg
   allocation.
   Results: Laying sequence-specific patterns of allocation emerged:
   concentration of carotenoids and vitamin E decreased, while
   concentrations of androgens increased. Vitamin A, estradiol and
   corticosterone did not show any change. There was no evidence of
   sex-specific allocation or covariation of yolk components.
   Concentrations of carotenoids and vitamins were positively correlated.
   Egg mass decreased along the laying sequence, and this decrease was
   negatively correlated with the mean concentrations of carotenoids in
   clutches, suggesting that nutritionally constrained females lay low
   quality clutches in terms of carotenoid content. Finally, clutches with
   smaller decline in antioxidants between first-and last-laid eggs had a
   larger increase in yolk corticosterone, suggesting that a smaller
   antioxidant depletion along the laying sequence may entail a cost for
   laying females in terms of increased stress levels.
   Conclusions: Since some of the analyzed yolk components (e. g.
   testosterone and lutein) are known to exert sex-specific phenotypic
   effects on the progeny in this species, the lack of sex-specific egg
   allocation by mothers may either result from trade-offs between
   contrasting effects of different egg components on male and female
   offspring, or indicate that sex-specific traits are controlled primarily
   by mechanisms of sexual differentiation, including endogenous hormone
   production or metabolism of exogenous antioxidants, during embryonic
   development.}},

Abstract = {{An animal's emotional responses are the result of its cognitive
   appraisal of a situation. This appraisal is notably influenced by the
   possibility of an individual to exert control over an aversive event.
   Although the fact that environment controllability decreases emotional
   responses in animals is well established, far less is known about its
   potential trans-generational effects. As the levels of avian yolk
   hormones can vary according to the mother's environment, we hypothesized
   that housing environment of mothers would modulate the quality of her
   eggs and in turn her offspring's behaviour. Two groups of female
   japanese quail were constituted: a group that had access to a place to
   hide in their home-cage (Hd, n = 20) and a group that had nowhere to
   hide (NoHd, n = 20) when stressed. Both groups were submitted to daily
   human disturbances for a twenty-day-period. Hd females produced eggs
   with both less testosterone and androstenedione than did NoHd females.
   The emotional and social reactivity of Hd female's offspring were lower
   and their growth wes slower than those of NoHd females' offspring. Our
   results show that a minor difference in housing environment had
   substantial effects on eggs and offspring. The presence of a shelter
   probably helped quail to cope with daily human disturbances, producing
   less reactive offspring. This transgenerational effect caused by an
   opportunity to hide could lead to applications in care of laboratory
   animals, conservation biology and animal welfare.}},

Abstract = {{Transfer of maternal hormones to the eggs is a major source of offspring
   phenotypic variation. The developmental and organizational effects of
   egg hormones can extend into adulthood and affect behavioral and
   morphological traits involved in sexual and reproductive behavior, with
   important consequences for offspring fitness. In this study, we injected
   testosterone (T) in egg albumen of captive ring-necked pheasant
   (Phasianus colchicus) eggs. We then assessed the consequences for chick
   growth, cell-mediated immunity, and multiple male secondary sexual
   traits at maturity by comparison with a control group. We also compared
   the covariation between traits in the two experimental groups. We found
   that control males had redder wattles than males from T-injected eggs,
   suggesting that attractiveness and reproductive success of the offspring
   might vary depending on maternal transfer of T to the eggs. T treatment
   also modified the covariation between cell-mediated immunity and wattle
   coloration and between the area of the wattle and the expression of
   another secondary sexual trait, the ear tufts. These effects are likely
   to translate into fitness differences among the offspring if mate
   acquisition depends on the simultaneous expression of several traits
   that are differentially affected by the same maternal contribution.
   Maternal effects mediated by egg hormones might affect the fitness of
   the offspring not only by directional modification of phenotypic traits,
   but also by facilitating or inhibiting their covariation. This suggests
   the possibility that female choice based on the relative expression of
   multiple secondary sexual traits exerts a pressure on how maternal
   transfer of androgens contributes to developmental programs.}},

Abstract = {{Lindstrom (in Trends Ecol Evol 14:343-347, 1999) synthesized knowledge
   about ``early development and fitness in birds and mammals{''},
   interesting tracks and challenges for future studies. Today, there is
   unambiguous evidence that Lindstrom's first statement holds in
   long-lived birds: ``It is obvious that adverse environmental conditions
   might have immediate effects {[}aEuro broken vertical bar].{''} However,
   whether there are ``long-term fitness consequences of conditions
   experienced during early development{''} (Lindstrom's second statement)
   is unclear for long-lived birds. The extent to which the disadvantage of
   frail individuals at independence is expressed predominantly in terms of
   higher mortality and disappearance from the population before
   recruitment, or persists after recruitment, is still an open question.
   Due to the rarity of relevant data and the fact that most studies are
   retrospective, heterogeneity in methods and timescales hampers the
   identification of general patterns. Nevertheless, several studies have
   provided evidence of a relationship between early conditions and future
   reproductive parameters, or lifetime reproductive success. Evidence from
   large mammals suggests substantial long-term individual and population
   effects of early conditions, including trans-generational maternal
   effects. Evidence from short-lived birds also suggests long-term
   individual consequences, and maternal effects have been documented in
   long-lived ones. Despite logistical and financial difficulties inherent
   in long-term studies, they are the only way of addressing Lindstrom's
   second statement. Existing long-term longitudinal datasets should be
   re-analyzed using recently developed capture-mark-recapture models
   handling state uncertainty and unobservable heterogeneity in
   populations. Statistical methods designed to estimate lifetime
   reproductive success or incorporate pedigree information in standard
   situations of studies of wild vertebrates with imperfect detection offer
   new opportunities to assess long-term fitness consequences of early
   development in long-lived birds.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of yolk androgens on postnatal growth of offspring have been
   widely studied but their physiological role in the growth control is not
   fully understood due to an inconsistency in obtained results. We
   investigated androgen-mediated maternal effects on postnatal growth in
   relation to endocrine control mechanisms using two lines of Japanese
   quail divergently selected for high (HET) and low (LET) egg testosterone
   (T) content. Embryonic growth did not differ between the lines. During
   the growth period HET quail were heavier and displayed longer tarsi as
   compared with LET quail, with more pronounced line differences in males
   than females. HET males were heavier than LET males from the age of 2
   weeks, reached the age of maximum growth rate earlier, and displayed
   higher asymptotic body weight than LET males. Accelerated growth in HET
   males was not accompanied by increased postembryonic plasma T
   concentrations. Plasma triiodothyronine levels did not differ between
   lines while plasma thyroxine levels were decreased in HET as compared
   with LET female chicks. Line differences in body weight disappeared in
   adult quail suggesting that yolk androgens, increased in a physiological
   way, resulted in stimulation of juvenile growth rate in precocial
   Japanese quail under stable social and environmental conditions. (c)

Abstract = {{Despite considerable research on hormone-mediated maternal effects in
   birds, the underlying physiology remains poorly understood. This study
   investigated a potential regulation mechanism for differential
   accumulation of gonadal hormones in bird eggs. Across vertebrates,
   glucocorticoids can suppress reproduction by downregulating gonadal
   hormones. Using the chicken as a model species, we therefore tested
   whether elevated levels of plasma corticosterone in female birds
   influence the production of gonadal steroids by the ovarian follicles
   and thus the amount of reproductive hormones in the egg yolk. Adult
   laying hens of two different strains (ISA brown and white Leghorn) were
   implanted subcutaneously with corticosterone pellets that elevated
   plasma corticosterone concentrations over a period of nine days. Steroid
   hormones were subsequently quantified in plasma and yolk.
   Corticosterone-implanted hens of both strains had lower plasma
   progesterone and testosterone levels and their yolks contained less
   progesterone and testosterone. The treatment also reduced egg and yolk
   mass. Plasma estrogen concentrations decreased in white Leghorns only
   whereas in both strains yolk estrogens were unaffected. Our results
   demonstrate for the first time that maternal plasma corticosterone
   levels influence reproductive hormone concentrations in the yolk.
   Maternal corticosterone could therefore mediate environmentally induced
   changes in yolk gonadal hormone concentrations. In addition, stressful
   situations experienced by the bird mother might affect the offspring via
   reduced amounts of reproductive hormones present in the egg as well as
   available nutrients for the embryo.}},

Abstract = {{Large inter-species differences have been found in yolk corticosterone
   amounts in avian eggs. While some studies have failed to detect
   significant amounts of corticosterone, in other species high amounts
   have been recorded, such as in a recent study of southern rockhopper
   penguins Eudyptes chrysocorne chrysocome. However, attention has been
   drawn recently to the fact that many antibodies for corticosterone
   measurement cross-react with other steroids present in the yolk. In
   particular, progesterone and related substances can occur in yolk in
   high concentrations, such that also low cross-reactions of
   corticosterone assays may lead to measurement errors. We thus performed
   high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analyses of yolk extracts
   and determined the concentration of immunoreactive corticosterone, as
   well as cross-reacting progesterone and cortisol in egg yolks of
   southern rockhopper penguins and imperial shags Phalacrocorax atriceps
   albiventer. We found that high gestagen concentrations in the yolk
   result in large measurement errors for yolk corticosterone, even when
   the cross-reactivity seems small. This was observed for both species. We
   further found species-specific differences in the actual corticosterone
   amounts present in the egg yolks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Understanding the many factors that underlie phenotypic variation is of
   profound importance to evolutionary biologists. The embryonic endocrine
   environment is one such factor that has received much attention. In
   placental amniotes, the dynamic interaction of maternal and embryonic
   steroid production and metabolism is critical to regulating the
   endocrine environment. Less is known about how embryos of oviparous
   amniotes regulate their endocrine environment because most studies have
   focused on relating initial steroid levels in the yolk at oviposition to
   offspring phenotype. We tested the hypothesis that embryos of oviparous
   amniotes regulate their endocrine environment by conjugating maternal
   steroids and subsequently using the metabolites as precursors for
   steroid production later in development. Using the red-eared slider
   turtle (Trachemys scripta), we first characterized the conjugation of
   exogenous oestradiol to either oestradiol glucuronide or oestradiol
   sulphate (E-2-S) in ovo during the first 15 days of development. Results
   show that oestradiol is primarily conjugated to E-2-S. We then examined
   whether E-2-S influenced sex determination and report that E-2-S
   increases the production of female offspring. These data demonstrate
   that oviparous amniotes can both sulphonate steroids and respond to
   sulphonated steroids during embryonic development in a manner similar to
   placental amniotes.}},

Abstract = {{Owl clutches typically hatch asynchronously, and brood size hierarchies
   develop. In this study, we describe intra-clutch variation of
   testosterone, androstenedione, estradiol, and corticosterone in Eastern
   screech owl egg yolks. In order to assess whether these hormones may
   have originated in the follicle, we also characterize variation of
   testosterone, androstenedione, and corticosterone within the exterior,
   intermediate, and interior regions of the yolk. Concentrations of
   testosterone and androstenedione were distributed relatively evenly
   across egg lay order with the exception of first-laid eggs that had
   significantly lower concentrations of both androgens than eggs later in
   the laying sequence. Corticosterone and estradiol did not vary with
   laying order. Our results suggest that when food is abundant, yolk
   hormones are deposited in patterns that minimize sibling differences
   except to reduce dominance by the first-hatching chick. Testosterone and
   androstenedione concentrations varied throughout the yolk, while
   corticosterone was evenly distributed throughout the yolk. This supports
   a follicular origin for both yolk androgens, and an adrenal origin for
   yolk corticosterone. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{In vertebrates maternal androgens can substantially influence developing
   offspring, inducing both short and long term changes in physiology and
   behavior, including androgen sensitive traits. However, how the effects
   of maternal hormones are mediated remains unknown. Two possible pathways
   are that maternal androgens affect parts of the
   hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG axis) or the sensitivity to
   androgens by affecting androgen receptor (AR) densities within the
   brain. To investigate both pathways, testosterone within the
   physiological range or vehicle only was injected into the egg yolk of
   unincubated chicken eggs and AR mRNA expression in different brain
   nuclei as well as plasma testosterone levels were measured in two week
   old male and female chicks that had hatched from these eggs. Our results
   showed a significant sex difference in plasma testosterone levels with
   males showing higher levels than females. Furthermore, AR mRNA
   expression as well as plasma testosterone levels were significantly
   lower in chicks hatched from testosterone treated eggs. These results
   suggest a compensatory mechanism for avoiding potential detrimental
   effects of high testosterone levels. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Parents are selected to preferentially invest in the offspring with
   highest reproductive value. One mechanism for achieving this is the
   modification of competitive asymmetries between siblings by maternal
   hormones. In many organisms, offspring value varies according to birth
   position in the brood, which determines survival chances and competitive
   advantage over access to resources. In birds, variation in yolk androgen
   allocation over the laying sequence is thought to modulate dominance of
   senior chicks over junior brood mates. We tested this hypothesis in
   zebra finches, which show a naturally decreasing pattern of
   within-clutch testosterone allocation. We abolished these within-clutch
   differences by experimentally elevating yolk testosterone levels in eggs
   2-6 to the level of egg 1, and we assessed fitness measures for junior
   offspring (eggs 2-6), senior offspring (egg 1), and their mothers.
   Testosterone-injected eggs hatched later than control eggs. Junior, but
   not senior, chicks in testosterone-treated broods attained poorer
   phenotypic quality compared to control broods, which was not compensated
   for by positive effects on seniors. Mothers were generally unaffected by
   clutch treatment. Thus, naturally decreasing within-clutch yolk
   testosterone allocation appears to benefit all family members and does
   not generally enhance brood reduction by favoring senior chicks, in
   contrast to the widely held assumption.}},

Abstract = {{Mother birds can enhance growth and/or survival of chicks by supplying
   energetic and hormonal resources to the egg yolk (i.e. maternal effect).
   In several bird species, mothers supply higher level of testosterone to
   the eggs laid later within the clutch and enhance the growth of the
   chick to compensate for the disadvantage of the later hatching. As same
   as this within-clutch mechanism, mothers breeding later in the season
   can be expected to supply higher level of testosterone to the clutch.
   However, among-clutch seasonal variation in yolk testosterone levels has
   been rarely described. Here, we investigated among-clutch seasonal
   variation in the yolk testosterone level in Black-tailed Gulls Larus
   crassirostris, as well as within-clutch variation. Mean yolk
   testosterone level of eggs laid later within the clutch ({''}b-eggs{''})
   was significantly higher than that of eggs laid earlier
   ({''}a-eggs{''}). The yolk testosterone levels of both a- and b-eggs of
   later breeders were significantly higher than those of earlier ones,
   while this trend was not observed in mean egg mass. Our results indicate
   that mothers establishing the clutch later in the season would invest
   more maternal testosterone into the clutch.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal stress effects on offspring development have been studied
   largely in rodents and primates, and to a lesser extent in farm animals.
   Potential lack of knowledge concerning prenatal stress on farm animals
   is regrettable because they are frequently subjected to a variety of
   husbandry stressors. Above all, effects of maternal stress on poultry
   offspring have been neglected. Prenatal effects in birds are known to
   involve maternal steroids present in eggs. In this study, we
   investigated the effects of daily unpredictable stressors applied to
   laying Japanese quail on their offspring's morphological and behavioural
   development. We also investigated the effects of our procedure on female
   reproductive output and on egg characteristics (weight, composition,
   yolk sex steroid levels). Our procedure induced only a mild stress:
   laying and egg fertilization rates of stressed females were not
   impaired; they remained similar to those of control females.
   Nonetheless, our stress procedure had an impact on some egg
   characteristics: stressed females' eggs were heavier, contained more
   albumen and tended to have higher yolk testosterone levels than control
   females' eggs. Stressed females' offspring hatched earlier, were heavier
   at hatching and had a different growth pattern than did control females'
   offspring. They also appeared to have a higher emotional reactivity than
   control chicks when encountering a novel environment and they reacted
   more strongly following social separation. Our study revealed that mild
   stressors applied to laying Japanese quail can increase the emotional
   reactivity of their chicks and suggested that maternal stress effects on
   offspring are mediated by changes in egg composition and yolk
   testosterone levels. We stress the particular relevance to the poultry
   industry of our findings highlighting the importance of taking into
   account the environment of laying females, as this environment can
   influence their progeny's behaviour and therefore their subsequent
   adaptation to husbandry conditions and ultimately their welfare. (C)

Abstract = {{Females can adaptively adjust phenotype of their offspring via
   deposition of various compounds into eggs, including androgens and other
   hormones. Here, I investigated how egg yolk androgens (testosterone and
   androstenedione) related to environmental conditions and parental traits
   in the great tit (Parus major) across three breeding seasons. Male and
   female traits studied included age, condition and multiple feather
   ornaments, both carotenoid- and melanin-based (carotenoid and UV chroma
   of yellow breast feathers, area of black breast band and white cheek
   immaculateness). Yolk mass increased with laying temperature, laying
   date and area of male black breast band. Concentration of androgens
   increased with breeding density, territory quality and carotenoid chroma
   of male yellow breast feathers and was higher in mates of 1 year old as
   compared to older males. Yolk androgens were not related to any of the
   female traits analysed. These patterns were thus consistent with (1)
   social and environmental effects on yolk mass and composition and (2)
   both positive and negative differential allocation strategies of
   resource allocation in females. Overall, male traits were the most
   important predictors of egg yolk characteristics in this socially

Abstract = {{Resting metabolic rate is a common way of quantifying the cost of living
   in endothermic animals. The trait often makes up a substantial part of
   an animal's energy budget and can also be related to sustainable peak
   work rate as well as to daily energy expenditure. Studies have shown
   that metabolic rates are often heritable, but much of the variation
   seems to be caused by other factors (e.g., environmental and maternal
   effects). In a previous study, in ovo exposure to increased levels of
   testosterone induced metabolic costs early in life. It is, however,
   unknown whether in ovo androgens also have long-term effects on
   individual metabolic rates. In this study, we show that experimentally
   increased levels of in ovo testosterone in zebra finches (Taeniopygia
   guttata) result in a 7\% higher resting metabolic rate when they are
   adults. This shows that maternally transferred hormones can induce
   long-term effects on metabolic demands and potentially influence
   variation in life-history strategies among offspring. Variation in
   maternal hormone transfer may also explain some of the large
   interindividual variation observed in metabolic rates.}},

Abstract = {{Early androgen exposure is known to have long-lasting effects on
   phenotype, behaviour and even fitness, but difficulties in measuring the
   exposure hinders the study of its importance in evolutionary context.
   Digit ratios have been highlighted as a potential easy-to-measure
   indicator of early steroid exposure, as they have been suggested to
   reflect steroid, mainly testosterone levels during prenatal development.
   However, evidence for digit ratios reflecting early steroid levels is
   weak, as experimental studies, especially in wild populations, are
   scarce. We studied the association between maternally derived yolk
   androgens and digit ratios (2D:4D, 2D:3D and 3D:4D) using both
   correlative data and a rather high level of experimental elevation of
   yolk androgens in a passerine bird, the pied flycatcher (Ficedula
   hypoleuca). We also examined whether digit ratios have indicator value
   in an evolutionary context by studying correlations between digit ratios
   and reproductive traits, secondary sexual traits and exploratory
   behaviour. We did not find any association between digit ratios and yolk
   androgen level either in correlative or experimental data. Digit ratios
   were neither related to any of the reproductive and secondary sexual
   traits or exploratory behaviour measured. There was, however, a sex
   difference in 2D:3D and 3D:4D of adult birds (due to second and fourth
   digits being shorter in females), which was not apparent in fledglings
   or captivity-raised juveniles. This suggests that either the sex
   difference may develop as late as during the sexual maturation for
   breeding. These results indicate that, in this species, digit ratios are
   not reliable markers of maternally derived yolk androgen exposure and
   that they bear little relevance as correlates of the adaptive traits we
   measured.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, there has been much interest in the role of endogenous and
   maternal hormones as regulators of offspring begging and mediators of
   parent-offspring conflict. Here, we review recent work in this field,
   and identify inconsistencies in the literature. We find good evidence
   that hormones play a role as regulators of begging: 13 studies report a
   positive effect on begging and six a negative effect. There is also good
   evidence that hormones influence offspring fitness, but the direction of
   reported effects is inconsistent: eight studies report a positive effect
   on offspring fitness and 10 a negative effect. We explore potential
   pathways linking hormonal effects on begging and growth. We find that
   our current understanding of these pathways is incomplete, and suggest a
   simple model linking hormonal effects on begging and growth. We next
   discuss the role of hormones as mediators of parent-offspring conflict.
   We find little evidence that maternal hormones provide a mechanism for
   parental favouritism. We use graphical models to explore the hypothesis
   that maternal hormones act as honest signals, and find that costs of
   hormone production can ensure the honesty of maternal hormones but only
   under very restricted conditions. We discuss evidence from recent
   cross-fostering experiments suggesting that maternal hormones act in the
   context of overlapping interests between parents and offspring. Finally,
   we highlight the need for more studies on nonavian taxa to establish
   whether hormonal regulation of begging is specific to birds or general
   across taxa where offspring beg for food from their parents. (C) 2010

Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{FEB 23}},
Abstract = {{Conditions experienced during early life can influence the development
   of an organism and several physiological traits, even in adulthood. An
   important factor is the level of oxidative stress experienced during
   early life. In birds, extra-genomic egg substances, such as the
   testosterone hormone, may exert a widespread influence over the
   offspring phenotype. Interestingly, testosterone can also upregulate the
   bioavailability of certain antioxidants but simultaneously increases the
   susceptibility to oxidative stress in adulthood. However, little is
   known about the effects of maternally derived yolk testosterone on
   oxidative stress in developing birds. Here, we investigated the role of
   yolk testosterone on oxidative stress of yellow-legged gull chicks
   during their early development by experimentally increasing yolk
   testosterone levels. Levels of antioxidants, reactive oxygen species and
   lipid oxidative damage were determined in plasma during nestlings'
   growth. Our results revealed that, contrary to control chicks, birds
   hatched from testosterone-treated eggs did not show an increase in the
   levels of oxidative damage during postnatal development. Moreover, the
   same birds showed a transient increase in plasma antioxidant levels. Our
   results suggest that yolk testosterone may shape the oxidative
   stress-resistance phenotype of the chicks during early development owing
   to an increase in antioxidant defences and repair processes.}},

Abstract = {{Female birds might be able to manipulate the parental effort of their
   male partner through elevated transfer of hormones to the eggs, since
   these hormones affect many chick traits that males might use as cues for
   adjusting the level of their investment. We experimentally studied
   whether female pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca could manipulate male
   investment via yolk androgens. There is much more variation in yolk
   androgen levels between females than within clutches, and in order to
   change the androgen levels of the eggs, we swapped whole clutches
   between nests. To estimate the androgen levels of the clutch, we
   measured the androgen content of a single egg per clutch. Females did
   not succeed in manipulating male effort using yolk androgens, since
   there was no relationship between the division of parental care within a
   pair and either original or foster egg androgen levels. One of these
   relationships should have occurred if females were manipulating males.
   The proportion of feeding visits by the male was higher when the male
   was old (55\%) than when he was young (45\%) and females laid eggs with
   higher androgen levels when mated with a young male. Young males did not
   exhibit any responses to yolk androgen levels either, which indicates
   that females cannot exploit their effort more than that of old males. We
   suggest that females may allocate yolk androgens to adjust the growth
   trajectories of the chicks to poor growing conditions when mated with
   young males that are poor providers or occupying a poor territory.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal effects are important in epigenetic determination of offspring
   phenotypes during all life stages. In the chicken (Gallus gallus
   domesticus), transgenerational transfer of egg yolk factors may set the
   stage for morphological and physiological phenotypic differences
   observed among breeds. To investigate the effect of breed-specific yolk
   composition on embryonic broiler and layer chicken phenotypes, we
   employed an ex ovo, xenobiotic technique that allowed the transfer of
   broiler and layer chicken embryos from their natural yolks to novel yolk
   environments. Embryonic day two broiler embryos developing on broiler
   yolk culture medium (YCM) had significantly higher heart rates than
   layer embryos developing on layer YCM (176 +/- 7 beats min(-1) and 147
   +/- 7. beats min(-1), respectively). Broiler embryos developing on layer
   YCM exhibited heart rates typical of layer embryos developing normally
   on layer YCM. However, layer embryo heart rates were not affected by
   development on broiler YCM. Unlike O-2 consumption, development rate and
   body mass of embryos were significantly affected by exposure to
   different yolk types, with both broiler and layer embryos displaying
   traits that reflected yolk source rather than embryo genotype. Analysis
   of hormone concentrations of broiler and layer egg yolks revealed that
   testosterone concentrations were higher in broiler yolk (4.63 +/- 2.02
   pg mg(-1) vs 3.32 +/- 1.92 pg mg(-1)), whereas triiodothyronine
   concentrations were higher in layer yolk (1.05 +/- 0.18 pg mg(-1) vs
   0.46 +/- 0.22 pg mg(-1)). Thus, a complex synergistic effect of
   breed-specific genotype and yolk environment exists early in chicken
   development, with yolk thyroid hormone and yolk testosterone as
   potential mediators of the physiological and morphological effects.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in exposure to sex hormones during early development
   contributes to phenotypic plasticity in vertebrate offspring. As a
   proposed marker for prenatal sex hormone exposure and because of their
   association with various physiological and behavioral characteristics,
   digit ratio and/or digit length have received notable interest within
   the field of evolutionary ecology. However, the validity of digit
   measures as a proxy of prenatal sex hormone exposure is controversial
   and only few studies have provided direct evidence for the link between
   digit development and prenatal sex hormones. Here, we report morph- and
   sex-specific variation in digit ratio in wild painted dragon lizards
   (Ctenophorus pictus). Lizards expressing a yellow bib have significantly
   larger third-to-fourth toe ratios (3D:4D) than lizards without a bib.
   Males have significantly smaller 3D:4D than females. Furthermore, we
   show that experimental elevation of yolk testosterone significantly
   increases 3D:4D in hatchling painted dragon lizards, but has no
   influence on hatchling size. Our results provide direct and indirect
   evidence for the involvement of prenatal sex steroids in digit
   development and it is suggested that digit ratio may be used as a
   biomarker for prenatal steroid exposure in this reptilian species. As
   such, digit ratio may provide a useful tool to study temporal or spatial
   differences in the proximate hormonal mechanisms modulating
   physiological and behavioural phenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{Yolk androgen deposition is a widely investigated maternal effect in
   birds, but its adaptive value is at present unclear. The offspring
   fitness correlates of natural yolk androgen levels are virtually
   unknown, whereas manipulations largely focused on testosterone and
   neglected other androgens. We determined yolk concentrations of the 2
   dominant androgens, androstenedione and testosterone, from all eggs in
   collared flycatcher clutches and followed the fate of individual
   offspring from these eggs in a crossfostering experiment. Yolk
   concentration of androstenedione was much higher than that of
   testosterone. Offspring from eggs with relatively higher androstenedione
   concentrations within a clutch were relatively large after hatching,
   grew slower thereafter, and had a higher recruitment rate in subsequent
   years. The increase of androstenedione with laying order and its
   within-clutch variance were negatively correlated with a
   condition-dependent female ornament, perhaps indicating compensatory
   hormone deposition into later hatching eggs by females in low condition.
   Yolk testosterone variation within or among clutches was not related to
   any measured aspect of offspring or parental quality. Our results
   suggest that in some species, especially those with much more
   androstenedione than testosterone in the yolk, androstenedione and not
   testosterone may be the yolk androgen with a long-term function and
   adaptive deposition pattern.}},

Abstract = {{The manipulating androgens hypothesis (MAH) proposes that female birds
   increase the level of testosterone (T) in their eggs to promote greater
   offspring begging, and thereby elicit increased provisioning by their
   mates. We examined the effect of a positive in ovo manipulation of T on
   provisioning by house wren, Troglodytes aedon, parents, and
   concomitantly examined the begging response of nestlings. We also
   examined the mass of nestlings throughout their growth to assess the
   effect of T on their development, and three measures of nest
   performance: hatching success, nestling survival and the proportion of
   nestlings that fledged. Nestlings hatching from T-injected eggs begged
   more than nestlings hatching from control (oil-injected) eggs early in
   the nestling period, but not later in the nestling period. However,
   treatment had no effect on the levels of parental provisioning or
   nestling mass gain, nor any effect on hatching success or nestling
   survival. There was a significant increase in parental provisioning
   rate, but a decline in the size of prey taken to the nest over the
   course of the breeding season, which was likely the result of declining
   environmental quality. Our results support neither the MAH, nor the
   expectation that nestlings should grow at different rates in relation to
   in ovo titres of T. (c) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Evidence is accumulating that sex steroids in the eggs, besides
   affecting progeny phenotype and behavior in the short term, also have
   enduring effects until adulthood, when they may translate into
   differences in reproductive strategies and success. Maternal steroids
   transfer may therefore affect both agonistic behavior and mate choice
   decisions, either through the promotion of body size and condition or
   through a priming effect on the neuroendocrine system. However, owing to
   the prevalence of a short-term perspective, relevance of maternal
   transfer of sex steroids to sexual selection processes has been seldom
   studied. Here we investigate the effects of an experimental increase in
   egg testosterone on male dominance and copulation success in the
   ring-necked pheasant, Phasianus colchicus, a polygynous galliform with
   multiple male ornamental traits, in captivity. We found that females
   from testosterone (T) injected eggs copulated less than control females.
   Males from T-injected eggs obtained more copulations than control males,
   specifically with control females. The effect of male `ordinary' and
   secondary sexual traits on either dominance or copulation frequency did
   not depend on early exposure to T, nor did T treatment affect male
   dominance. Present results demonstrate that variation in the early
   hormonal environment set up by mothers affects sexual behavior of the
   offspring, which might translate into fitness differences. (C) 2010

Booktitle = {{HORMONES AND REPRODUCTION OF VERTEBRATES, VOL 4: BIRDS}},

Pages = {{91-127}},
Abstract = {{Avian eggs contain substantial levels of maternal hormones. Their levels
   vary in relation to a range of factors such as laying order, food
   availability, breeding density, and male quality. Yolk hormones
   subsequently influence offspring growth, behavior, physiology, immune
   system, and ultimately survival and reproduction. Some studies support
   the idea that maternal hormones may signal and prepare offspring for
   prevailing conditions. Adaptive effects require flexible mechanisms of
   hormone deposition and response. Separate control over hormone levels in
   circulation and yolk allows independent effects on offspring and
   mothers, while regulation of the response to maternal hormones allows
   offspring to fine-tune the effects on different traits. There is good
   evidence for such flexibility in both deposition and response. Natural
   selection on hormone-mediated maternal effects may differ between
   mothers and offspring, because costs and benefits are not equally
   shared. Evolutionary changes in the deposition and effect of these
   hormones therefore depend upon the consequences for all family members.
   Gaps in our understanding of the adaptive benefits and their underlying
   physiological mechanisms offer opportunities for future research.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal decline in egg size and yolk androgen concentration in a double
   brooded passerine.
   The aim of our study is to test whether maternal investment in eggs
   (clutch size, egg volume and yolk androgen concentration) varies between
   early and late clutches in the spotless starling Sturnus unicolor and
   whether these differences may be related to nestling reproductive value
   in terms of ectoparasite load. The study was performed in Soto del Real,
   Madrid, in central Spain (40 degrees 44' N, 3 degrees 48' W) from March
   to July 2007. Before the onset of laying in the population females were
   trapped and marked when visiting nest-boxes. Captures were discontinued
   when laying approached and observations were performed to assess the
   identity of females breeding at each nest-box. Nests were monitored from
   egg laying to fledgling. In order to measure yolk androgens, the first
   egg laid was collected in all clutches before incubation started. Yolk
   concentrations of testosterone (T) and androstenedione (A4) were
   measured by EIA kits highly specific for each hormone. Nestling
   reproductive value was estimated in relation to nest ectoparasite load
   by the fly Carnus hemapterus. We found that females in early clutches
   laid larger eggs with higher androgen concentration than females in late
   clutches. Nestling reproductive value was also influenced by timing of
   reproduction: early clutches presented a lower ectoparasite load than
   late clutches. Finally, female investment in eggs was not related to
   nest ectoparasite load neither in early nor late clutches. With our
   results we conclude that spotless starling females invest more resources
   in early than in late clutches. However, future studies manipulating
   female condition, environmental variables and nestling reproductive
   value should be performed in order to test whether this seasonal decline
   in egg size and yolk androgens may have evolved as an adaptive female
   adjustment strategy.}},

Abstract = {{It has been proposed that female birds can influence the phenotype of
   their offspring by provisioning eggs with variable amounts of nutrients
   and maternal hormones. Egg quality is strongly influenced by maternal
   body reserves and the amount of food available at the time of egg
   formation. This study investigated the effects of maternal state and
   food availability on the capacity of female lesser black-backed gulls
   Larus fuscus to provision their eggs with macronutrients and steroid
   hormones. Maternal state was reduced by increasing egg-production
   effort, whereas extra food was provided to reverse this effect. Compared
   with eggs of first clutches, eggs of experimentally induced replacement
   clutches exhibited a lower yolk/albumen ratio and contained more yolk
   testosterone. During one of the three years in which the study was
   performed, replacement eggs also contained more 17 beta-estradiol. Food
   provisioning during the relaying interval did not affect changes in
   yolk/albumen ratio or steroid concentrations, but fed females produced
   bigger eggs in their replacement clutch. This study demonstrates
   significant within-female consistency in egg size, macronutrient
   content, and yolk steroid concentration, and it shows that these egg
   characteristics are influenced by maternal state, food availability, and
   the timing of breeding.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, a number of studies have shown that female birds are able to
   control the sex of their progeny at the stage of the gamete. There is
   also some evidence that females adjust their investment in offspring
   depending on the sex of the embryo during egg formation. Differential
   maternal investment to the eggs depending on their sex is usually
   interpreted as an adaptive strategy, by which females can increase
   competitive abilities of the smaller sex, or preferentially invest
   towards the sex with the potentially higher fitness returns. Here, we
   studied variation in egg size in relation to embryo sex and laying order
   in the European Blackbird Turdus merula. We found male and female eggs
   to differ in size, with larger eggs containing male embryos, as well as
   a significant interaction between embryo sex and laying order. This
   interaction resulted from the fact that egg size increased with the
   laying sequence among eggs bearing females but did not change with
   laying order among eggs bearing males. There was no relationship between
   offspring sex and the laying sequence within a clutch. We suggest that
   sexual dimorphism in egg size recorded in the European Blackbird may
   reflect favouritism of the sex which may give higher fitness returns.}},

Abstract = {{When a female bird begins incubation before clutch completion, the
   nestlings hatch sequentially, and a size hierarchy forms within the
   brood. This size hierarchy may be minimized or exacerbated through
   differential allocation of resources to eggs across the laying order. In
   this study, we characterize intra-clutch variation in cockatiel clutches
   by measuring egg mass, yolk mass, and concentrations of yolk
   testosterone, androstenedione, and corticosterone. Cockatiels are a
   long-lived member of the Psittaciformes. Because asynchronous hatching
   may reduce sibling competition and allow for extended development
   periods in long-lived birds, we predicted that female cockatiels would
   allocate maternal resources in a way that would reinforce the brood size
   hierarchy. Significant within-clutch differences in egg size and steroid
   concentrations were observed. Eggs at the end of the laying sequence
   were smaller and had significantly smaller yolks than eggs early in the
   laying order. Fifth-laid eggs, as well as first-laid eggs, contained
   significantly lower concentrations of testosterone than eggs in other
   positions of the laying sequence. No differences in yolk androstenedione
   concentration were observed. Yolk corticosterone concentrations
   increased linearly with laying order. Together, these patterns might
   reinforce the brood size hierarchy created by asynchronous hatching. (C)

Pages = {{3127-3130}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Conspicuous traits produced by melanin deposition in integuments are
   often involved in visual communication. The information content of
   melanin-based signals is unclear as their expression is tightly
   controlled by genes and, apparently, is less dependent on individual
   condition. In birds, high heritabilities have been attributed to
   melanin-based plumages, often on the basis of egg-swapping manipulations
   (cross-fostering experiments). However, it is well known that female
   birds can differentially transfer testosterone to the egg yolk.
   Furthermore, high testosterone levels have been related to high
   oxidative stress. As we recently found that oxidative stress experienced
   during development influences the expression of melanin-based traits,
   here we manipulated the level of yolk testosterone in great tits (Parus
   major) to assess the influence of this maternal effect on the expression
   of the black breast stripe, a well-known melanin-based signal. We
   predicted that fledglings hatched from eggs with high testosterone
   levels will not only show larger black stripes but also experience
   changes in their antioxidant machinery. Indeed, the size of the black
   stripe of great tits hatched from testosterone-injected eggs was almost
   double that of controls. Furthermore, the same individuals showed a
   trend to higher levels of circulating antioxidants, which suggests an
   adaptive response against some testosterone-induced oxidative challenge.}},

Abstract = {{In precocial bird species, the eggs constitute most of the maternal
   investment because parents do not feed the young after they hatch.
   Maternal testosterone in egg yolk influences the embryo's and chick's
   development. Females deposit testosterone in the eggs as a response to
   the environment experienced during the laying period, including the
   quality of their mate. To assess the relevance of the female's mate
   selection on egg characteristics in the grey partridge, Perdix perdix,
   we tested breeding females in a choice trial where they were allowed to
   choose between two males. After the choice trials, females were mated
   either with their preferred male (P group) or with the nonpreferred one
   (NP group). Although eggs laid by females of the two groups did not
   differ significantly in mass, females of the P group laid eggs with a
   higher yolk testosterone concentration than females of the NP group.

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{Evidence is mounting that female animals use egg-yolk compounds (e.g.
   steroids, antioxidants) to adaptively engineer the quality of their
   offspring as a function of several maternal and environmental factors.
   Though adjustments to yolk allocation have been well-characterized as a
   function of parental phenotypes, we know very little about how an
   individual's social environment influences yolk composition. Here, we
   consider how two types of yolk compounds, androgens and carotenoids,
   relate to the maternal social environment during the egg-laying period,
   controlling statistically for known correlations between various aspects
   of parental quality and egg yolk compounds. Barn swallows Hirundo
   rustica erythrogaster breed in groups of highly variable size and
   spacing, allowing us to test whether or not the social environment is
   correlated with these maternal effects. We found no relationship between
   carotenoid levels in eggs as a function of colony size, colony density,
   or nearest-neighbor distance. However, eggs from females in larger
   groups had lower concentrations and total amounts of yolk androgens than
   those from females in smaller, less dense social settings. Our results
   counter previous predictions and literature, showing that females
   breeding in large groups deposit more androgen in eggs, mechanistically,
   because they compete more with conspecifics and have higher circulating
   androgen levels themselves and, functionally, because it could be
   advantageous for their offspring to show high androgen-mediated
   competitive abilities early in life. Instead, because group size in this
   species is governed largely by site fidelity and the availability of old
   nests for re-use, and because reproductive output does not differ as a
   function of group size, it may be that competition is greater for
   limited nests in small groups, thus elevating androgen levels. Further,
   yolk androgens were previously shown to be affected by male quality, and
   the greater concentrations and amounts of yolk androgens in smaller
   sites may reflect differential allocation to darker males found at these
   sites.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal stress in birds can have permanent transgenerational effects
   through the transmission of stress hormones to offspring via the egg
   yolk. Previous studies have shown that White Leghorn hens show a
   heightened response to stress compared with Hy-Line Brown hens,
   producing significantly more corticosterone and displaying longer bouts
   of tonic immobility after handling, whereas baseline levels of
   corticosterone are similar between the strains. We tested the hypothesis
   that higher stress responsiveness would correspond to chronic
   accumulation and thus higher concentrations of corticosterone in egg
   yolks after exposure to stressors associated with routine maintenance.
   Eggs were collected from white and brown hens that were undisturbed
   except for daily feeding and routine egg collections. Corticosterone was
   quantified in plasma, egg yolks, and albumen and compared between
   strains. We predicted that corticosterone concentrations in yolk would
   be higher in eggs from white versus brown hens but that albumen
   corticosterone would not differ between strains due to the short term of
   albumen deposition. As predicted, yolk corticosterone concentrations
   were significantly higher in eggs produced by white hens, approximately
   twice those found in eggs laid by brown hens. Plasma and albumen
   concentrations of corticosterone were similar between groups. These
   results suggest that offspring hatching from eggs laid by White Leghorn
   hens are exposed to significantly more corticosterone through
   concentration in the egg yolk, which could permanently imprint offspring
   physiology and behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The differential allocation hypothesis assumes that animals should weigh
   costs and benefits of investing into reproduction with a current mate
   against the expected quality of future mates, and predicts that they
   should invest more into reproduction when pairing with a high-quality
   mate. In the broad-nosed pipefish (Syngnathus typhle), males care for
   the embryos in a brood pouch and females compete for access to male
   mating partners. Both sexes prefer mating with large partners. In the
   present study, we show that the same female provides both large and
   small mating partners with eggs of similar size, weight and lipid
   content when mated to two males in succession. Importantly, however,
   eggs provided to small males (less preferred) had higher egg protein
   content (11\% more) than those provided to large males (preferred).
   Thus, contrary to the differential allocation hypothesis, eggs did not
   contain more resources when females mated with a larger male. Instead,
   the pattern observed in our results is consistent with a compensatory
   reproductive strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal yolk androgens in avian eggs have been shown to affect numerous
   offspring traits. These changes in offspring phenotype represent
   examples of maternal effects and are thought to adjust offspring
   development to the posthatching environment. When studying the
   functional consequences of yolk hormones it is, therefore, crucial to
   manipulate the yolk androgen concentrations as well as the environmental
   conditions under which the study is performed. However, so far
   context-dependent effects of maternal yolk hormones have not
   sufficiently been taken into account, which might contribute to the
   current level of inconsistency in yolk androgen-mediated effects. We
   experimentally elevated the yolk testosterone concentrations and
   manipulated the sibling size hierarchy. We focused on the effects of
   yolk testosterone on growth and monitored begging behavior and parental
   feeding preferences in search of the underlying mechanisms of changes in
   growth. Experimental changes in the yolk testosterone concentrations
   significantly affected offspring phenotype. However, elevated yolk
   testosterone concentrations only improved the growth of chicks that were
   at a competitive disadvantage, whereas it benefited all chicks when
   placed in staged competition for food as juvenile. This emphasizes the
   compensatory role of yolk androgens in the context of hatching
   asynchrony and its context dependency. Enhanced growth did not coincide
   with intensified begging. Neither males nor females preferentially fed
   chicks hatching from eggs with elevated yolk testosterone
   concentrations. Enhanced growth rather resulted from yolk testosterone
   induced changes in physiology, of which the detailed mechanisms are yet
   unknown.}},

Abstract = {{Avian eggs contain variable levels of several maternal androgens that
   may all be important in adjusting offspring phenotype at the individual
   or brood level. Most studies have focused on experimental manipulations
   of testosterone (T), and the other yolk androgens such as
   androstenedione (A(4)) and 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) were so far
   neglected. However, in species where the amount of A(4) in the yolk much
   exceeds that of the other androgens, A(4) could represent the dominant
   agent of androgen-mediated maternal effects, in which case manipulations
   of T would be misdirected. We conducted our study in a species with high
   yolk A(4) and relatively low T and DHT levels, the Japanese quail
   Coturnix japonica. We injected unincubated eggs with a physiological
   dose of either A(4), T, or DHT, and measured hatchling growth, as well
   as behaviour in an open field test. T treatment non-significantly
   increased social reinstatement behaviour in the open field test, but it
   seemed to significantly suppress early skeletal growth and mass gain.
   The A(4) and DHT treatments, in contrast, significantly increased
   reinstatement behaviour, but did not affect mass and size growth. These
   results suggest that future investigations should view yolk androgens as
   integrated components of the complex yolk steroid environment.}},

Abstract = {{The phenomenon of primary offspring sex ratio adjustment is being
   extensively studied, yet knowledge of the underlying proximate mechanism
   is still mainly hypothetical. Female birds are the heterogametic sex,
   thus potentially controlling the sex of the gamete to be fertilized. In
   several bird species, independent studies showed effects of maternal
   plasma testosterone, corticosterone, or condition on primary offspring
   sex ratio. Our objective was to investigate the causal relation between
   these two maternal hormones, body condition, and offspring sex ratio in
   homing pigeons (Columba livia domestica). Following our earlier study,
   we again implanted females with testosterone and determined embryo sex
   of first eggs. To identify the pathway of sex ratio adjustment, we
   repeatedly measured not only maternal plasma testosterone and mass but
   also plasma corticosterone, cholesterol, and glucose, all indicators of
   body condition. We also calculated the temporal change in these
   parameters, which has been proposed to be a more accurate predictor of
   offspring sex ratio compared with the absolute values. Furthermore, we
   analyzed testosterone concentrations in outer yolk layers, which
   potentially influence the first meiotic division of the gamete. We found
   no relation between plasma parameter and embryo sex of first eggs;
   testosterone treatment did not affect any of the measured parameters.
   However, females that increased in mass produced more male embryos,
   irrespective of treatment group. Outer yolk layer testosterone
   concentrations did not differ between treatment groups or between male
   and female eggs. We propose that not only the absolute values but also
   the complex interactions between maternal hormones and body condition
   ultimately affect the mechanism of primary offspring sex manipulation.}},

Abstract = {{Hormone-mediated maternal effects play an important role in the
   formation of a differentiated phenotype. They have been shown to
   influence a wide array of offspring traits, both early in life and in
   adulthood. One important offspring trait that is under the influence of
   maternal androgens is the immune system. In birds, a growing number of
   studies show that yolk androgens modulate immune function during the
   chick stage. However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding long-term
   effects of prenatal androgens on offspring immunity. In this study, we
   therefore investigated the influence of prenatal testosterone (T) on
   several measures of immunity in fledgling and adult zebra finches
   (Taeniopygia guttata). Cell-mediated immune response (towards
   phytohaemagglutinin, PHA) of fledglings hatching from control eggs was
   negatively related to brood size, whereas there was no such association
   for fledglings hatching from eggs with experimentally elevated T levels
   (T fledglings). Male control fledglings showed reduced mass gain
   compared to female control fledglings within 24 h after the PHA
   injection. This pattern was reversed in T fledglings. Total antibody
   levels in fledglings were not affected by egg treatment. Neither
   cell-mediated immunity nor total antibody levels in sexually mature
   zebra finches were influenced by egg treatment. However, there was an
   immuno-enhancing effect of elevated egg T on both primary and secondary
   humoral immune responses toward diphtheria and tetanus antigens in ca 5
   and 7 month old zebra finches. In addition, the covariation between
   different immune components differed between T and control offspring,
   suggesting that egg treatment may have altered the potential trade-offs
   between different parts of the immune system. Our results suggest that
   prenatal androgens could be an important factor contributing to
   individual variation in immune function even in adulthood.}},

Abstract = {{The hormonal environment during early development, such as maternally
   derived androgens in bird eggs, shapes the development and phenotype of
   the offspring in ways that may have important long-term consequences for
   behaviour. We studied the effects of yolk androgens m multiple
   behavioural traits in female and male pied flycatchers (Ficedula
   hypoleuca) by experimentally elevating androgen levels (testosterone and
   androstenedione) in the eggs. The birds were housed in; common-garden
   environment in captivity until full independence, after which their
   behaviour was tested. We found that androgen-treated males were more
   likely than control males to explore a novel environment and showed
   higher activity in the presence of a novel object. In response to a
   simulated predator attack androgen-treated males mainly showed freezing
   behaviour, while control males showed escape behaviour. Females from the
   androgen treatment and control group showed no differences in these
   behaviours. Androgen treatment did not affect neophobia (latency to
   approach the novel object) or dominance behaviour in either sex.
   Behaviour in the novel environment and towards a novel object was
   repeatable, but behaviours in the different experiments were mostly not
   inter-correlated. These results indicate that yolk androgens have
   various long-lasting effects on behaviour, especially in males, but that
   they do not induce a distinct behavioural syndrome. As behaviour is
   strongly linked with fitness, our results suggest that yolk androgens
   may play a role in determining fitness, and thus play a potentially
   adaptive role. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Birds are a particularly good group with which to examine the importance
   of maternal effects, as parental contributions can be relatively easily
   quantified compared with other groups. There have undoubtedly been more
   studies on maternal effects in the Zebra Finch than any other single
   bird species. Studies of this species have examined the importance of
   maternal effects mediated through sex allocation, size, nutrients and
   hormones of of eggs, incubation behaviour and provisioning levels. A
   synthesis of all of this work illustrates some contrasting results (e.g.
   many high-profile results have failed to be replicated), some very
   common patterns (e.g. investment shifts through the laying sequence),
   and potentially interesting and complex interactions between traits
   (e.g. between sex of offspring and hormonal profiles of eggs). This
   extensive collection of work on the Zebra Finch provides useful general
   insight into the patterns of maternal investment in birds and the
   effects on offspring phenotype. However, wecaution that the literature
   is probably littered with studies that have overemphasised the
   importance of some maternal effects and recent studies have highlighted
   analytical and logical flaws that have probably led to misplaced
   confidence in some of the findings reported to date. Finally, it is
   worth considering that the bulk of the literature is based on studies of
   captive domesticated birds and ecological and physiological data from
   individuals in the wild is currently lacking. The biological relevance
   of maternal effects documented in this model species is therefore
   unclear.}},

Abstract = {{In birds, early exposure to androgens has been shown to influence
   offspring growth and begging behaviour, and has been proposed as a
   mechanism for the development of sexual size dimorphism (SSD). Sex
   specific effects during development can occur due to sex-specific
   allocation of maternal androgens, sensitivity to, or synthesis of,
   androgens. In addition, maternal hormones have been suggested as a
   mechanism to skew brood sex ratio. This study uses one of the world's
   most extreme SSD species, the brown songlark Cinclorhamphus cruralis, to
   investigate (1) sex-specific differences of androgens in yolk and chick
   plasma and (2) the relationship between androgens and sex ratio bias.
   The study reveals no indication of sex-specific maternal allocation, but
   a modest sex effect during the later stages of incubation when the
   embryo starts to produce its own androgens. Moreover, there was a strong
   seasonal sex ratio bias: female-biased early and male-biased later in
   the season, but yolk testosterone (T) did not show a seasonal trend.
   Taken together these results suggest that if androgens, from any source,
   have a significant role in development of SSD in this species it is most
   likely via sex-specific sensitivity or synthesis rather than
   differential maternal transfer to the egg. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All

   sexed the hatchlings obtained from all nests to confirm for the first
   time the occurrence of temperature-dependent sex determination In this
   species and quantify sex ratios and the pivotal temperature for this
   population. In both nesting seasons, the majority of the nests In the
   field produced hatchlings of both sexes, but sex ratios differed between
   study beaches/years. The pivotal temperature documented (33.4 degrees C)
   appears to be among the highest reported for a turtle species.
   Incubation conditions In the naturally Incubated nests also Influenced
   hatching success rates and incubation periods, but not hatchling size or
   weight. Hatchlings obtained from the nests Incubated In the laboratory
   were reared for one month In order to study the influence of
   pre-hatching factors on growth rates. In these nests we documented
   maternal effects on egg size, Initial hatchling size, and weight and

Abstract = {{Deposition of yolk androgens can vary among females as well as within
   eggs of one female. Numerous external and internal factors can
   contribute to this variability. In our study, we investigated the
   systemic variation of yolk testosterone concentrations during the laying
   cycle of Japanese quail. reared in stable environmental and social
   conditions. Testosterone was analysed in three eggs collected per female
   at the beginning, top and the end of a reproductive period and the
   extent of inter- and intra-female differences in yolk deposition of this
   androgen was quantified. Yolk testosterone concentrations and the yolk
   testosterone content decreased from the early to the latest stage of
   reproductive period. Testosterone concentrations in the egg yolk as well
   as the age-dependent pattern significantly differed among individual
   females. We found high repeatability of yolk testosterone among 3 eggs
   of individual females together with high repeatability between 3 stages
   of the reproductive cycle. Testosterone in the egg yolk correlated
   positively with eggshell weight. Our results suggest that precocial
   birds with long laying sequences display higher inter-female differences
   in yolk testosterone concentrations compared with intra-individual
   variability. The decreased testosterone deposition with age may
   influence the development and behaviour of the young hatched at
   different stages of the female's reproductive cycle. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Maternal effects are environmental components of phenotypes that
   complicate relationships between natural selection and evolution because
   they often affect phenotypes and fitness simultaneously. We studied the
   effects of egg size variation on juvenile survival in a population of
   American coots (Fulica americana). We experimentally evaluated egg size
   variation at three levels: across the population, within natal nests,
   and within foster nests. Natal nests accounted for the most variation in
   population egg size. Within clutches, early-laid eggs were larger than
   later-laid eggs, with the exception of first-laid eggs, which were
   small. In the fostering experiment, posthatching survival was most
   strongly related to egg size relative to natal siblings and natal
   hatching order and less so to egg size within foster nests. These
   effects on survival were found even though young from natal nests were
   neither raised together nor raised by genetic parents. These results
   indicate that females allocate resources unequally among offspring such
   that offspring from larger, early-laid eggs have higher survival than
   offspring from smaller, later-laid eggs, regardless of their size
   relative to foster siblings or to mean population egg size. These
   results suggest that egg size variation can be maintained through
   selection on maternal investment strategies and not on egg size per se.}},

Abstract = {{Although it is well documented that testosterone (T) is an important
   mediator in the regulation of behaviour in male vertebrates, its
   functional significance in females is less understood. Experimentally
   increased T in adult female birds has been found to have both
   advantageous and detrimental effects on behaviour and fitness. In
   addition, T may also mediate maternal effects when it is deposited into
   the egg yolk, and variations in androgen concentration between eggs
   contribute to differences in offspring phenotype and fitness. In this
   study we examined the effects of experimentally elevated female T on
   reproductive success and yolk androgen deposition in the spotless
   starling. The administration of exogenous T in female spotless starlings
   before egg laying caused negative effects on reproductive performance:
   when compared to control females T-females laid fewer eggs and raised
   fewer chicks. We also found an effect of elevated female T on yolk
   androgen deposition: T-females laid eggs with greater amounts of yolk T
   than control females. whereas yolk androstenedione levels were not
   affected. Although some of these effects likely involved a direct
   interference of female T with female reproductive function, some of them
   could be due to effects operating in eggs through maladaptive high T
   levels. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Asynchronous hatching of eggs in avian clutches produces a size
   hierarchy among nestlings that may lead to variation within broods in
   resistance to pathogens or parasites. In this study, we tested several
   predictions regarding variation in immunocompetence and distribution of
   parasites within avian broods by combining parasite removal and
   carotenoid supplementation treatments in nests of mountain bluebirds
   Sialia currucoides. Last-hatched nestlings were less likely to invest
   carotenoids in an induced cell-mediated immune response, suggesting they
   may be more susceptible to parasites; however, parasite removal
   disproportionately benefited middle-ranked nestlings. This supports the
   hypothesis that some avian ectoparasites balance host resistance against
   nutritional benefits by preferentially parasitizing nestlings of
   intermediate quality and immunocompetence. We found no evidence that
   males positioned last in the hatching sequence were differentially
   affected by ectoparasites, and, contrary to some previous studies in
   other passerines, last-hatched nestlings in asynchronously hatching
   broods were not less immunocompetent than their nest mates. In fact,
   junior nestlings exhibited weaker immune responses than their siblings
   in more synchronously hatching broods, and we suggest this may reflect
   environment-dependent maternal effects that warrant further
   investigation. Overall, our results highlight the importance of
   understanding the feeding and host selection behaviour of ectoparasites,
   as well as the fitness consequences thereof, since many predictions
   related to within-brood distribution of parasites require that parasites
   are able to discern the relative quality of available hosts.}},

Abstract = {{Avian eggs contain substantial amounts of maternal androgens. The
   concentrations of these yolk androgens are affected by the maternal
   environment, such as the level of social competition, parasite exposure
   or food conditions. Since yolk androgens have been shown to affect a
   wide array of offspring traits, they may adjust the chicks to the
   expected post-hatching environment, but experimental evidence is still
   scarce. We investigate in colonial breeding black-headed gulls whether
   high concentrations of yolk androgens, such as those found in
   environments with high numbers of social interactions, facilitate
   aggressiveness and territorial behaviour of the chicks. Black-headed
   gulls are highly suitable for this, as the semi-precocial chicks defend
   the natal territory and food against intruders. We manipulated yolk
   androgen concentrations and investigated their role in both within-nest
   and between-nest aggression. We found that chicks hatching from
   androgen-treated eggs defended the natal territory more often than their
   nest mates from control eggs, without increasing sibling aggression.
   This suggests that variation in yolk androgen concentrations in relation
   to the social environment of the mother may indeed allow adjustment of
   the offspring's behaviour to the expected frequency of territorial
   interactions with conspecifics post-hatching.}},

Abstract = {{Differential reproductive investment by the mother can critically
   influence offspring development and phenotype, and strong selection is
   therefore expected to act on such maternal effects. Although a genetic
   basis is a prerequisite for phenotypic traits to respond to selection
   and thus to evolve, we still know very little about the extent of
   heritable variation in maternal effects in natural populations. Here, we
   present the first estimates of intrafemale repeatability across breeding
   seasons and estimates of heritability of hormone-mediated maternal
   effects in a wild population of collared flycatchers (Ficedula
   albicollis). We found that maternal yolk testosterone (T)
   concentrations, yolk mass, and egg mass were moderately to highly
   repeatable within females across years, whereas intrafemale consistency
   of maternal yolk androstenedione (A4) deposition was low yet
   statistically significant. Furthermore, maternal yolk T transfer, yolk
   mass, and egg mass were significantly heritable, whereas yolk A4
   transfer was not. These results strongly suggest that two major maternal
   yolk androgens are differentially regulated by genes and the
   environment. Selection on heritable variation in maternal yolk T
   deposition has the potential to shape the rate and direction of
   phenotypic change in offspring traits and can thereby accelerate or
   impede the response to selection in natural populations.}},

Abstract = {{Prenatal learning plays an important role in the ontogeny of behavior
   and birds provide a useful model to explore whether and how prenatal
   exposure to hormones of maternal origin can influence prenatal learning
   and the development of behavior. In this study we assessed if prenatal
   exposure to yolk testosterone can influence auditory learning in embryos
   of Northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus). We experimentally
   enhanced testosterone concentrations in bobwhite quail eggs prior to
   incubation. The embryos from these T-treated eggs as well as control
   embryos that had received the vehicle-only or were non-treated were
   exposed to an individual bobwhite hen's maternal call for 120 min over
   the course of the day prior to hatching. All chicks were tested at 24 h
   following hatching for their auditory preference between the familiar
   bobwhite maternal call versus an unfamiliar bobwhite maternal call.
   T-treated chicks spent significantly more time in proximity to the
   familiar call compared to the unfamiliar call and also showed shorter
   latencies to approach the familiar call than control birds. Increased
   emotional reactivity, i.e. propensity to express fear responses, was
   also found in T-treated chicks. Baseline heart rates recorded in a
   second group of T-treated embryos and control embryos did not differ,
   which suggests no effect of yolk testosterone on baseline arousal level.
   To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of the influence of
   prenatal exposure to testosterone on auditory learning. (C) 2009

Volume = {{115}},

Abstract = {{In many bird species prenatal exposure to yolk androgens of maternal
   origin has been found to influence offspring behavioural phenotype. In
   contrast to altricial birds, far less is known about maternal effects in
   precocial birds. In a previous experiment we found that female quail
   (Coturnix japonica) that were not previously habituated to humans (NH)
   produced eggs with less androgens (testosterone, androstenedione) and
   more progesterone when exposed to human disturbances than females
   habituated to humans (H). Here, we analysed social motivation and sexual
   behaviour of the male offspring of NH and H females. Classical
   behavioural test procedures were applied including separation, runway,
   partner choice and female encounter tests. As chicks, offspring of the
   NH females spent more time far from conspecifics than offspring of the H
   females. As adults, the same NH males showed less crowing and courtship
   behaviour (ritual preening) in female encounter tests than H males.
   Thus, maternal environment and egg quality may be key factors in the
   emergence of individual variability of appetitive behaviour, such as
   social proximity and courtship behaviour. Human disturbance of the
   mother seems to have triggered trans-generational effects resulting in
   consistently reduced social and sexual motivation in offspring until
   adulthood.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in maternal investments to offspring presumably reflects an
   optimization of resource allocation such that a female's fitness is
   maximized. In birds, both egg size and yolk constituents are examples of
   resources that can vary among offspring within a clutch. Egg size and
   maternally-derived steroid hormone concentrations present in yolk have
   been characterized for many species that lay small clutches or have
   altricial young, but little information is available for species that
   lay moderate to large clutches of precocial young. In this study, we
   recorded laying position, measured fresh egg mass and determined
   maternally-derived testosterone and estradiol concentrations present in
   yolks for whole clutches of free-living Canada geese Branta canadensis
   maxima to assess variation in maternal resources within clutches. We
   found that egg size varied non-linearly across the laying sequence such
   that first laid eggs were small, the largest eggs in the clutch occurred
   in the second and third positions, and size declined in eggs laid in
   subsequent positions. Concentration of testosterone in the yolk followed
   a pattern in which the first and second laid eggs have the highest
   concentrations within a clutch and declining concentrations in
   subsequently laid eggs. In contrast, maternally-derived yolk estradiol
   concentrations (measured in a subset of clutches) did not change across
   the laying sequence.}},

Abstract = {{The solicitation behaviours performed by dependent young are under
   selection from the environment created by their parents, as well as
   wider ecological conditions. Here we show how mechanisms acting before
   hatching enable canary offspring to adapt their begging behaviour to a
   variable post-hatching world. Cross-fostering experiments revealed that
   canary nestling begging intensity is positively correlated with the
   provisioning level of their own parents (to foster chicks). When we
   experimentally increased food quality before and during egg laying,
   mothers showed higher faecal androgen levels and so did their nestlings,
   even when they were cross-fostered before hatching to be reared by
   foster mothers that had been exposed to a standard regime of food
   quality. Higher parental androgen levels were correlated with greater
   levels of post-hatching parental provisioning and (we have previously
   shown) increased faecal androgens in chicks were associated with greater
   begging intensity. We conclude that androgens mediate environmentally
   induced plasticity in the expression of both parental and offspring
   traits, which remain correlated as a result of prenatal effects,
   probably acting within the egg. Offspring can thus adapt their begging
   intensity to variable family and ecological environments.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in yolk hormones is assumed to provide the plasticity
   necessary for mothers to individually optimize reproductive decisions
   via changes in offspring phenotype, the benefit being to maximise
   fitness. However, rather than routinely expecting adaptive variation
   within all species, the pattern and magnitude of yolk hormone deposition
   should theoretically relate to variation in life-histories. Here we
   present data on intra-clutch variation in yolk corticosterone in three
   species along a developmental continuum (European starling (Sturnus
   vulgaris): fully altricial; black guillemot (Cepphus grylle):
   semi-precocial; common eider (Somateria mollissima): fully precocial) to
   examine how and why variation in life-histories might relate to the
   evolution of variation in yolk steroids. Starlings and guillemots showed
   a significant increase in yolk corticosterone across the laying
   sequence; however, we found no pattern within eider clutches. Moreover,
   starlings showed the largest difference (94.6\%) in yolk corticosterone
   between first- and last-laid eggs, whereas guillemots showed a moderate
   difference (58.9\%). Despite these general species-specific patterns,
   individuals showed marked variation in the intra-clutch patterns of yolk
   corticosterone within each species indicating potential differences in
   intra-clutch flexibility among females. It is well documented that
   exposure to elevated yolk glucocorticoids reduces offspring quality at
   birth/hatching in many taxa and it has therefore been proposed that
   elevated yolk levels may modulate offspring competition and/or
   facilitate brood reduction under harsh conditions in birds. Our data
   suggests that intra-clutch variation in yolk corticosterone has the
   potential to act as an adaptive maternal effect in species where
   modulation of competition between nest-bound offspring would benefit
   mothers (starlings and guillemots). However, in precocial species where
   mothers would not benefit from a modulation of offspring quality,
   intra-clutch variation in yolk hormones may play little or no adaptive
   role. While future phylogenetically-controlled studies will be helpful
   in examining questions of adaptive mechanisms once more data on yolk
   corticosterone becomes available, our results nonetheless suggest that
   research on the evolutionary role of yolk hormones can benefit by a
   prior! incorporating species-specific life-history-driven hypotheses.

Abstract = {{Despite accumulating evidence that birds, in which females are the
   heterogametic sex, are able to manipulate primary offspring sex ratio,
   the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Steroid hormones. which govern
   female reproduction and are also accumulated by the developing follicle
   could potentially affect primary sex ratio by differential follicle
   development in relation to future sex and meiotic drive, or by sex
   specific influence on oocyte abortion or fertilization. So far,
   experimental results on the involvement of maternal testosterone (T) in
   offspring sex manipulation are ambiguous. To investigate the effect of T
   on primary sex ratio and elucidate underlying mechanisms, we elevated
   circulating T levels in female homing pigeons (Columba livia). During
   the course of the experiment females produced three clutches-before and
   during T implantation, and one year after implant removal. Intriguingly,
   first eggs, but not second eggs of T females were significantly male
   biased relative to sham-implanted controls. One year after cessation of
   the treatment the male bias was still present, indicating long-term
   effects on female reproductive physiology. T treatment did not affect
   maternal body condition, nor was body condition correlated with
   offspring sex ratio. Our data on timing of oviposition, lack of
   infertile eggs, and yolk weight indicate a possible role for sex
   specific follicle abortion, perhaps in combination with meiotic drive.
   However, despite T treatment elevating maternal plasma levels, egg yolk
   T concentrations did not differ between treatment groups and did not
   vary with embryo sex, suggesting that yolk T is not involved in meiotic
   drive. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Female birds deposit corticosterone into their eggs. Elevated
   concentrations of this hormone may interfere with the development of
   their offspring, and mothers should thus regulate corticosterone levels
   deposited into the eggs adaptively. However, if females are unable to
   regulate deposition, then the corticosterone concentration in eggs
   should reflect that in female plasma and should be influenced by
   stressors to the females. We measured corticosterone levels in the
   albumen of rockhopper penguins, and assessed their relationship with
   hatching order, human disturbance and laying date. Rockhopper penguins
   (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome) lay two eggs, of which the second egg
   (B-egg) is larger and hatches faster than the first egg (A-egg). The
   chick hatching from the B-egg is also much more likely to survive than
   its sibling. Albumen corticosterone concentrations were lower in B-eggs.
   However, as B-eggs contained more albumen than A-eggs, the total
   corticosterone deposited in the albumen was not significantly different
   between the two eggs. Daily disturbance by human observers during
   albumen production did not influence albumen corticosterone levels.
   Laying date had an effect on total albumen corticasterone through a
   higher albumen mass. However, we observed a high individual component in
   the composition of eggs from the same clutch. Thus, more work is
   required to explore the hypotheses of passive versus active transfer to
   eggs and to understand the adaptive value of contrary effects on the
   amount and concentration of corticosterone. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{In birds, female egg allocation patterns have a strong influence in
   offspring development and differential investment in egg size and
   composition has been shown to respond to male attractiveness. In this
   study we experimentally manipulated the perceived attractiveness of male
   starlings Sturnus unicolor by increasing the amount of green material in
   some nests (a male courtship display in this species). We predicted
   that, if female investment before laying is related to male
   attractiveness, experimental females would increase their reproductive
   investment in response to the addition of plants in their nests when
   compared to control females. We found that our manipulation caused
   variations in female reproductive investment in a way that seems to
   influence offspring quantity but not offspring quality: Females laid
   larger clutch sizes but not larger eggs when green plant material was
   added. However, yolk androgens contents were not related to the
   experimental manipulation. Contrary to expectations, females breeding in
   experimental nests laid eggs with smaller amounts of eggshell pigments.
   Interestingly, we found that eggs laid later in the sequence had higher
   testosterone levels and showed more intense egg colouration than eggs
   laid earlier in the sequence. These differences at the within-clutch
   level suggest that selection has favoured compensatory strategies for
   hatching asynchrony. Alternatively, since nest sabotages by other
   females are most common at the beginning of laying, this could be seen
   as female strategy to minimise losses due to nest sabotages. As far as
   we know, this is the first study to show that an external egg
   characteristic such as blue-green colouration reflects yolk androgen
   concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Species that depend on ephemeral habitat often evolve distinct dispersal
   strategies in which the propensity to disperse is closely integrated
   with a suite of morphological, behavioural and physiological traits that
   influence colonizing ability. These strategies are maintained by natural
   selection resulting from spatial and temporal variation in resource
   abundance and are particularly evident during range expansion. Yet the
   mechanisms that maintain close alignment of such strategies with
   resource availability, integrate suites of dispersal traits and generate
   variability in dispersal propensity are rarely known. Breeding females
   can influence offspring phenotype in response to changes in current
   environmental conditions, making maternal effects uniquely suited to
   bridge fluctuations in resource abundance in the maternal generation and
   variation in offspring dispersal ability. Western bluebirds' (Sialia
   mexicana) dependence on nest cavities-an ephemeral resource has led to
   the evolution of two distinct dispersal phenotypes: aggressive males
   that disperse and non-aggressive males that remain philopatric and
   cooperate with their relatives. Over the last 40 years, western
   bluebirds rapidly expanded their geographical range, providing us with
   an opportunity to test, in newly established populations, the importance
   of maternal effects for generating variability in dispersal propensity.
   Here, I show that, under variable resource conditions, breeding females
   group offspring of different competitive ability in different positions
   in the egg-laying order and, consequently, produce aggressive males that
   are more likely to disperse when resources are low and non-aggressive
   philopatric males when resources are abundant. I then show
   experimentally that the association between resource availability and
   sex-specific birth order is robust across populations. Thus, this
   maternal effect enables close tracking of resource availability and may
   explain how variation in dispersal is generated in newly colonized
   populations. More generally, these results suggest that, as a key source
   of variation in colonizing phenotypes, maternal effects are of crucial
   importance for understanding the dynamics of range expansion.}},

Abstract = {{Corticosterone exposure during prenatal development as a result of
   maternal upregulation of circulating hormone levels has been shown to
   have effects on offspring development in mammals. Corticosterone has
   also been documented in egg yolk in oviparous vertebrates, but the
   extent to which this influences phenotypic development is less studied.
   We show that maternal corticosterone is transferred to egg yolk in an
   oviparous lizard (the mallee dragon, Ctenophorus fordi Storr), with
   significant variation among clutches in hormone levels. Experimental
   elevation of yolk corticosterone did not affect hatching success,
   incubation period or offspring sex ratio. However, corticosterone did
   have a sex-specific effect on skeletal growth during embryonic
   development. Male embryos exposed to relatively high levels of
   corticosterone were smaller on average than control males at hatching
   whereas females from hormone-treated eggs were larger on average than
   control females. The data thus suggest that males are not just more
   sensitive to the detrimental effects of corticosterone but rather that
   the sexes may have opposite responses to corticosterone during
   development. Positive selection on body size at hatching for both sexes
   in this species further suggests that increased corticosterone in egg
   yolk may have sex-specific fitness consequences, with potential
   implications for sex allocation and the evolution of hormone-mediated
   maternal effects.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal yolk androgens in bird eggs represent an important pathway
   along which offspring phenotype is shaped. Most of the hormone-mediated
   maternal effects are highly important in the context of sibling
   competition. However, there is also increasing evidence for long-lasting
   effects far beyond the nestling period, and these effects may have
   important consequences on the reproductive success of the offspring.
   Here, we investigated the effects of experimentally elevated yolk
   testosterone concentrations on growth and reproduction in female
   canaries. Elevated yolk testosterone concentrations enhanced the
   post-natal growth rate, but not the asymptotic mass, and reduced the
   survival probability. The latter may be a consequence of the higher
   growth rate, which may have rendered females hatching from
   testosterone-treated eggs (T-females) more vulnerable to harsh
   environmental conditions. Adult T-females made a larger investment in
   their clutch by laying more but not heavier eggs than females hatching
   from control-treated eggs. Our results suggest that the observed
   long-lasting effect on clutch size relates to changes in the growth
   trajectory rather than being a direct consequence of testosterone, since
   studies manipulating early growth conditions obtained similar results.
   Clearly, further studies are now required in order to investigate the
   intriguing relationship between yolk testosterone, elevated growth
   rates, and clutch size.}},

Abstract = {{Offspring survival can be influenced by resources allocated to eggs,
   which in turn may be affected by the environmental factors the mother
   experiences during egg formation. In this study, we investigated whether
   experimentally elevated social interactions and number of neighbouring
   pairs influence yolk composition of collared flycatchers (Ficedula
   albicollis). Social challenge was simulated by presentation of a
   conspecific female. Experimental females spent more time near the cage
   and produced eggs with higher androgen concentration, but local breeding
   density did not affect yolk androgen level. Moreover, we found that
   females exposed to more intra-specific interactions and those that bred
   at higher density produced eggs with smaller yolk. These females may be
   more constrained in foraging time due to more frequent social
   encounters, and there might be increased competition for food at areas
   of higher density. In contrast, the present study did not reveal any
   evidence for the effect of social environment on yolk antioxidant and
   immunoglobulin levels. However, we found that yolk lutein and
   immunoglobulin concentrations were related to the female's H/L ratio.
   Also, yolk lutein and alpha-tocopherol levels showed a seasonal increase
   and were positively related to the female's plasma carotenoid level.
   Mothers may incur significant costs by transferring these compounds into
   the eggs, thus only females in good physiological condition and those
   that lay eggs later, when food is probably more abundant, could allocate
   higher amounts to the eggs without compromising their defence
   mechanisms. Our results suggest that environmental circumstances during
   egg formation can influence conditions for embryonic development.}},

Abstract = {{High corticosterone levels can have deleterious effects in developing
   avian embryos and chicks. Therefore, it may be adaptive for avian
   mothers to reduce corticosterone transfer to their eggs. However, until
   now, data about the active or/and passive role of mothers in
   corticosterone transfer to eggs are inconclusive. Here, we study
   maternal investment into A- and B-eggs of southern rockhopper penguins
   (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome). This species exhibits reversed
   hatching asynchrony and provides a unique model to test whether there is
   a strategic investment in corticosterone favoring the B-chick, which is
   most likely to survive. We found that rockhopper penguins had the
   highest yolk concentrations of any wild bird species studied so far.
   Contrary to our expectations, B-eggs had more yolk corticosterone both
   in concentration and in quantity than A-eggs, independently of the
   laying period and the level of human disturbance. Additionally, females
   deposited more yolk corticosterone in their eggs when they were
   disturbed. However, this disturbance effect was particularly strong for
   A-eggs and for late-laid eggs. The present data support neither the
   predictions for an active regulation nor for a passive deposition, and
   hormone deposition mechanisms still need to be explored. The adaptive
   value, if any, of high yolk corticosterone is presently unknown. (C)

Abstract = {{Mates and females are in conflict over parental care, as it would be
   favourable for one parent to shift labour to the other. Yolk hormones
   may offer a mechanism through which female birds could influence
   offspring traits in ways that increase the relative investment by the
   male. We studied the role of yolk androgens in mediating sexual conflict
   over parental care in the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis). In
   a cross-fostering experiment, the male's proportion of total feeding
   visits increased with increasing androgen levels in the foster eggs.
   This could suggest that sexual conflict over parental care may be
   influenced by the female's differential allocation of yolk androgens or
   a maternal effect associated with yolk androgens. However, when we
   experimentally elevated yolk androgen levels, male feeding rates did not
   differ between control and androgen-manipulated nests. This suggests
   that other egg components correlated with yolk androgen levels, rather
   than yolk androgen levels per se, may influence male parental effort. In
   conclusion, yolk androgens per se do not appear to mediate sexual
   conflict over parental investment in the collared flycatcher. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Maternally derived androgens have been shown to influence offspring
   phenotype in various ways. In birds, the benefits of prenatal androgen
   exposure, such as increased competitiveness and accelerated growth in
   nestlings, have been suggested to be balanced by costs, such as reduced
   immune function. In this study, we used an integrative approach to
   examine the influence of yolk androgens on the development of immune
   function in jackdaw (Corvus monedula) nestlings. Specifically, we tested
   whether the effects of yolk androgens on offspring immunity may extend
   over the first few days of life and be detectable even after several
   weeks. We manipulated yolk androgen concentrations in jackdaw eggs and
   estimated immune responsiveness by challenging the young with different
   pathogens at different stages of the nestling period. Six-day-old chicks
   hatched from eggs with elevated yolk androgen levels had lower
   pre-challenge antibody titres against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) than
   control chicks. However, antibody titres against LPS did not differ
   between treatment groups eight days after a challenge with LPS. During
   the late nestling phase, both humoral (towards diphtheria/tetanus
   antigens) and cell-mediated (towards phytohaemagglutinin) immune
   responsiveness were lower in chicks from yolk androgen-treated eggs
   compared with control chicks. Our experimental study on jackdaw chicks
   shows that elevated yolk androgen levels result in a general
   immunosuppression in offspring; this conclusion was based on results for
   several immunological tests of both humoral and cell-mediated immunity
   conducted at 1-2 and 3-4 weeks of age.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in the quality of the offspring environment can lead to the
   evolution of variable offspring provisioning. For variable offspring
   provisioning to evolve, the magnitude of provisioning per offspring must
   have effects on offspring and parental fitness.
   Females of the quacking frog, Crinia georgiana, produce clutches of eggs
   in which egg size varies between individuals in the population and also
   within clutches, independent of female size or condition. A trade-off
   between egg size and number exists.
   Using microsatellite markers to trace offspring to parents, and
   therefore clutch type, we tested the performance of tadpoles from
   clutches of large, small and variable-sized eggs in ponds in the field.
   Clutches of large eggs resulted in the highest parental fitness and
   clutches of small eggs resulted in lower parental fitness values.
   The parental fitness indicated that conditions in these ponds were
   harsh. Clutches with variable egg sizes had intermediate parental
   fitness but may be of benefit as a bet-hedging strategy when the
   qualities of ponds are unpredictable.
   This study provides new empirical evidence of important offspring and
   parental fitness consequences of variable maternal provisioning under
   natural conditions in the field and demonstrates the importance of
   moving experimental life-history studies out of the laboratory into the
   field where realistic selection pressures act on developing offspring.}},

Abstract = {{Birdsong differs from other sexual traits in that the acquisition
   process involves learning. Especially in close-ended learning species
   like the Bengalese finch, conditions experienced during the critical
   song-learning period can have a profound influence on song quality.
   Therefore, to understand song evolution from a life-history perspective,
   we investigated early ontogenetic effects on song quality. In
   particular, we focused on maternal effects and sibling competition. In
   asynchronously hatching bird species, the age hierarchy among nestlings
   affects physical development due to competition for food; mothers may
   influence this competition by adjusting their investment in each egg
   according to its sequence in the laying order. To independently assess
   these effects, chicks of the Bengalese finch were cross-fostered so that
   the age hierarchies formed in fostered broods were independent of the
   laying order. Our results indicate that song quality partially reflects
   early ontogenetic conditions, whereas song duration and note-type
   repertoire were independent of either laying order or age hierarchy. The
   syntactical complexity of note order declined over the laying sequence.
   This finding suggests that the song learning ability is influenced by
   within-clutch variation in maternal investment toward eggs. Considering
   that song syntactical complexity is subject to female preference in the
   Bengalese finch, it is likely that maternal resource allocation
   strategies play a role in song evolution.}},

Volume = {{55}},

Abstract = {{Maternal hormones in bird eggs modulate not only offspring development,
   but recently it has also been shown that these effects can persist into
   adult life. A number of long-lasting effects concern traits of which the
   expression or development is modulated by androgens. This suggests that
   the nature of yolk hormone-mediated maternal effects may be
   organizational. Maternal androgens may therefore play an important role
   in sexual selection, since the expression of sexually selected male
   characters is often androgen-dependent. We experimentally manipulated
   the yolk androgen concentrations of European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris)
   eggs. Subsequently we followed 49 unrelated males from hatching until
   year of first reproduction. We investigated the expression of multiple
   sexually selected male characters (song, beak color and throat feather
   characteristics), taking into account whether a trait is
   androgen-dependent.
   Elevated levels of yolk androgens affected the length of the embryonic
   period, but did not modify the expression of either androgen-dependent
   or androgen-independent sexually selected male characters including song
   phenotype at adulthood. Thus the most important function of yolk
   androgens in starlings and possibly other bird species may relate to the
   early developmental period. The outcome of our study together with the
   results of our meta-analysis indicates that the effects of yolk
   androgens on sexually selected male characters may be comparatively
   small. Our results suggest that this may relate to the numerous other
   environmental and/or genetic factors influencing the expression of
   sexually selected male characters. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{During egg formation, female birds deposit antibodies against parasites
   and pathogens they were exposed to before egg laying into the yolk. In
   captive bird species, it has been shown that these maternal
   immunoglobulins (maternal yolk IgGs) can protect newly hatched offspring
   against infection. However, direct evidence for such benefits in wild
   birds is hitherto lacking. We investigated (1) if nestling Great Tits
   Parus major originating from eggs with naturally high levels of maternal
   yolk IgG are less susceptible to a common, nest-based ectoparasite, (2)
   if maternal yolk IgGs influence nestling development and in particular,
   their own immune defence, and (3) if there is a negative correlation
   between levels of maternal yolk IgG in host eggs and the reproductive
   success of ectoparasitic fleas feeding on the nestlings. Counter to
   expectations, we found no indication that maternally transferred yolk
   IgGs have direct beneficial effects on nestling development, nestling
   immune response or nestling resistance or tolerance to fleas.
   Furthermore, we found no negative correlation between host yolk IgG
   levels and parasite fecundity. Thus, whereas previous work has
   unequivocally shown that prenatal maternal effects play a crucial role
   in shaping the parasite resistance of nestling birds, our study
   indicates that other egg components, such as hormones, carotenoids or
   other immuno-active substances, which bird females can adjust more
   quickly than yolk IgG, might mediate these effects.}},

Abstract = {{Trans-generational transfer of non-genetic, maternal resources such as
   hormones can have a substantial influence on offspring phenotype in many
   vertebrate species. In birds, maternal androgens enhance both growth and
   competitive behaviour, but also suppress the immune system. It has been
   hypothesised that high levels of egg androgens could also influence the
   prooxidant-antioxidant balance through their positive effect on growth
   and metabolism. We tested this hypothesis in the zebra finch
   (Taeniopygia guttata). Eggs were injected with testosterone dissolved in
   sesame oil or sesame oil only ( control). We subsequently assessed the
   effect of the egg hormone manipulation on nestling growth and nestling
   plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Growth rates of zebra finch
   nestlings were not significantly affected by egg hormone treatment.
   However, male offspring hatched from eggs with experimentally elevated
   testosterone had reduced plasma TAC at 10 days of age compared with male
   offspring hatching from control eggs. At the age of 34 days, males had
   similar plasma TAC irrespective of egg treatment. No effects of egg
   testosterone manipulation on nestling plasma TAC were found in females.
   Our results demonstrate that embryonic exposure to elevated levels of
   testosterone modulates chick antioxidant status, but this seems to be
   independent of chick growth. Sex-specific effects of prenatal
   testosterone on plasma TAC of zebra finch nestlings may have important
   consequences for sex allocation.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the well-known, long-term, organizational actions of sex
   steroids on phenotypic differences between the sexes, studies of
   maternal steroids in the vertebrate egg have mainly focused on effects
   seen in early life. Long-term organizational effects of yolk hormones on
   adult behavior and the underlying mechanisms that generate them have
   been largely ignored. Using an experiment in which hand-reared house
   sparrows (Passer domesticus) from testosterone- or control-treated eggs
   were kept under identical conditions, we show that testosterone
   treatment in the egg increased the frequency of aggressive, dominance,
   and sexual behavior of 1-year-old, reproductively competent house
   sparrows. We also show that circulating plasma levels of progesterone,
   testosterone, 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, and 17 beta-estradiol did not
   differ between treatment groups. Thus, a simple change in adult gonadal
   hormone secretion is not the primary physiological cause of long-term
   effects of maternal steroids on adult behavior. Rather, differences in
   adult behavior caused by exposure to yolk testosterone during embryonic
   development are likely generated by organizational modifications of
   brain function. Furthermore, our data provide evidence that
   hormone-mediated maternal effects are an epigenetic mechanism causing
   intra-sexual variation in adult behavioral phenotype. (c) 2008 Wiley

Abstract = {{Kratochvil et al. (Naturwissenschaften 95:209-215, 2008) reported
   recently that in the leopard gecko (Eublepharis macularius) of the
   family Eublepharidae with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD),
   clutches in which eggs were incubated at the same temperature produce
   only same-sex siblings. Interpreting this result in light of studies of
   sex steroid hormone involvement in sex determination, they suggested
   that maternally derived yolk steroid hormones could constrain
   sex-determining mechanisms in TSD reptiles. We have worked extensively
   with this species and have routinely incubated clutches at constant
   temperatures. To test the consistency of high frequency same-sex
   clutches across different incubation temperatures, we examined our
   records of clutches at the University of Texas at Austin from 1992 to
   2001. We observed that clutches in which eggs were incubated at the same
   incubation temperature produced mixed-sex clutches as well as same-sex
   clutches. Furthermore, cases in which eggs within a clutch were
   separated and incubated at different temperatures produced the expected
   number of mixed-sex clutches. These results suggest that maternal
   influences on sex determination are secondary relative to incubation
   temperature effects.}},

Abstract = {{The increase or decrease in yolk androgens over the laying sequence of a
   clutch in birds may mitigate or enhance, respectively, the disadvantage
   of the last-hatched chicks, providing a potentially adaptive tool to
   adjust brood size to food conditions. This variation may involve a
   genetic component on which Darwinian selection can act. We found that
   two lines of a wild bird species selected for bold and shy personalities
   show, respectively, increased and decreased androgen concentrations over
   the laying sequence. The line showing the increase laid earlier in the
   season, when food conditions are normally sufficient to raise the whole
   brood. The line showing the decrease laid later, when food is normally
   scarce, which may facilitate brood reduction. The results indicate a
   correlated response in maternal hormone transfer to genetic selection on
   personality, which relates to ecological conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The question of why maternal stress influences offspring phenotype is of
   significant interest to evolutionary physiologists. Although embryonic
   exposure to maternally derived glucocorticoids (i.e., corticosterone)
   generally reduces offspring quality, effects may adaptively match
   maternal quality with offspring demand. We present results from an
   interannual field experiment in European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris)
   designed explicitly to examine the fitness consequences of exposing
   offspring to maternally derived stress hormones. We combined a
   manipulation of yolk corticosterone (yolk injections) with a
   manipulation of maternal chick-rearing ability (feather clipping of
   mothers) to quantify the adaptive value of corticosterone-induced
   offspring phenotypes in relation to maternal quality. We then examined
   how corticosterone-induced ``matching{''} within this current
   reproductive attempt affected future fecundity and maternal survival.
   First, our results provide support that low-quality mothers transferring
   elevated corticosterone to eggs invest in daughters as predicted by sex
   allocation theory. Second, corticosterone-mediated sex-biased investment
   resulted in rapid male-biased mortality resulting in brood reduction,
   which provided a better match between maternal quality and brood demand.
   Third, corticosterone-mediated matching reduced investment in current
   reproduction for low-quality mothers, resulting in fitness gains through
   increased survival and future fecundity. Results indicate that the
   transfer of stress hormones to eggs by low-quality mothers can be
   adaptive since corticosterone-mediated sex-biased investment matches the
   quality of a mother to offspring demand, ultimately increasing maternal
   fitness. Our results also indicate that the branding of the proximate
   effects of maternal glucocorticoids on offspring as negative ignores the
   possibility that short-term phenotypic changes may actually increase
   maternal fitness.}},

Abstract = {{It has been proposed that blue colouration in eggs has evolved as a
   signal of female quality that males can use to modulate their parental
   investment. This hypothesis is based in the antioxidant properties of
   biliverdin whose costly deposition in the eggshell is expected to signal
   female antioxidant capacity and egg quality. Since maternally derived
   androgens are costly to produce and may adaptively affect offspring
   phenotype, high-quality females may benefit by signalling their androgen
   investment through egg colouration. Our aim was to investigate whether
   egg colour variation in the spotless starling reflected the amount of
   pigments on the eggshell and whether egg pigmentation was related to
   female and egg quality. Chromatography analyses revealed that spotless
   starling eggshells contained two different pigments: biliverdin and
   protoporphyrin IX with no correlation between them. Biliverdin contents
   correlated positively with egg colouration indicating that darker eggs
   with a higher peak in the blue-green segment of the spectrum contained
   higher amounts of biliverdin. Eggs containing more biliverdin were laid
   by high-quality females and contained higher yolk testosterone levels.
   However, despite the strong correlation between biliverdin and
   colorimetric variables, egg colouration did not reflect accurately
   female and egg quality. Our results provide evidence that eggshell
   pigmentation in the spotless starling is related to female and egg
   quality as shown by the yolk testosterone levels. However, the lack of
   relation between egg colour and female condition and egg quality do not
   provide evidence to support the signalling function of egg colouration.}},

Abstract = {{Females are expected to vary investment in offspring according to
   variables that may influence the offspring fitness in a way that
   optimises her inclusive fitness for a particular context. Thus, when
   sexual ornaments signal the quality of the male, females might invest in
   reproduction as a function of the attractiveness of their mate. We
   tested whether breeding conditions and male feet colour influence
   reproductive decisions of blue-footed booby females. In the blue-footed
   booby, male feet colour is a dynamic condition-dependent sexually
   selected trait that is related to paternal effort. During two
   consecutive years, an El Nino year (poor breeding conditions) and a year
   with good breeding conditions, we experimentally reduced male
   attractiveness by modifying their feet colour after the first egg was
   laid and recorded female investment in the second egg. We found that,
   relative to the first egg in the clutch, females laid heavier second
   eggs during the poor year than during the good year. Females paired with
   males with duller feet colour reduced second-egg mass and volume and
   delayed the laying of the second egg, independently of the year.
   Absolute yolk androstenedione (A4) concentration (but not testosterone,
   T) in second eggs was higher during a poor year than during a good year.
   Only during a year with poor breeding conditions, females paired with
   experimental males decreased the relative A4 concentration (but not T)
   in the second egg compared to control females. Thus, blue-footed booby
   females probably favour brood reduction by decreasing egg quality and
   increasing size asymmetry between chicks when the breeding and the mate
   conditions are poor.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal and environmental factors are important sources of phenotypic
   variation because both factors influence offspring traits in ways that
   impact offspring and maternal fitness. The present study explored the
   effects of maternal factors (maternal body size, egg size, yolk-steroid

   environmental factors on offspring phenotypes and sex ratios in a
   multi-clutching lizard with environmental sex determination
   (Amphibolurus muricatus). Maternal identity had strong effects on
   offspring morphology, but the nature of maternal effects differed among
   successive clutches produced by females throughout the reproductive
   season (i.e. maternal identity by environment interactions). The
   among-female and among-clutch variation in offspring traits (including
   sex ratios) was not mediated through maternal body size, egg size, or
   variation in yolk steroid hormones. This lack of nongenetic maternal
   effects suggests that phenotypic variation may be generated by gene by
   environment interactions. These results demonstrate a significant

Volume = {{149}},

Abstract = {{Maternal effects are typically thought to enhance rather than reduce
   offspring performance, but asynchronous hatching (ASH) in birds
   typically produces a size hierarchy within a clutch that frequently
   reduces the growth and survival of nestlings from eggs that hatch later.
   Given that yolk steroids can significantly affect offspring phenotype
   and that in many species the levels of yolk steroids have been found to
   increase with laying order, the maternal transfer of steroids to egg
   yolk has been proposed as a mechanism for females to offset the
   deleterious effects of ASH. To test this hypothesis, we determined
   whether yolk steroids varied with laying order or clutch size in Common
   Grackles (Quiscalus quiscula). Because ASH varies with clutch size
   (hatching span averages 48 h in five-egg clutches, 24 h in four-egg
   clutches) and regularly results in the starvation of later hatched
   nestlings, we predicted: (1) testosterone and 17 beta-estradiol levels
   should increase with laying order in both clutch sizes to mitigate the
   negative effects of ASH on last-hatched nestlings, and (2) the increase
   should be greater in five-egg clutches due to more pronounced hatching
   asynchrony. Using a competitive-binding steroid radioimmunoassay, we
   found no systematic variation in either testosterone or estradiol levels
   relative to laying order or clutch size. In the absence of evidence that
   yolk steroids interact adaptively with ASH, research must look elsewhere
   for potential benefits that might compensate for the costs these
   steroids impose on nestlings.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal functioning of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is
   paramount to maximizing fitness in vertebrates. Research in laboratory
   mammals has suggested that maternally-induced stress can cause
   significant variation in the responsiveness of an offspring's HPA axis
   involving both pre- and post-natal developmental mechanisms. However,
   very little is known regarding effects of maternal stress on the
   variability of offspring adrenocortical functioning in free-living
   vertebrates. Here we use an experimental approach that independently
   lowers the quality of both the pre- and post-natal developmental
   environment to examine programming and plasticity in the responsiveness
   of the HPA axis in fledglings of a free-living passerine, the European
   starling (Sturnus vulgaris). We found that mimicking a hormonal signal
   of poor maternal condition via an experimental prenatal increase in yolk
   corticosterone decreased the subsequent responsiveness of the HPA axis
   in fledglings. Conversely, decreasing the quality of the post-natal
   developmental environment (by decreasing maternal provisioning
   capability via a maternal feather-clipping manipulation) increased
   subsequent responsiveness of the HPA axis in fledglings, apparently
   through direct effects on nestling body condition. The plasticity of
   these responses was sex-specific with smaller female offspring showing
   the largest increase in HPA reactivity. We suggest that pre-natal,
   corticosterone-induced, plasticity in the HPA axis may be a `predictive
   adaptive response' (PAR): a form of adaptive developmental plasticity
   where the advantage of the induced phenotype is manifested in a future
   life-history stage. Further, we introduce a new term to define the
   condition-driven post-natal plasticity of the HPA axis to an
   unpredictable post-natal environment, namely a `reactive adaptive
   response' (RAR). This study confirms that the quality of both the pre-
   and post-natal developmental environment can be a significant source of
   variation in the responsiveness of the HPA axis, and provides a
   frame-work for examining ecologically-relevant sources of stress-induced
   programming and plasticity in this endocrine system in a free-living
   vertebrate, respectively. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{1. Maternal effects describe how mothers influence offspring life

   allocation to young, often identified by variation in propagule size,

   2. Using a laboratory model system, the soil mite Sancassania berlesei,
   we show that, controlling for egg size, older mothers lay eggs that
   hatch later, develop more slowly, and mature at larger body sizes.
   3. Such differences in life histories lead to marked population
   dynamical effects lasting for multiple generations, as evidenced by an
   experiment initiated with similarly sized eggs that came from young or
   old mothers. Differences in maturation from the initial cohort led to
   differences in population structure and life history that propagated the
   initial differences over time.
   4. Maternal-age effects, which are not related to gross provisioning of

Abstract = {{Avian egg yolks are made up of complex mixtures of physiologically
   relevant substances. Androgens, in particular, accumulate in yolks in
   variable amounts based on social and environmental conditions
   experienced by laying females, and using experimental elevations of yolk
   androgen content, researchers have unveiled potent physiological and
   behavioral effects on offspring. These patterns and effects are exciting
   in an adaptive context, as the transfer of endogenously-produced
   substances such as androgens to egg yolks may allow fine manipulation of
   offspring phenotype to maximize reproductive success. However, to gain
   an in-depth understanding of how yolk androgens function in an adaptive
   context, we must first understand the complex entanglement of
   physiological and endocrine interrelationships that change after
   exposure to yolk androgens. Here, we take a comparative approach towards
   a discussion of how yolk androgens can simultaneously affect multiple
   body systems within developing birds, ultimately resulting in the
   large-scale phenotypic endpoints that may represent adaptive
   consequences of exposure to elevated levels of yolk androgens. (c) 2008

Abstract = {{It is widely believed that female birds strategically allocate androgens
   to yolk in the manner that best equips offspring for feeding conditions
   during their development. Because most avian studies have focused on
   multi-egg clutch species, and interpreted results within the framework
   of sibling competition, we still know little about how yolk androgens
   might be allocated in direct response to environmental conditions. Most
   oceanic birds are long-lived and lay single-egg clutches, and their
   breeding success is tightly linked to highly variable marine production.
   That combination: a variable breeding environment, long lives, and
   single-egg clutches, makes oceanic birds good subjects to test
   hypotheses about yolk androgen allocation strategies. We measured
   concentrations of two yolk androgens, androstenedione (A4) and
   testosterone (T), in the single-egg clutches laid by early-laying
   Cassin's (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) and rhinoceros (Cerorhinca
   monocerata) auklets at Triangle Island, British Columbia, Canada, in
   2002-2004. Environmental conditions including sea-surface temperatures
   and the timing and intensity of marine primary production varied over
   the 3 years, and in response, both the timing and success of seabird
   breeding varied. As in other avian species, concentrations of A4 and T
   varied markedly among individual eggs in both species (by factors of
   3-8), yet contrary to expectation, little of the variation could be
   attributed to year effects. The high interindividual variation and the
   lack of interannual variation suggest a non-adaptive explanation for
   yolk androgen deposition relative to environmental conditions in these
   species. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1989-1994}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In species with biparental care, a female gains fitness benefits from
   the joint reproductive investment of herself and her partner, but pays
   only the costs of her own care. Selection thus favours mechanisms that
   allow females to elicit a higher paternal investment from their
   partners. In oviparous species, the allocation of maternal yolk
   androgens to the eggs might represent such a female adaptation to
   sexually antagonistic selection. To test this hypothesis, we
   experimentally blocked the effects of maternal yolk androgens by an
   injection of the antiandrogen flutamide or a control substance in the
   eggs of great tits, Parus major. We subsequently manipulated the food
   demand of the brood in a brood size manipulation experiment, and
   recorded the parental feeding rates. The males' food-provisioning rates
   were not significantly influenced by the actions of maternal yolk
   androgens, whereas females adjusted their parental effort to
   androgen-mediated nestling signals, in particular in enlarged broods.
   These results show that female great tits do not exploit the male's
   contribution to parental care by allocating high concentrations of yolk
   androgens to their eggs. However, they indicate that variation in yolk
   androgen allocation among females has evolved through a process of
   coadaptation that matches maternal food provisioning and offspring
   demand. (c) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Avian eggs contain substantial amounts of maternal yolk androgens, which
   have been shown to modulate offspring phenotype. The first studies on
   the functional consequences of maternal yolk androgens have focused on
   early life stages and their role in sibling competition. However, recent
   longitudinal studies reported long-lasting effects of maternal yolk
   androgens on offspring phenotype, mostly concerning traits that are
   sensitive to androgens. This suggests that maternal yolk androgens could
   play an important role in sexual selection, since the expression of many
   male sexual characters is testosterone-dependent. Using male canaries as
   a model, we examined the consequences of an experimental elevation of
   yolk testosterone concentrations on early development as well as
   long-lasting effects particularly on song, which is one of the most
   important sexual characters in male songbirds. Elevated yolk
   testosterone concentrations inhibited male growth, possibly in
   interaction with an existent ectoparasite exposure. Males hatched from
   testosterone-treated eggs (T-males) did not have enhanced competitive
   skills, in contrast to previous studies. The elevation of yolk
   testosterone concentrations delayed song development but did not affect
   adult song phenotype. This is intriguing, as yolk testosterone possibly
   induced developmental stress, which is known to reduce song quality. We
   hypothesize that yolk testosterone has either no direct effect on adult
   song phenotype, or that positive effects are merged by the negative
   effects of developmental stress. Finally, females mated with T-males
   invested more in their clutch indicating that females either assess
   T-males as more attractive (differential allocation hypothesis) or
   compensated for lower offspring viability (compensation hypothesis). (C)

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, birds have proven to be excellent models to study
   hormone-mediated maternal effects in an evolutionary framework. Almost
   all these studies focus on the function of maternal steroid hormones for
   offspring development, but lack of knowledge about the underlying
   mechanisms hampers further progress. We discuss several hypotheses
   concerning these mechanisms, point out their relevance for ecological
   and evolutionary interpretations, and review the relevant data. We first
   examine whether maternal hormones can accumulate in the egg
   independently of changes in hormone concentrations in the maternal
   circulation. This is important for Darwinian selection and female
   physiological trade-offs, and possible mechanisms for hormone
   accumulation in the egg, which may differ among hormones, are reviewed.
   Although independent regulation of plasma and yolk concentrations of
   hormones is conceivable, the data are as yet inconclusive for ovarian
   hormones. Next, we discuss embryonic utilization of maternal steroids,
   since enzyme and receptor systems in the embryo may have coevolved with
   maternal effect mechanisms in the mother. We consider dose response
   relationships and action pathways of androgens and argue that these
   considerations may help to explain the apparent lack of interference of
   maternal steroids with sexual differentiation. Finally, we discuss
   mechanisms underlying the pleiotropic actions of maternal steroids,
   since linked effects may influence the coevolution of parent and
   offspring traits, owing to their role in the mediation of physiological
   trade-offs. Possible mechanisms here are interactions with other
   hormonal systems in the embryo. We urge endocrinologists to embark on
   suggested mechanistic studies and behavioural ecologists to adjust their
   interpretations to accommodate the current knowledge of mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Embryonic development rates are reflected by the length of incubation
   period in birds, and these vary substantially among species within and
   among geographical regions. The incubation periods are consistently
   shorter in North America (Arizona study site) than in tropical
   (Venezuela) and subtropical (Argentina) South America based on the study
   of 83 passerine species in 17 clades. Parents, mothers in particular,
   may influence incubation periods and resulting offspring quality through
   proximate pathways, while variation in maternal strategies among species
   can result from selection by adult and offspring mortality. Parents of
   long-lived species, as is common in the tropics and subtropics, may be
   under selection to minimize costs to themselves during incubation.
   Indeed, time spent incubating is often lower in the tropical and
   subtropical species than the related north temperate species, causing
   cooler average egg temperatures in the southern regions. Decreased egg
   temperatures result in longer incubation periods and reflect a cost
   imposed on offspring by parents because energy cost to the embryo and
   risk of offspring predation are both increased. Mothers may adjust egg
   size and constituents as a means to partially offset such costs. For
   example, reduced androgen concentrations in egg yolks may slow
   development rates, but may enhance offspring quality through
   physiological trade-offs that may be particularly beneficial in
   longer-lived species, as in the tropics and subtropics. We provide
   initial data to show that yolks of tropical birds contain substantially
   lower concentrations of growth-promoting androgens than north temperate
   relatives. Thus, maternal (and parental) effects on embryonic
   development rates may include contrasting and complementary proximate
   influences on offspring quality and deserve further field study among
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Early maternal effects in the form of substances accumulated in the egg,
   such as carotenoids and hormones, can be physiologically relevant for a
   good development of offspring. It has been found in different species
   that testosterone (T) can be beneficial to offspring by increasing
   growth rate, but detrimental by reducing immunocompetence and increasing
   oxidative stress. Carotenoids on the other hand are suggested to be
   beneficial because they can counteract the oxidative stress and the
   immune-depressive effect of T. In this study we analyzed the effect of
   prenatal T exposure in the grey partridge. We injected eggs with three
   doses of T (high, intermediate, and physiological). After hatching,
   chicks exposed to a prenatal high dose of T were fed with two diets
   (rich or poor) differing in beta-carotene content. We found a
   significant effect of T on both chick growth and cell-mediated immunity,
   with high T doses resulting in detrimental effects while low doses were
   beneficial. Detrimental effects of the high dose of T on immunity were
   mitigated by P-carotene consumed in the diet. The differences between
   groups were observed in the early period of life (age 10 days for mass,
   and age 10 and 21 days for immunity), and disappeared in the following
   period, and up to 1 and 2years later. Overall, our observations show
   that T in the egg is not detrimental but beneficial, and that negative
   effects are found only at supraphysiological concentrations. The
   negative effects of T on immunity could be balanced if chicks could
   consume a diet rich in beta-carotene. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Volume = {{75}},

Abstract = {{Dominance is a relative measure that allows asymmetrical relationships
   between individuals to be quantified. These kinds of relationships often
   depend on aggressive behaviour and the steroid hormone most frequently
   associated with aggressiveness is testosterone. Testosterone is present
   in both sexes and implanting it can provoke a rise of individual
   aggressiveness leading consequently to an increase of social status.
   Many researchers have studied the relationship between plasma
   testosterone and dominance but few have focused on yolk testosterone and
   social hierarchy. Thus we aimed to study the possible influence of the
   mother's social status on egg yolk testosterone deposition. Our
   hypothesis is that dominant females lay eggs containing more
   testosterone than subordinate females. We recorded the social hierarchy
   of 24 female domesticated canaries, Serinus canaria, and studied the
   influence of their social status on the concentration of testosterone in
   their egg yolks and on other egg characteristics. Our results show a
   significant relationship between a mother's social status and the amount
   of testosterone deposited in its yolks: the more dominant the females
   are, the more concentrated in testosterone their eggs are. Our results
   also show that yolk testosterone increases with laying order, whereas no
   relationship between mothers' rank number and their clutch size or egg
   mass was found. We conclude that there is a clear effect of maternal
   social status on yolk testosterone and discuss dominance inheritance.

Abstract = {{The concentration of yolk steroids was suggested to influence offspring
   gender in oviparous animals subject to both temperature-dependent sex
   determination (TSD) and genotypic sex determination (GSD). However, the
   proposed mechanisms of steroid effects are thought to differ between TSD
   and GSD: a direct effect of oestrogens on gonad feminisation in TSD
   species vs a differential induction of male-producing or
   female-producing gametes in GSD species. Geckos offer an ideal
   opportunity for testing these suggested mechanisms. Closely related
   gecko species differ in their modes of sex determination. They lay
   clutches of two synchronously formed eggs; both eggs share equal steroid
   levels. If identical hormonal composition and environment during
   vitellogenesis, gravidity and incubation determine the sex of the
   progeny, siblings should share the same gender in both TSD and GSD
   geckos. We found strong support for this prediction in a TSD gecko
   species. Among clutches that were incubated at the temperature that
   produced both sexes, there were no clutches with siblings of the
   opposite sex. On the other hand, about half of the clutches yielded
   siblings of the opposite sex in four GSD species. These results suggest
   that sex-determining systems constrain the ability of the female to
   produce single-sex siblings and, hence, it seems that the GSD mechanism
   constrains the opportunities for sex ratio manipulation in geckos via
   yolk steroid manipulation.}},

Abstract = {{Maternally derived androgen hormones concentrate in avian egg yolks as
   the yolks grow on the female's ovary, possibly forming a basis for
   important maternal effects in birds. In the American kestrel (Falco
   sparverius), experimental elevation of yolk androgens in the first-laid
   egg of a clutch (a-egg) to the concentrations found naturally in a
   clutch's later-laid eggs reduces the growth rate of a-egg nestlings
   compared to controls. These findings, together with discoveries from
   other species that the effects of yolk androgens on growth of female
   nestlings may differ from their effects on growth of male nestlings,
   raise the hypothesis that natural changes in yolk-androgen
   concentrations with laying order are ultimately due to a difference
   between the sexes in their yolk-androgen sensitivity and between early-
   and late-laid eggs in their sex ratio. By re-analyzing previously
   published data and adding to the analysis data from previously
   unanalyzed blood samples used for sex determination, we investigated
   possible sex-specific effects of yolk-androgens in the context of a
   potential sex-biased laying order in free-living American kestrels. We
   used a multi-level, mixed model with a Gompertz function to analyze
   growth of nestlings hatching from a-eggs that were control-treated or in
   which we experimentally elevated yolk-androgen concentrations shortly
   after laying to the higher concentrations naturally found in later-laid
   eggs. We discovered that male nestlings were more susceptible than
   female nestlings to growth inhibition by yolk-androgen elevation but did
   not find a bias in sex ratio with respect to laying order. Together,
   these findings do not support the above hypothesis. However, they are
   consistent with the hypothesis that sex differences in yolk-androgen
   sensitivity enable mothers to economically tune reproductive effort to
   an individual offspring's reproductive value, which can vary more for
   one sex than the other.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal hormones are an excellent pathway for the mother to influence
   offspring development, and birds provide exceptional opportunities to
   study these hormone-mediated maternal effects. Two dominant hypotheses
   about the function of yolk androgens in avian eggs concern maternal
   manipulation of sibling competition and post hatching paternal care. In
   megapodes, however, neither sibling competition nor post hatching
   parental care exists. Eggs are incubated by external heat sources, and
   chicks dig themselves out of their underground nest and live
   independently of their parents and their siblings. In this first study
   on egg androgens of such a megapode, the Australian Brush-turkey
   Alectura lathami, we found nevertheless substantial amounts of maternal
   androgens. Since size of the incubation mound, incubation temperature,
   egg size and laying date greatly vary in this species, we analysed
   variation in testosterone (T), androstenedione (A4) and
   dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in relation to these factors. T concentrations
   were significantly higher in eggs from bigger mounds and laid at greater
   depth, which may compensate via anabolic effects for the longer duration
   and higher energetic requirements of chicks when digging themselves out.
   T concentrations were higher in smaller eggs, and both yolk A4 and T
   concentrations increased with laying date, perhaps as a compensatory
   measure, while DHT concentrations only varied across different mounds.
   These results indicate that maternal androgens may influence offspring
   development outside the contexts of sibling competition or parental
   care. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, evidence is mounting that females can adaptively engineer the
   quality of their offspring via the deposition of yolk compounds,
   including carotenoids and androgens. In this study, we simultaneously
   consider how both carotenoids and androgens in egg yolk relate to
   parental quality in barn swallows (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster).
   First, we found no relationship between concentrations or amounts of
   yolk androgens and carotenoids. Yolk carotenoids decreased with laying
   order, whereas we found no relationship between yolk androgens and
   laying order. Second, we tested the Investment Hypothesis, which
   predicts that high-quality females or females paired to high quality
   mates, allocate differentially more of these yolk compounds to their
   offspring. For carotenoids, we mostly found evidence to counter
   predictions of the Investment hypothesis: (1) Carotenoid concentrations
   varied among females, (2) heavier eggs contained lower carotenoid
   concentrations, although heavier yolks contained greater amounts of
   carotenoids, (3) eggs of earlier-laying females had lower concentrations
   in their eggs, and (4) yolk carotenoids were not correlated with clutch
   size or male plumage ornamentation. For androgens, we found weak support
   for the Investment Hypothesis: (1) Yolk androgens varied among females,
   (2) heavier eggs and yolks contained greater amounts, although not
   concentrations of androgens, (3) females paired to more colorful males
   laid eggs with greater concentrations of androgens, and (4) no effects
   of laying date or morphological correlates of female quality on androgen
   concentrations in egg yolks. Overall, these findings suggest that each
   yolk compound may have different functions and therefore may be
   regulated by different mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Social competition among female birds has been shown to positively
   affect yolk androgen levels, perhaps providing a mechanism to
   communicate environmental conditions to offspring. Whether this
   relationship is due to social density or to differences among mothers
   that breed in different social situations is unclear. We manipulated
   breeding density to test these alternative explanations. Yolk androgens
   were measured in clutches of European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris,
   breeding in consecutive years in outdoor aviaries of different sizes and
   with varying numbers of breeding pairs. Testosterone (T) levels
   increased significantly with increasing density. Dihydrotestosterone
   (DHT) levels increased with the number of nest boxes available. The
   number of nest boxes monopolized by a breeding male negatively affected
   androstenedione (A4) levels, positively affected DHT levels and did not
   affect T levels. Other factors related to social interactions or
   competition among females (including polygyny) did not influence yolk
   hormone levels. Within-female yolk androgen levels were highly
   consistent over two consecutive years even though females were breeding
   in opposite breeding densities during each year, suggesting that
   individual characteristics are important determinants of variation in
   maternal androgen allocation in addition to potential effects of
   environmental conditions. This within-female consistency of yolk
   androgen levels across years has important implications.}},

Abstract = {{The avian egg contains maternal hormones that affect behavior, growth,
   morphology, and offspring survival. Evidence to date suggests that
   patterns of yolk androgen deposition could provide females with a means
   to manipulate sibling competition and, thereby, increase their fitness.
   We examined yolk testosterone (T) concentrations in eggs of the
   smooth-billed ani (Crotophaga ani) to understand patterns of androgen
   deposition in eggs of this plural-breeding joint-nesting cooperatively
   breeding species. We tested the hatching; asynchrony adjustment
   hypothesis, which states that increases in yolk androgen levels over the
   laying sequence function to mitigate the disadvantage of being a
   later-hatched chick in species without adaptive brood reduction. We also
   investigated the effect of group size on yolk T deposition to test the
   hypothesis that females in multi-female groups could give a competitive
   edge to their own chicks by depositing higher T levels in their eggs.
   Predictions of the hatching asynchrony adjustment hypothesis were
   supported in both single- and multi-female groups as yolk testosterone
   levels increased from early- to late-laid eggs. This suggests that ani
   females can influence nestling competition and chick survival by
   within-clutch differential T allocation. Unexpectedly, we did not
   observe an effect of group size on yolk T deposition. Yolk testosterone
   concentrations may not be a mere reflection of a female's hormonal
   status as female plasma circulating levels of T did not vary in the same
   direction as yolk T levels. Results of this study therefore support the
   idea that females may adaptively manipulate chick behavior through
   hormonal deposition in eggs. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal glucocorticoids are known to affect offspring phenotype in
   numerous vertebrate taxa. In birds, the maternal transfer of
   corticosterone to eggs was recently proposed as a hormonal mechanism by
   which offspring phenotype is matched to the relative quality of the
   maternal environment. However, current hypotheses lack supporting
   information on both intra- and inter-clutch variation in yolk
   corticosterone for wild birds. As such, we examined variation in yolk
   corticosterone levels in a wild population of European starlings
   (Sturnus vulgaris). Maternal condition, clutch size and nesting density
   were all negatively related to yolk conicosterone deposition, females
   with high condition indices, those laying larger clutches and those
   nesting in high-density associations deposited lower amounts of the
   lion-none into eggs than those with low condition indices, laying small
   clutches and nesting in isolation. Alternatively, we found no effects of
   maternal age or human disturbance on yolk corticosterone deposition.
   Intra-clutch variation of yolk corticosterone was significant, with
   levels increasing across the laying sequence in all clutch sizes
   examined, with the difference between first and last-laid eggs being
   greater in large versus small clutches. Given the reported effects of
   yolk corticosterone on offspring size and growth, intra-clutch variation
   in yolk corticosterone has the potential to alter the competitive
   environment within a brood. Furthermore, our results indicate that
   variation in yolk corticosterone can originate from variation in both
   the mother's quality as well as the quality of her breeding environment.
   The presence of inter-female variation in particular is an important
   pre-requisite in testing whether the exposure of offspring to
   maternally-derived corticosterone is a mechanistic link between
   offspring phenotypic plasticity and maternal quality. (c) 2007 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Individual differences in animal behavior can be attributed to genetic
   as well as non-genetic influences. One mechanism by which the behavioral
   phenotype of an individual can be shaped is via transmission of maternal
   sex steroids. In this study, we examined the role of yolk testosterone
   (T) in controlling neophobia in 9-month-old, sexually mature zebra
   finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Offspring hatched from either T-treated
   or control eggs were subjected to a sequential series of behavioral
   tests in which we measured the neophobic response and its persistence
   towards two unfamiliar stimuli. Birds from T-treated and control eggs
   did not differ in their latencies to approach and eat a novel food
   source during their first encounter. However, egg treatment affected
   subsequent habituation. Latencies decreased in both groups over a
   habituation period of 5 days, but considerably more so in T-offspring.
   Although males appeared to approach novel food faster than females,
   there was no overall sex effect during the habituation period. When a
   novel object was added in combination with the previously learned food
   stimulus, this caused an behavioral shift in approach latencies. In
   males, control offspring had significantly shorter latencies than
   T-offspring, whereas there was no difference among females. The latency
   to eat in the same test was not significantly affected by sex or egg
   treatment. Our results demonstrate long-term effects of prenatal T on
   neophobic responses in adult zebra finches. We hypothesize that prenatal
   T may be one underlying mechanism for individual differences routine
   formation. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Previous experiments indicate that artificial elevation of egg
   corticosterone content prior to incubation may increase fear of humans,
   reduce the willingness to compete with conspecifics and reduce the
   growth rate of chicks hatching from these eggs. It can also be
   hypothesized that corticosterone-treated chicks might be more sensitive
   to the effects of stress after hatching. Accordingly, we tested the
   effect of embryonic corticosterone exposure (5.5 ng/ml egg) and
   intermittent handling after hatching on the behaviour and growth of 88
   vehicle-treated (40 males and 48 females) and 88 corticosterone-treated
   (40 males and 48 females) chicks. The injection treatment did not have
   any significant effects on tonic immobility (P <= 0.23), but tended to
   increase the male's willingness to feed in a competitive environment (P
   <= 0. 10). However, post-hatch handling increased the duration of tonic
   immobility in corticosterone-treated birds but not in controls (P <=
   0.01), as reflected in the interaction between the injection and
   handling treatments (P <= 0.01). Intermittent handling but not
   corticosterone treatment reduced the willingness of male birds to eat in
   a competitive situation, but neither treatment affected this behaviour
   in females. The present results suggest that the effect of embryonic
   corticosterone exposure may be dependent on the hormone dosage and the
   environment to which birds are exposed after hatching. (C) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This experiment aimed at testing the hypothesis that exposing hens to

   stress and the associated changes in egg hormone content was predicted
   to alter offspring behaviour. Parental hens were 40 White Lohmann
   Selected Leghorns, half of which were exposed to an unpredictable feed
   restriction treatment. After application of the treatment, birds in the
   treatment group had higher concentrations of faecal corticosterone
   metabolites than birds in the control group. The treatment had no effect
   on the weight of treated birds or on the concentration of corticosterone
   in the yolk or albumen of their eggs. Sixty progeny (30 per treatment)
   were tested for effects on growth and behaviour. No effects of the
   treatment on the hatchability of eggs or progeny body weight were
   registered, but treated birds had a higher duration of tonic immobility
   in response to manual restraint and spent less time eating, when
   competing with birds from the control group for access to feed in a

Abstract = {{In lizards as in many other kinds of animals, strong maternal effects on
   the phenotypic traits of hatchlings are frequently reported. One
   plausible non-genetic mechanism that might produce such differences
   among clutches involves maternal allocation of steroid hormones. Lizard
   eggs often display considerable inter-clutch variation in the quantities
   of maternally allocated steroids, and exogenous application of such
   steroids has been reported to influence the phenotypic traits
   (especially, sex) of hatchlings. We examined correlations between
   naturally occurring yolk steroid levels and offspring traits in the
   scincid lizard Bassiana duperreyi, and also conducted experimental
   trials (exogenous application of testosterone or 17 beta-oestradiol to
   eggs) to test for causal effects of hormones. Although exogenous
   hormones readily reversed sex of the hatchling lizards, no other
   phenotypic traits of the hatchlings (morphology, locomotor performance)
   were significantly correlated with naturally occurring levels of
   testosterone, dihydrotestosterone or estrogen, nor were these phenotypic
   traits significantly affected by exogenous application of hormones.
   Hence, our results do not support the hypothesis that reproducing female
   lizards manipulate the phenotypic traits of their offspring by
   differential allocation of steroid hormones. Crown copyright (C) 2007

   exposure to elevated testosterone were observed in the open-field test
   in all three experiments which indicated inhibition of behavioural
   responses in hatchlings. Birds treated with testosterone in ovo
   displayed longer latency to leave the start square, decreased locomotor
   activity, enhanced defecation and lower number of distress calls as
   compared to control birds. In TI test, the influence of treatment was
   manifested at the highest concentration only. Hatchlings from
   testosterone treated eggs expressed longer duration of TI and required
   less attempts to induce TI in comparison with the control group.
   Our results demonstrated increased fearfulness of Japanese quail chicks
   hatched from eggs with experimentally elevated testosterone content. The
   effect is specific for a short period after hatching since previous
   studies reported stimulatory effect of yolk testosterone on behaviour of
   Japanese quail later in ontogeny.}},

Abstract = {{The field of androgen deposition in avian eggs and its consequences for
   offspring development has received a lot of attention in recent
   research. However, although variation within Clutches in yolk androgens
   is relatively well understood, the adaptive significance of patterns of
   variation between clutches remains rather unclear. Furthermore, it has
   been hypothesized that yolk androgens act as a means of an adaptive
   maternal effect to adjust offspring to a given posthatching environment.
   Thus, the consequences of maternal yolk androgens for offspring
   development are likely to depend on the specific environment of a given
   brood. We experimentally manipulated yolk androgen concentrations in
   spotless starling eggs, using a between-brood design in which full
   broods were manipulated applying either an androgen or sham treatment,
   in order to test the effects of between-brood variation in yolk androgen
   levels. We also included in the analysis several female characters that
   have been shown to affect androgen deposition. Androgen-chicks tended to
   gain more mass, a similar effect to that shown in previous studies where
   direct competition between chicks belonging to different treatments was
   allowed, but did not gain a survival benefit. Androgen-chicks had wider
   beak flanges, an effect that has not been described previously and could
   play an important role in food acquisition. In addition, androgen-chicks
   had higher endogenous plasma levels of androgens, which could induce
   higher begging intensity. We hypothesize that these effects are an
   important mechanistic link for our understanding of how yolk androgens
   exert their effects on offspring development after hatching. Contrary to
   our predictions, we found no evidence that the observed effects depended
   on the environment under which it was investigated. Because high yolk
   androgen levels seem to be beneficial for nestlings in this species, we
   hypothesize that yolk hormone deposition could be costly for females or
   alternatively that potential negative effects later in adulthood may
   constrain maternal hormone allocation.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal effects, such as investment in eggs, have profound effects on
   offspring fitness. Mothers are expected to skew their investment
   depending on the laying order and sex when unequal sibling competition
   occurs within a brood because of sex-specific vulnerability and age
   hierarchy caused by asynchronous hatching. The Bengalese finch hatches
   asynchronously and shows a moderate reversed sexual size dimorphism.
   However, contrary to commonly accepted assumptions of size-dependent
   vulnerability, the smaller sex (male) is more vulnerable to
   developmental stress caused by sibling competition. We investigated
   whether maternal investment would be biased by the position in laying
   order and the sex of eggs, and also explored the possible differences in
   growth patterns depending on sex, laying order, and age hierarchy by
   observing chicks fostered to experimentally manipulated broods where
   brood composition was controlled and age hierarchy was more enhanced
   than in natural breeding conditions. We found that overall patterns of
   maternal investment favored the disadvantageous sectors of sibling
   competition, i.e., eggs of later laying order and sons over those of
   early laying order and daughters. We also examined the effect of laying
   order on adult body size and sex differences in growth patterns. When
   reared in the subordinate age hierarchy, females could compensate for
   the deficit of decreased growth rate by taking longer to mature, whereas
   males could not. We suggest that this sex-specific growth pattern could
   be the cause of sex differences in vulnerability to early developmental
   stress.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal effects facilitate adaptation to changing environments because
   they alter individual offspring traits to match current conditions. We
   show that maternal effects can also resolve context-dependent,
   correlational selection on multiple offspring traits, promoting
   adaptation to more complex environments. In side-blotched lizards (Uta
   stansburiana), two alternative pathways of dorsal pattern induction
   involve maternal oestradiol and alleles for throat colouration (similar
   to social strategy). In one pathway, females increased yolk oestradiol
   when mated to yellow-throated sires; oestradiol induced dorsal barring
   in yellow-throated progeny of both sexes. In another pathway, females
   elevated yolk oestradiol in response to a high frequency of orange
   alleles in experimental social neighbourhoods. When the sire lacked
   yellow alleles, this secondary pathway resulted in striped, orange sons
   and striped, non-orange daughters. All maternally induced types had high
   fitness in the wild. These results illustrate a (previously undescribed)
   mechanism for females to simultaneously resolve differing correlational
   selection pressures on different progeny.}},

Abstract = {{The transfer of non-genetic resources from mother to the offspring often
   has considerable consequences for offspring performance. In birds,
   maternally derived hormones are known to influence a variety of
   morphological, physiological and behavioural traits in the chick. So
   far, the range of these hormonal effects involves benefits in terms of
   enhanced growth and competitive ability as well as costs in terms of
   immunosuppression. However, since yolk hormones can enhance growth and
   begging activity, high levels of these hormones may also involve
   energetic costs. Here, we show experimentally that elevated levels of
   prenatal testosterone increase resting metabolic rate in nestling zebra
   finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Surprisingly, however, elevation of
   prenatal testosterone did not result in higher growth rates and, thus,
   differences in resting metabolism do not seem to be linked to nestling
   growth. We conclude that apart from immunosuppressive effects, high
   levels of egg steroids may also entail costs in terms of increased
   energy expenditure.}},

Abstract = {{Greater offspring predation favors evolution of faster development among

   selection on mothers to increase levels of anabolic androgens in egg
   yolks to achieve faster development. Here, we tested whether (1)
   concentrations of yolk androgens in passerine species were associated
   with offspring predation and (2) embryo and nestling development rates
   were associated with yolk androgen concentrations. We examined three
   androgens that increase in potency along the synthesis pathway:
   androstenedione (A(4)) to testosterone (T) to 5
   alpha-dihydrotestosterone (5 alpha-DHT). Concentrations of none of these
   steroids were related to clutch size; only A, was allometrically related
   to egg volume. Species that experience greater predation showed higher
   yolk concentrations of T and 5 alpha-DHT. Higher concentrations of T and
   particularly 5 alpha-DHT were strongly correlated with faster
   development during the embryo period and less so during the nestling
   period. Development rates were most strongly correlated with 5
   alpha-DHT, suggesting that potency increases along the androgen
   synthesis pathway and that effects are mediated by the androgen receptor
   pathway. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that selection
   for faster development by time-dependent offspring mortality may be
   achieved epigenetically by varying embryo exposure to maternal anabolic

Abstract = {{Sexual dimorphism in size (sexual size dimorphism; SSD) is nearly
   ubiquitous, but the relative importance of genetic versus environmental
   control of SSD is not known for most species. We investigated proximate
   determinants of SSD in several species of squamate reptiles, including
   three species of Sceloporus lizards and the diamond-backed rattlesnake
   (Crotalus atrox). In natural populations of these species, SSD is caused
   by sexual differences in age-specific growth. Males and females,
   however, may often share similar potentials for growth: growth is
   strongly responsive to the availability of food, and sexual differences
   in growth can be greatly suppressed or completely absent under common
   environmental conditions in the laboratory. Sexually divergent growth is
   expressed in natural environments because of inherent ecological
   differences between males and females and because of potential
   epigenetic effects of sex-specific growth regulators. In field-active
   Sceloporus, sexual differences in growth rate are associated with sexual
   divergence in plasma testosterone. Experiments confirm that testosterone
   inhibits growth in species in which females are larger (for example, S.
   undulatus and S. virgatus) and stimulates growth in those in which males
   are larger (for example, S. jarrovii). Interestingly, however, sexual
   divergence in plasma testosterone is not accompanied by divergence in
   growth in S. jarrovii or in male-larger C. atrox in the laboratory.
   Furthermore, experimental effects of castration and testosterone
   replacement on growth are not evident in captive S. jarrovii, possibly
   because growth effects of testosterone are superseded by an abundant,
   high-quality diet. In female-larger S. undulatus, growth may be
   traded-off against testosterone-induced reproductive costs of activity.
   In male-larger species, costs of reproduction in terms of growth are
   suggested by supplemental feeding of reproductive female C. atrox in
   their natural environment and by experimental manipulation of
   reproductive cost in female S. jarrovii. Growth costs of reproduction,
   however, do not contribute substantially to the development of SSD in
   male-larger S. jarrovii. We conclude that the energetic costs of
   testosterone-induced, male reproductive behavior may contribute
   substantially to the development of SSD in some female-larger species.
   However, despite strong evidence that reproductive investment exacts a
   substantial cost in growth, we do not support the reproductive cost
   hypothesis as a general explanation of SSD in male-larger species.}},

Abstract = {{Early sibling aggression is a widespread phenomenon in birds.
   Ornithologists distinguish species with ``obligate{''} and
   ``facultative{''} siblicide. Sibling aggression was described in some
   mammal species: the domestic pig (Sits scrofa), the spotted hyena
   (Crocuta crocuta), the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), and the Iberian lynx
   (L. pardinus). In all of them, sibling aggression corresponds well with
   the ``facultative{''} siblicide model in birds. Sibling aggression was
   observed at the age of 36-64 days in both lynx species. It is usually
   restricted to a single fight and can change the hierarchical structure
   and growth rate of the kittens. In the spotted hyena and the domestic
   pig, the frequency and intensity of aggressive interactions between
   siblings are strongest during the first days of postnatal ontogeny and
   then decrease gradually. The newborns of these species are much
   developed than newborn lynx kittens. Usually adult lynx females, in
   contrast to hyenas and pigs, try to stop sibling fights. This is
   probably related to the larger parental investment at the time of the
   fight in lynxes (a kitten's body weight is about 10\% of the mother's)
   than in pigs (0.5\%) and hyenas (1.9\%). Sibling aggression in spotted
   hyenas could be related to the high level of androstenedione and is not
   related to testosterone concentration. In the Eurasian lynx, female sibs
   attack their littermates slightly more often than male sibs do, and
   sibling aggression is not testosterone-dependent. Hormones secreted by
   the adrenal glands may play an important role in this phenomenon. The
   data available so far, however, do not positively confirm the presence
   of hormonal trigger effects in mammal sibling aggression.}},

Abstract = {{There is accumulating evidence that maternal hormones may play a role in
   offspring sex adjustment, but little is known about the costs of such
   hormone-mediated mechanisms. Recent studies have reported sex-specific
   effects of hormones on offspring viability. Specifically, we previously
   found that elevating the plasma androgen level in mothers results in a
   male-biased offspring primary sex ratio, but it affects the viability of
   sons negatively and daughters positively in zebra finches (Taeniopygia
   guttata; Rutkowska and Cichon, Anim Behav, 71:1283-1288, 2006). In this
   study, we studied further fitness consequences of exposure to elevated
   yolk androgen levels in zebra finches. We measured growth rate and
   cellular immune response of nestlings that hatched from eggs laid by
   females injected with testosterone during egg laying and nestlings of
   unaffected control females. We found that sons of testosterone-treated
   females grew slower in comparison to sons of control females. The
   significant interaction between experimental group and offspring sex
   indicates that sons of testosterone-treated mothers suffered impaired
   immune responsiveness while daughters seemed to benefit from elevated
   androgen level in terms of enhanced immune responsiveness. We found no
   effects of androgens on offspring performance at adulthood-neither
   fecundity of females nor attractiveness of males was affected. We
   conclude that the benefits of biasing sex ratio towards males by
   increasing androgen level in the yolk may be limited due to negative
   effects on male offspring performance early in life.}},

   relative to females paired with unattractive males. We experimentally
   tested this hypothesis in the peafowl (Pavo cristatus) by providing

   with the differential allocation hypothesis, females paired with more

   These results show that the association between paternal phenotype and

   lower amounts of androgens and antibodies into eggs of induced

Abstract = {{Although interspecific variation in maternal effects via testosterone
   levels can be mediated by natural selection, little is known about the
   evolutionary consequences of egg testosterone for sexual selection.
   However, two nonexclusive evolutionary hypotheses predict an
   interspecific relationship between egg testosterone levels and the
   elaboration of sexual traits. First, maternal investment may be
   particularly enhanced in sexually selected species, which should
   generate a positive relationship. Secondly, high prenatal testosterone
   levels may constrain the development of sexual characters, which should
   result in a negative relationship. Here we investigated these hypotheses
   by exploring the relationship between yolk testosterone levels and
   features of song in a phylogenetic study of 36 passerine species. We
   found that song duration and syllable repertoire size were significantly
   negatively related to testosterone levels in the egg, even if
   potentially confounding factors were held constant. These relationships
   imply that high testosterone levels during early development of songs
   may be detrimental, thus supporting the developmental constraints
   hypothesis. By contrast, we found significant evidence that song-post
   exposure relative to the height of the vegetation is positively related
   to egg testosterone levels. These results support the hypothesis that
   high levels of maternal testosterone have evolved in species with
   intense sexual selection acting on the location of song-posts. We found
   nonsignificant effects for intersong interval and song type repertoire
   size, which may suggest that none of the above hypothesis apply to these
   traits, or they act simultaneously and have opposing effects.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal hormones in the yolk of birds' eggs have been a focus of
   attention in behavioral and evolutionary ecology stimulated by the
   pioneering work of Hubert Schwabl. Since then, knowledge of both the
   factors that influence maternal deposition patterns and their
   consequences for offspring development has accumulated rapidly. To date,
   the field has been dominated by the idea that mothers use yolk hormones
   to adaptively adjust offspring development, a view that assigns control
   over hormone deposition and its effects on the offspring to the mother.
   This neglects the possibility that the evolutionary interests of the
   mother and offspring differ. When there is such parent-offspring
   conflict, the offspring are selected to respond to the hormones in a way
   that is adaptive for themselves rather than for the mother. Moreover,
   sexual conflict between the parents over parental investment may shape
   the evolution of yolk hormone deposition: females may manipulate the
   male's contribution to parental care through the effect of yolk hormones
   on offspring begging, competitiveness, and developmental rate. We
   therefore suggest that for a full understanding of the evolution of
   hormone-mediated maternal effects, it is essential to study both fitness
   consequences and physiological mechanisms and constraints from the
   perspective of all family members.}},

   Because in many bird species prospects of the offspring change
   seasonally and with brood number, strategic adjustment of yolk androgen
   levels would be expected. To test this idea, we induced pied flycatcher
   (Ficedula hypoleuca) females to nest twice during the same season by
   removing their first clutches shortly after clutch completion. We
   collected eggs of first and replacement clutches to measure yolk
   concentrations of androstenedione (A4) and testosterone (T) and captured
   the females that laid these clutches for phenotypic measurements.
   Although average egg androgen levels were remarkably consistent within
   females, hormone patterns differed considerably between first and
   replacement clutches. Eggs of replacement clutches were heavier with
   larger yolks compared to first clutches, but they contained on average
   lower levels of androgens. Within clutches, androgen concentration
   increased over the laying sequence in the first clutch, but decreased or
   remained more constant over the laying sequence in the replacement
   clutch. Mean yolk T, but not A4 levels, were negatively associated with
   laying date for both breeding attempts. Moreover, females in good body
   condition produced eggs containing lower levels of androgens than
   females in poor condition. Our results are consistent with the idea that
   differences in yolk androgen levels may be one mechanism underlying
   seasonal variation in reproductive success and it is possible that
   changes in egg androgen patterns may reflect a change in female
   reproductive strategy. High within-female consistency also highlights
   the possibility that there may be some underlying genetic variation in
   yolk androgen levels.}},

Abstract = {{Life-history traits such as offspring size, number and sex ratio are
   affected by maternal feeding rates in many kinds of animals, but the
   consequences of variation in maternal diet quality (rather than
   quantity) are poorly understood. We manipulated dietary quality of
   reproducing female lizards (Amphibolurus muricatus; Agamidae), a species
   with temperature-dependent sex determination, to examine strategies of
   reproductive allocation. Females maintained on a poor-quality diet
   produced fewer clutches but massively (twofold) larger eggs with lower
   concentrations of yolk testosterone than did conspecific females given a
   high-quality diet. Although all eggs were incubated at the same
   temperature, and yolk steroid hormone levels were not correlated with
   offspring sex, the nutrient-deprived females produced highly male-biased
   sex ratios among their offspring. These responses to maternal nutrition
   generate a link between sex and offspring size, in a direction likely to
   enhance maternal fitness if large body size enhances reproductive
   success more in sons than in daughters (as seems plausible, given the
   mating system of this species). Overall, our results showthat sex
   determination in these animals is more complex, and responsive to a
   wider range of environmental cues, than that suggested by the
   classification of `environmental sex determination'.}},

Abstract = {{Birds may influence the fitness of their offspring by transmission of
   different amounts of carotenoids to their eggs. Carotenoids play crucial
   roles in antioxidant protection and immune defence mechanisms, but they
   may be available to females in limiting amounts. Therefore, their
   allocation to the eggs may be influenced by the female's condition, age
   and environmental circumstances. Furthermore, the quality of the male
   parent, which affects the reproductive value of the offspring, may also
   influence this investment. In this correlational study, we investigated
   proximate and ultimate factors that may lead to variation in yolk
   lutein, zeaxanthin and beta-carotene concentrations among and within
   clutches of a wild passerine, the collared flycatcher (Ficedula
   albicollis). We found that carotenoid concentration was positively
   associated with caterpillar supply at the time of egg formation, which
   suggests a proximate constraint of carotenoid availability on yolk
   composition. Neither female condition, body size, age, nor male plumage
   ornamentation, age and body size correlated with carotenoid deposition.
   Yolk beta-carotene concentration was found to be positively linked to
   yolk testosterone concentration. We suggest that females allocated more
   beta-carotene to their eggs to mitigate the potentially detrimental
   effects of elevated steroid concentration. We found that concentration
   of beta-carotene increased with laying order. The possible function of
   this pattern may be to enhance the resistance to oxidative stress and
   pathogens of the disadvantaged last-hatching nestling, suggesting that
   collared flycatchers pursue a compensatory, ``brood survival{''}
   strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal effects occur when offspring phenotype is affected by
   environmental factors experienced by the mother and, in egg-laying
   species, are often mediated via egg resources. There is currently great
   interest among behavioural ecologists in maternally allocated yolk
   androgens, especially their relationship with offspring sex and
   development. Such studies need embryonic tissue for sexing, however,
   requiring eggs to be incubated (usually for 3 days). Therefore, there
   are concerns about whether the androgen concentrations assayed reflect
   those allocated by the mother. In addition, studies showing sex biases
   in maternal allocation of androgens could be confounded if male and
   female embryos uptake or metabolise androgens at different rates. We ran
   a series of experiments using zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) eggs to
   address these potential confounding factors. First we showed, using eggs
   naturally incubated for up to 5 days, that eggs containing embryos had
   lower yolk androgen concentrations than eggs that had failed to form
   embryos. We then tested various hypotheses for this difference using
   controlled incubation treatments. Our results suggested that (a) embryo
   development causes the yolk to become progressively more diluted with
   albumin; and (b) between 3 and 5 days of incubation embryos start
   uptaking or metabolising androgens. Crucially, we found no decline in
   yolk androgen concentration at 3 days incubation, and no evidence for
   sex-specific rates of uptake or metabolism of androgens. This strongly
   suggests that yolk androgen levels up to 3 days incubation do reflect
   those allocated by the mother, and that studies of sex biased maternal
   allocation of yolk androgens are not confounded by sex differences in
   embryo development. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal hormones in vertebrate eggs can mediate important forms of
   maternal effects. However, the function of hormone transfer to the eggs
   is still debated, especially because long-term fitness consequences have
   been little studied. We investigated the effect of prenatal exposure to
   physiologically elevated yolk testosterone (T) levels on reproduction of
   female pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) in captivity. We found that
   females hatching from T-injected eggs (T-females) had a lower egg-laying
   rate than controls, and their eggs were more frequently infertile than
   those laid by control females. There were no effects of prenatal
   maternal treatment on egg size and yolk T concentration, but eggs
   carrying a female embryo laid by T-females had smaller yolks than eggs
   with a male embryo, while there was no sex difference in yolk size among
   the eggs laid by control females. Progeny sex ratio was unaffected by
   maternal treatment. These findings suggest that the transfer of high
   androgen levels to the eggs by the mother is constrained by complex
   trade-offs between direct effects on her daughters' reproduction and by
   trans-generational differential consequences on male and female

Abstract = {{The decision of how far to disperse from the natal territory has
   profound and long-lasting consequences for young animals, yet the
   optimal dispersal behavior often depends on environmental factors that
   are difficult or impossible to assess by inexperienced juveniles.
   Natural selection thus favors mechanisms that allow the adaptive and
   flexible adjustment of the offspring's dispersal behavior by their
   parents via either paternal or maternal effects. Here we show that
   different dispersal strategies maximize the reproductive success of
   young great tits (Parus major) originating from a parasite-infested or a
   parasite-free nest and demonstrate that differential transfer of
   maternal yolk androgens in response to parasitism can result in a
   modification of the offspring's dispersal behavior that appears
   adaptive. It demonstrates that prenatal maternal effects are an
   important yet so far neglected determinant of natal dispersal and
   highlights the potential importance of maternal effects in mediating
   coevolutionary processes in host-parasite systems.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that avian growth and development covary
   with juvenile mortality. Juveniles of birds under strong nest predation
   pressure grow rapidly, have short incubation and nestling periods, and
   leave the nest at low body mass. Life-history theory predicts that
   parental investment increases with adult mortality rate. Thus,
   developmental traits that depend on the parental effort exerted (pre-
   and postnatal growth rate) should scale positively with adult mortality,
   in contrast to those that do not have a direct relationship with
   parental investment (timing of developmental events, e.g. nest leaving).
   I tested this prediction on a sample of 84 North American songbirds.
   Nestling growth rate scaled positively and incubation period duration
   negatively with annual adult mortality rates even when controlled for
   nest predation and other covariates, including phylogeny. On the
   contrary, neither the duration of the nestling period nor body mass at
   fledging showed any relationship. Proximate mechanisms generating the
   relationship of pre- and postnatal growth rates to adult mortality may
   include increased feeding, nest attentiveness during incubation and/or
   allocation of hormones, and deserve further attention.}},

Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{31}},

Pages = {{498-515}},
Abstract = {{A central dogma for the evolution of brain size posits that the
   maintenance of large brains incurs developmental costs, because they
   need prolonged periods to grow during the early ontogeny. Such
   constraints are supported by the interspecific relationship between
   ontological differences and relative brain size in birds and mammals.
   Given that mothers can strongly influence the development of the
   offspring via maternal effects that potentially involve substances
   essential for growing brains, we argue that such effects may represent
   an important but overlooked component of developmental constraints on
   brain size. To demonstrate the importance of maternal effect on the
   evolution of brains, we investigated the interspecific relationship
   between relative brain size and maternal effects, as reflected by yolk
   testosterone, carotenoids, and vitamins A and E in a phylogenetic study
   of birds. Females of species with relatively large brains invested more
   in eggs in terms of testosterone and vitamin E than females of species
   with small brains. The effects of carotenoid and vitamin A levels on the
   evolution of relative brain size were weaker and non-significant. The
   association between relative brain size and yolk testosterone was
   curvilinear, suggesting that very high testosterone levels can be
   suppressive. However, at least in moderate physiological ranges, the
   positive relationship between components of maternal effects and
   relative brain size may imply one aspect of developmental costs of large
   brains. The relationship between vitamin E and relative brain size was
   weakened when we controlled for developmental mode, and thus the effect
   of this antioxidant may be indirect. Testosterone-enhanced neurogenesis
   and vitamin Emediated defence against oxidative stress may have key
   functions when the brain of the embryo develops, with evolutionary
   consequences for relative brain size. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{How much effort to expend in any one bout of reproduction is among the
   most important decisions made by an individual that breeds more than
   once. According to life-history theory, reproduction is costly, and
   individuals that invest too much in a given reproductive bout pay with
   reduced reproductive output in the future. Likewise, investing , too
   little does not maximize reproductive potential. Because reproductive
   effort relative to output can vary with predictable and unpredictable
   challenges and opportunities, no single level of reproductive effort
   maximizes fitness. This leads to the prediction that individuals
   possessing behavioural mechanisms to buffer challenges and take
   advantage of opportunities would incur fitness benefits. Here, we review
   evidence in birds, primarily of altricial species, for the presence of
   at least two such mechanisms and evidence for and against the seasonal
   coordination of these mechanisms through seasonal changes in plasma
   concentrations of the pituitary hormone prolactin. First, the seasonal
   decline in clutch size of most bird species may partially offset a
   predictable seasonal decline in the reproductive value of offspring.
   Second, establishing a developmental sibling-hierarchy among offspring
   may), hedge against unpredictable changes in resource availability and
   offspring viability or quality, and minimize energy), expenditure in
   raising a brood. The hierarchy may be a product, in part, of the timing
   of incubation onset relative to clutch completion and the rate of yolk
   androgen deposition during the laying cycle. Because clutch size should
   influence the effects of both these traits on the developmental
   hierarchy, we predicted and describe evidence in some species that
   females adjust the timing of incubation onset and rate of yolk androuen
   deposition to match clutch size. Studies on domesticated precocial
   species reveal an inhibitory effect of the pituitary hormone prolactin
   on egg layin 9, suggesting a possible hormonal basis for the regulation
   of clutch size. Studies on the American kestrel (Falco sparverius) and
   other species suggest that the seasonal increase in plasma
   concentrations of prolactin may regulate both a seasonal advance in the
   timing of incubation onset and a seasonal increase in the rate of yolk
   androgen deposition. These observations, together with strong conceptual
   arguments published previously, raise the possibility that a single
   hormone, prolactin, functions as the basis of a common mechanism for the
   seasonal adjustment of reproductive effort. However, a role for
   prolactin in regulating, clutch size in any species is not firmly
   established, and evidence from some species indicates that clutch size
   may not be coupled to the timing of incubation onset and rate of yolk
   androgen deposition. A dissociation between the regulation of clutch
   size and the regulation of incubation onset and yolk androgen deposition
   may enable an independent response to the predictable and unpredictable
   challenges and opportunities faced during reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Duration of developmental stages in animals evolves under contrasting
   selection pressures of age-specific mortality and growth requirements.
   When relative importance of these effects varies across environments,
   evolution of developmental periods is expected to be slow. In birds,
   maternal effects on egg-laying order and offspring growth, two proximate
   determinants of nestling period, should enable rapid adjustment of
   developmental periods to even widely fluctuating mortality rates. We
   test this hypothesis in a population of house finches (Carpodacus
   mexicanus) breeding under two contrasting mortality risks: (i) a nest
   mite-free condition when selection on offspring survival favors a longer
   time in the nest; and (it) a mite infestation when selection favors a
   shorter nest tenure. Mites affected survival of sons more than
   daughters, and females breeding under mite infestation laid male eggs
   last and female eggs first in the clutch, thereby reducing sons'
   exposure to mites and associated mortality. Strong sex bias in laying
   order and growth patterns enabled mite-infested offspring to achieve
   similar fledging size, despite a shorter nest tenure, compared with
   mite-free conditions. In mite-infested nests, male nestlings hatched at
   larger sizes, completed growth earlier, and had faster initial growth
   compared with mite-free nests, whereas mite-infested females grew more
   slowly but for a longer period of time. A combination of heavily
   sex-biased laying order and sex differences in growth patterns lowered
   mite-induced mortality by > 10\% in both sexes. Thus, strong maternal
   effects can account for frequently observed, but theoretically
   unexpected, concordance of mortality risks and growth patterns,
   especially under fluctuating ecological conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal hormones may represent an important pathway by which mothers
   can adaptively adjust offspring traits and performance to suit the
   prevailing enviromnental conditions. Earlier studies of birds have shown
   that egg androgens of maternal origin may enhance post-natal offspring
   `begging' displays, functioning to solicit parental care. Here we
   investigate the effects of elevated egg androgen levels on the prenatal
   begging behavior of yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) chicks. At
   laying, we experimentally increased the concentration of yolk
   testosterone (T) within the natural range of variation, and, shortly
   before hatching, we compared the structural properties, rate, and
   loudness of vocalizations of embryos developing in T- and oil-injected
   (control) eggs. In addition, we compared the early post-hatch begging
   rate (measured as the pecking rate towards a dummy gull head) in chicks
   of the two experimental groups. We found that T embryos produced louder
   embryonic vocalizations than controls, whereas structural properties and
   the calling rate did not differ between T and control embryos. The
   post-hatch begging rate was unaffected by T treatment, but strongly
   decreased with increasing chick body mass, suggesting that intensity of
   the begging display was sensitive to chick state and may therefore
   reliably indicate the need of food in this species. Therefore, the
   results of this study show for the first time that prenatal T exposure
   modulates the quality of embryonic vocalizations, but are not in
   accordance with previous findings reporting increased post-hatching
   begging intensity following increased prenatal exposure to androgens.

Abstract = {{The deposition of androgens into the yolks of eggs can have long-lasting

   allocation of more resources to offspring sired by more attractive,
   higher-quality males. We examined deposition patterns of yolk androgens
   in relation to mate attractiveness in the house finch Carpodacus

Abstract = {{Overlap in growth of offspring should constrain the opportunity for
   sex-biased maternal effects, yet sex-specific allocation of maternal
   resources among simultaneously growing ova is often observed in
   vertebrates. in birds, such allocation can be accomplished either by
   temporal clustering of ova that become the same sex, resulting in
   sex-biased egg-laying order, or by follicle-specific delivery of
   maternal resources. Two house finch populations at the northern and
   southern boundaries of the species range have opposite ovulation
   sequences of male and female eggs, and thus, in the absence of sex
   differences in ova growth or sex-specific maternal strategies, would be
   expected to have opposite sex-specific accumulation of maternal
   products. We found that the populations had strong and similar gradients
   of steroid distribution in relation to ovulation order, whereas
   distribution of carotenoids and vitamins correlated with each follicle's
   accumulation of steroids. In both populations, temporal bias in
   production of sons and daughters within a clutch enabled strongly
   sex-specific acquisition of maternal products, and oocytes of the same
   sex were highly interdependent in their accumulation of steroids.
   Moreover, in nests where the sex-bias in relation to ovulation order
   deviated from population-specific patterns, eggs had highly distinct
   concentrations of steroids, carotenoids and vitamins. These results and
   previous findings of sex-specific yolk partitioning among oocytes
   suggest that oocytes that become males and females are temporally or
   spatially clustered during their ovarian growth. We discuss the
   implication of these findings for the evolution of sex-specific maternal
   resource allocation.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated in the black-headed gull whether female deposition of
   antioxidants and immunoglobulins (enhancing early immune function), and
   testosterone (suppressing immune function and increasing early
   competitive skills) correlate suggesting that evolution has favoured the
   mutual adjustment of different pathways for maternal effects. We also
   took egg mass, the position of the egg in the laying sequence and
   offspring sex into account, as these affect offspring survival. Yolk
   antioxidant and immunoglobulin concentrations decreased across the
   laying order, while yolk testosterone concentrations increased. This may
   substantially handicap the immune defence of last-hatched chicks. The
   decrease in antioxidant levels was greater when mothers had a low body
   mass and when the increase in testosterone concentrations was relatively
   large. This suggests that female black-headed gulls are constrained in
   the deposition of antioxidants in last-laid eggs and compensate for this
   by enhanced testosterone deposition. The latter may be adaptive since it
   re-allocates the chick's investment from costly immune function to
   growth and competitive skills, necessary to overcome the consequences of
   hatching late from an egg of reduced quality.}},

Abstract = {{Female birds have repeatedly been reported to adjust the primary sex
   ratio of their offspring to environmental, social and physiological
   cues. However, the mechanism behind sex adjustment remains unknown. It
   has been suggested that maternal hormones may constitute an important
   mediator in this mechanism, as androgen levels differ between eggs
   bearing male and female embryos. To evaluate whether the level of
   maternal androgens affects the offspring sex ratio, we injected female
   zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, with testosterone during egg laying.
   The sex ratio of eggs laid after testosterone administration became
   significantly male biased, compared to eggs laid by control females that
   received a vehicle injection. However, sons of testosterone-treated
   females suffered lower hatching success. In contrast, daughters seemed
   to benefit from elevated androgen level in terms of future survival
   prospects. The opposite effects on male and female offspring may
   constitute an important constraint on maternal androgen allocation to
   the eggs and reduce the benefits of biasing the sex ratio towards males
   by increasing the testosterone level. (c) 2006 The Association for the

Abstract = {{1. Female birds deposit variable amounts of androgens in the yolks of
   their eggs, and it has been suggested that yolk androgen deposition is
   an adaptive mechanism preparing offspring for a competitive environment.
   Breeding pairs of Eastern Bluebirds (Sialia sialis) Linnaeus were
   stimulated with an intruder presentation while ovarian follicles were
   developing. Yolk steroid concentrations in eggs laid by stimulated
   females were then compared with yolk steroid concentrations in eggs laid
   by control females. Additionally, blood samples taken from a subset of
   control and stimulated females were analysed for plasma steroid hormone
   concentrations. We predicted that female bluebirds experiencing a
   simulated intrusion would experience increased levels of circulating
   plasma androgens that would be reflected by larger amounts of androgens
   deposited in their eggs compared with control females.
   2. Patterns of steroid concentrations differed between egg yolks and
   female plasma. In egg yolks, androstenedione was the predominant
   hormone, followed by testosterone. Yolks contained minimal amounts of
   both corticosterone and oestradiol. In female plasma, however,
   corticosterone was the predominant hormone, while sex steroids were
   found at low levels.
   3. Yolk steroid concentrations did not vary with laying order in either
   the control or the stimulated group, a result expected due to the
   relatively synchronous nature of incubation behaviour exhibited by
   Eastern Bluebird females.
   4. Yolk androgen concentrations in eggs laid by stimulated females were
   significantly higher than in those laid by control females, suggesting
   that females increase yolk androgen deposition in response to aggressive
   encounters.
   5. Females exposed to an intruder presentation contained significantly
   lower levels of plasma androgens than control females. We suggest that
   the deposition of androgens in the eggs serves as an adaptive method of
   regulating circulating androgen levels in the female, preventing
   potentially disruptive elevations in circulating androgen concentrations
   during a particularly sensitive period in the reproductive cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Female birds deposit in the yolks of eggs substantial amounts of
   androgens, such as testosterone and androstenedione. These androgens
   have been shown to speed up nestling development, induce a fast
   development of ornaments and increase dominance in adults. Experiments
   in several species have reported that females invest greater amounts of
   androgens in the eggs fathered by attractive males, suggesting that yolk
   androgen is a costly investment for either the offspring or the mother.
   There is some evidence that nestling immunocompetence may be partially
   suppressed by high levels of yolk androgens, but it is not known whether
   this is also the case for females. We tested this hypothesis in the
   house martin by inducing an immune challenge through an injection of
   sheep red blood cells, a standard challenge of the humoral immune
   system. Experimental birds laid eggs with lower amounts of yolk
   androstenedione than controls, and there was a similar non-significant
   trend for testosterone. Furthermore, the probability of laying a
   replacement clutch was higher for birds that had laid a first clutch
   with relatively high levels of yolk testosterone. These results suggest
   that yolk androgen deposition is limited by immune costs in the female,
   and that only females in good condition may afford to invest high levels
   of androgen in eggs in this species.}},

Abstract = {{Previously, we found that experimentally elevated plasma corticosterone
   was transferred to egg yolk by female Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix
   japonica), and that the chicks hatched from these eggs grew more slowly
   than controls and had higher responsiveness of the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis as adults. Here, we tested
   whether exposure to high yolk corticosterone was responsible for the
   slowed growth and elevated HPA responsiveness by manipulating the
   steroid content of eggs directly. Eggs were injected prior to incubation
   with a dose of corticosterone calculated to increase total yolk
   corticosterone concentration by two standard deviations. We found that
   elevated yolk corticosterone slowed growth in male but not female chicks
   and decreased the HPA responsiveness of female but not male adults, in
   contrast to the results of elevated corticosterone in laying females.
   Our results are consistent with others that demonstrate sex differences
   in the organizational effects of glucocorticoids. The mechanisms and
   adaptive value of such differences have yet to be determined. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Mothers can influence the phenotype of their offspring by adjusting the
   quality of their eggs in relation to sex and reproductive value Of the
   progeny. Maternal androgens in the eggs of vertebrates may mediate such
   adaptive early maternal effects. However, the evolution of early
   maternal effects mediated by egg androgens may be constrained by the
   inability of mothers to differentially allocate androgens to eggs with a
   male or a female if androgens have different effects on sons and
   daughters. In this study, we increased the concentration of androgens in
   the eggs of barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) within the physiological
   range of variation and analyzed the effect on nestling growth and
   begging behavior Egg androgens increased body size and mass of sons but
   reduced these characters in daughters when compared to two control
   groups in a repeated-measures analysis of variance of data collected at
   different ages. However, the differential effect of androgen on the two
   sexes was no longer significant when the analysis was restricted to the
   age of 12 days, when final body size is attained. In a second
   experiment, we tested whether mothers differentially allocated androgens
   to eggs with sons rather than daughters while manipulating a paternal
   secondary sexual character. Androgen concentration did not vary in
   relation to paternal ornamentation or embryo sex. Hence, antagonistic
   effects of egg androgens on sons and daughters may exist in the very
   early posthatching life and may constrain the evolution of adaptive
   maternal effects because mothers do not differentially allocate
   androgens in relation to embryo sex.}},

Abstract = {{Shape variation is widespread in nature and embodies both a response to
   and a source for evolution and natural selection. To detect patterns of
   shape evolution, one must assess the quantitative genetic underpinnings
   of shape variation as well as the selective environment that the
   organisms have experienced. Here we used geometric morphometrics to
   assess variation in plastron shell shape in 1314 neonatal slider turtles
   (Trachemys scripta) from 162 clutches of laboratory-incubated eggs from
   two nesting areas. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated that
   nesting area has a limited role in describing plastron shape variation
   among clutches, whereas differences between individual clutches were
   highly significant, suggesting a prominent clutch effect. The
   covariation between plastron shape and several possible maternal effect
   variables (yolk hormone levels and egg dimensions) was assessed for a
   subset of clutches and found to be negligible. We subsequently employed
   several recently proposed methods for estimating heritability from shape
   variables, and generalized a univariate approach to accommodate unequal
   sample sizes. Univariate estimates of shape heritability based on
   Procrustes distances yielded large values for both nesting populations
   (h(2) approximate to 0.86), and multivariate estimates of maximal
   additive heritability were also large for both nesting populations
   (h(max)(2) approximate to 0.57). We also estimated the dominant trend in
   heritable shape change for each nesting population and found that the
   direction of shape evolution was not the same for the two sites.
   Therefore, although the magnitude of shape evolution was similar between
   nesting populations, the manner in which plastron shape is evolving is
   not. We conclude that the univariate approach for assessing quantitative
   genetic parameters from geometric morphometric data has limited utility,
   because it is unable to accurately describe how shape is evolving.}},

Abstract = {{Mothers may profoundly affect offspring phenotype and performance by
   adjusting egg components, including steroid hormones. We studied the
   effects of elevated prenatal testosterone (T) exposure in the
   ring-necked pheasant on the expression of a suite of male and female
   traits, including perinatal response to stress, immune response, growth,
   and secondary sexual traits. Prenatal T levels were increased by
   injecting the yolk of unincubated eggs with physiological doses of the
   hormone. Yolk T injection resulted in a reduced length of male tarsal
   spurs, a trait which positively predicts male success in intra- and
   intersexual selection and viability, whereas no direct effect on male
   wattle characteristics or plumage traits of either sex was observed.
   Female spur length was also negatively affected by T, but to a lesser
   extent than in males. In addition, the covariation between male
   secondary sexual traits, which are reliable quality indicators, differed
   between T and control males, suggesting that the manipulation may have
   altered the assessment of overall male quality by other males and
   females. In conclusion, the negative effects of elevated yolk T on spur
   length, a trait which positively predicts male fitness, coupled with the
   lack of effects on growth or other traits in both sexes, provided
   limited evidence for mothers being subjected to a trade-off between
   positive and negative consequences of yolk T deposition on offspring
   traits and suggest that directional selection for reduced yolk T levels

Abstract = {{Yolk androgens affect offspring hatching, begging, growth and survival
   in many bird species. If these effects are sex-specific, yolk androgen
   deposition may constitute a mechanism for differential investment in
   male and female offspring. We tested this hypothesis in zebra finches.
   In this species, females increase yolk-testosterone levels and produce
   male-biased sex ratios when paired to more attractive males. We
   therefore predicted that especially sons benefit from elevated yolk
   androgens. Eggs were injected with testosterone or sesame oil (controls)
   after 2 days of incubation.
   Testosterone had no clear effect on sex-specific embryonic mortality and
   changed the pattern of early nestling mortality independent of offspring
   sex. Testosterone-treated eggs took longer to hatch than control eggs.
   Control males begged significantly longer than females during the first
   days after hatching and grew significantly faster. These sex differences
   were reduced in offspring from testosterone-treated eggs due to
   prolonged begging durations of daughters, enhanced growth of daughters
   and reduced growth of sons. The results show that variation in maternal
   testosterone can play an important role in avian sex allocation due to
   its sex-specific effects on offspring begging and growth.}},

Abstract = {{Androgen hormones of maternal origin contained in the eggs of avian
   species are considered to have positive effects on offspring
   characteristics and performance. However, negative consequences have
   also been reported, suggesting that mothers may experience a trade-off
   between beneficial and detrimental effects of egg androgens to offspring
   fitness. We studied the effects of elevated yolk testosterone (T)
   concentration on survival, development and phenotype of male and female
   yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) chicks by injecting egg yolks
   with physiological doses of the hormone. Elevated yolk T resulted in a
   male-biased post-hatching sex ratio, T-treated clutches producing a
   greater proportion of males compared to control ones at day 4
   post-hatching, likely resulting from a reduction of female embryonic
   survival, whereas no effect of hormone treatment on hatching success or
   short-term chick survival was observed. In addition, T depressed
   post-hatching body mass in both sexes but had no effects on the
   intensity of the cell-mediated immune response or skeletal growth. No
   sex differences in egg characteristics or chick phenotype were detected.
   Time to hatching was not affected by T, but females originating from
   first laid eggs hatched earlier than males of the same laying order,
   independently of hormone treatment. However, the implications of sex
   differences in hatching times are unclear in the study species. Taken
   together, our results suggest that female yellow-legged gulls may be
   constrained in transferring androgens to their eggs by negative
   consequences on the viability of female offspring and growth of chicks
   of the two sexes.}},

   example of differential allocation. Females increased the concentration
   of androgens in their eggs when mated to males with experimentally
   elongated tails. Female phenotypic quality as measured by arrival date

Abstract = {{Recent studies on hormone-mediated maternal effects in birds have
   highlighted the influence of variable maternal yolk androgen
   concentration on offspring phenotype, particularly in terms of early
   development. If genetic differences between laying females regulate
   variation in yolk hormone concentration, then this physiological
   maternal effect is an indirect genetic effect which can provide a basis
   for the co-evolution of maternal and offspring phenotypes. Thus, we
   investigated the evolutionary associations between maternally derived
   yolk testosterone (T) and early developmental traits in passerine birds
   via a comparative, phylogenetic analysis. Our results from
   species-correlation and independent contrasts analyses provide
   convergent evidence for the correlated evolution of maternal yolk T
   concentration and length of the prenatal developmental period in
   passerines. Here, we show these traits are significantly negatively
   associated (species-correlation: p<0.001, r(2) = 0.85; independent
   contrasts: p=0.005). Our results highlight the need for more studies
   investigating the role of yolk hormones in evolutionary processes

Abstract = {{In species where offspring fitness is sex-specifically influenced by
   maternal reproductive condition, sex allocation theory predicts that
   poor-quality mothers should invest in the evolutionarily less expensive
   sex. Despite an accumulation of evidence that mothers can
   sex-specifically modulate investment in offspring in relation to
   maternal quality, few mechanisms have been proposed as to how this is
   achieved. We explored a hormonal mechanism for sex-biased maternal
   investment by measuring and experimentally manipulating baseline levels
   of the stress hormone corticosterone in laying wild female European
   starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and examining effects on sex ratio and
   sex-specific offspring phenotype adjustment. Here we show that baseline
   plasma corticosterone is negatively correlated with energetic body
   condition in laying starlings, and subsequent experimental elevation of
   maternal baseline plasma corticosterone increased yolk corticosterone
   without altering maternal condition or egg quality per se. Hormonal
   elevation resulted in the following: female-biased hatching sex ratios
   (caused by elevated male embryonic mortality), lighter male offspring at
   hatching (which subsequently grew more slowly during postnatal
   development), and lower cell-mediated immune (phytohemagglutinin)
   responses in males compared with control-born males; female offspring
   were unaffected by the manipulation in both years of the study. Elevated
   maternal corticosterone therefore resulted in a sex-biased adjustment of
   offspring quality favorable to female offspring via both a sex ratio
   bias and a modulation of male phenotype at hatching. In birds,
   deposition of yolk corticosterone may benefit mothers by acting as a
   bet-hedging strategy in stochastic environments where the correlation
   between environmental cues at laying (and therefore potentially maternal
   condition) and conditions during chick-rearing might be low and
   unpredictable. Together with recent studies in other vertebrate taxa,
   these results suggest that maternal stress hormones provide a
   mechanistic link between maternal quality and sex-biased maternal
   investment in offspring.}},

Abstract = {{Male song complexity is a sexually selected trait found in many
   songbirds, including strains of the domestic canary. Studies on several
   species have shown that male song can affect the hormonal state of
   females and may also influence concentrations of maternal hormones in
   the yolk of their eggs. In this study, we show that the level of
   circulating androgens and oestrogens of female canaries, as measured in
   faeces, varies with the quality of male song to which they are exposed.
   The female-perceived quality of male canary song depends on the
   production of special `sexy syllables' to which females respond with
   more sexual displays. Using playback of synthetic song we show that
   females hearing songs with sexy syllables have higher levels of faecal
   testosterone than control females hearing songs without them. However,
   unlike previous studies on the canary, we found no evidence that such
   females laid eggs with more testosterone (or other steroids) in their
   egg yolks. We discuss these results in relation to the evolution of male
   signalling and maternal investment strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Organisms frequently encounter stressful ecological conditions. In
   vertebrates, a major mechanism of physiological response to stress is
   mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and results in
   increased secretion of glucocorticosteroids, which can have adverse
   consequences on diverse phenotypic traits affecting fitness. Maternal
   stress may thus have carry-over effects on progeny if it influences
   pre-natal offspring environment in terms of glucocorticosteroid
   concentration, although this hypothesis has never been tested in any
   species under field conditions. We manipulated stress experienced by
   female barn swallows Hirundo rustica, by exposing them to a predator
   during laying and measured egg corticosterone concentration. Stressed
   females laid eggs with greater corticosterone concentration than
   controls exposed to a herbivore. In another experiment, we injected
   physiological doses of corticosterone in the egg albumen and compared
   the phenotype of offspring originating from these eggs with their
   control siblings originating from either sham-inoculated or
   unmanipulated eggs and reared in the same nest. Eggs injected with
   corticosterone had lower hatchability and produced fledglings with
   smaller body size and slower plumage development than did control eggs.
   Nestling body size in our study population predicts long-term survival.
   Thus, maternal stress impaired offspring phenotype and viability by
   increasing transmission of glucocorticosteroids to the eggs. This study
   identifies a novel mechanism mediating early maternal effects whereby
   maternal stress affects offspring quality. These results are relevant to
   biological conservation because they disclose a mechanism that can link
   environmental conditions to population productivity and viability.}},

Abstract = {{1. Maternal yolk hormones can enhance the development and phenotypic
   quality of nestling birds. Nevertheless, within species large
   differences in yolk androgen concentrations among clutches are observed.
   This differential allocation of maternal yolk hormones might be
   explained by a trade-off between beneficial effects of yolk androgens
   and their associated costs.
   2. Potential costs include an increased susceptibility to parasites in
   nestlings exposed to high concentrations of yolk androgens during
   embryonic development, weaker immune response or increased levels of
   circulating corticosterone that indirectly reduce immune function.
   3. In a field study, we manipulated yolk testosterone in great tit
   (Parus major) eggs and tested the nestling's susceptibility to
   ectoparasites as measured by the parasites' effect on growth, the
   cellular immune response, and the levels of circulating corticosterone.
   4. At the end of the nestling period, nestlings originating from
   testosterone-injected eggs were heavier than control nestlings. This
   effect was strongest in nestlings at the end of the size hierarchy, as
   shown by a significant interaction between hormone treatment and the
   nestlings' size rank within nests.
   5. High levels of yolk testosterone promoted growth of the nestling's
   body mass similarly in parasite-infested and parasite-free nests, and
   neither affected the levels of plasma corticosterone, nor the nestling's
   cell-mediated immune response.
   6. In summary, our results do not show negative short-term effects of
   high concentrations of yolk testosterone on immune function or parasite
   susceptibility, but emphasize that maternal investment via deposition of
   yolk testosterone can promote fitness-related growth and development of
   nestlings.}},

Abstract = {{Although factors influencing androgen deposition in the avian egg and
   its effects on nestling fitness are recently receiving considerable
   attention, little is known about the potential costs of high
   testosterone levels in the females. Our study aimed at determining the
   effect of injections of testosterone (T) in female zebra finches
   (Taeniopygia guttata), on clutch size, egg mass, yolk mass, and yolk
   androgen content. Females were given a single bolus injection of T in a
   range of doses after laying the first egg. Results show that
   administration of T negatively affected clutch size; the strength of
   this effect increased with increasing doses of T. Females injected with
   the highest testosterone dose showed suppressed oviposition of the third
   and the fourth eggs. Interestingly, testosterone administration made
   females produce eggs with relatively large yolks, suggesting that T may
   mediate the trade-off between number and size of eggs. Testosterone
   injection resulted in elevated levels of androgen in the eggs, in
   contrast to control clutches, which showed a decreasing pattern of
   androgen concentration along the laying sequence. We conclude that high
   androgen investment in eggs may be limited by physiological requirements
   of the ovulatory process. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Eggs of vertebrates contain steroid hormones of maternal origin that may
   influence offspring performance. Recently, it has been shown that
   glucocorticoids, which are the main hormones mediating the stress
   response in vertebrates, are transmitted from the mother to the egg in
   birds. In addition, mothers with experimentally elevated corticosterone
   levels lay eggs with larger concentrations of the hormone, which produce
   slow growing offspring with high activity of the hypothalamo-adrenal
   axis under acute stress. However, the effects and function of transfer
   of maternal corticosterone to the eggs are largely unknown. In the
   present study, we injected corticosterone in freshly laid eggs of
   yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis), thus increasing the
   concentration of the hormone within its natural range of variation, and
   analyzed the effect of manipulation on behavioral, morphological, and
   immune traits of the offspring in the wild. Eggs injected with
   corticosterone had similar hatching success to controls, but hatched
   later. Mass loss during incubation was greater for
   corticosterone-treated eggs, except for the last laid ones.
   Corticosterone injection reduced rate and loudness of late embryonic
   vocalizations and the intensity of chick begging display. Tonic
   immobility response, reflecting innate fearfulness, was unaffected by
   hormone treatment. Elevated egg corticosterone concentrations depressed
   T-cell-mediated immunity but had no detectable effects on humoral immune
   response to a novel antigen, viability at day 10, or growth. Present
   results suggest that egg corticosterone can affect the behavior and
   immunity of offspring in birds and disclose a mechanism mediating early
   maternal effects whereby stress experienced by females may negatively
   translate to offspring phenotypic quality.}},

Abstract = {{Life-history theory predicts that individuals should increase their
   reproductive effort when the fitness return from reproduction is high.
   Females mated with high-quality males are therefore expected to have
   higher investment than females mated with low-quality males, which could
   bias estimates of paternal effects. Investigating the traits females use
   in their allocation decisions and the aspects of reproduction that are
   altered is essential for understanding how sexual selection is affected.
   We studied the potential for differential female allocation in a captive
   population of a precocial bird, the Chinese quail, Coturnix chinensis.
   Females paired with males with large sexual ornaments laid larger, but
   not more, eggs than females paired with males with small sexual
   ornaments. Furthermore, female egg mass was also significantly
   positively affected by male testis size, probably via some unknown
   effect of testis size on male phenotype. Testis size and ornament size
   were not correlated. Thus, both primary and secondary male sexual traits
   could be important components of female allocation decisions.
   Experimental manipulation of hormone levels during embryonic development
   showed that both male and female traits influencing female egg size were
   sensitive to early hormone exposure. Differences in prenatal hormone
   exposure as a result of maternal steroid allocation to eggs may explain
   some of the variation in reproductive success among individuals, with
   important implications for nongenetic transgenerational effects in
   sexual selection.}},

Abstract = {{The Trivers - Willard hypothesis predicts sex biases in parental
   investment according to parental condition. In addition, parents may
   need to sex bias their investment if there is an asymmetry between the
   sexes in offspring fitness under different conditions. For studying
   maternal differential investment, egg resources are ideal subjects
   because they are self contained and allocated unequivocally by the
   female. Recent studies show that yolk androgens can be beneficial to
   offspring, so here we test for sex-biased investment with maternal
   investment of yolk testosterone ( T) in zebra finch (Taeniopygia
   guttata) eggs. From the Trivers - Willard hypothesis, we predicted
   females to invest more in male eggs in optimum circumstances ( e. g.
   good-condition mother, early-laid egg), and more in female eggs under
   suboptimal conditions ( e. g. poor-condition mother, late-laid egg).
   This latter prediction is also because in this species there is a female
   nestling disadvantage in poor conditions and we expected mothers to help
   compensate for this in female eggs. Indeed, we found more yolk T in
   female than male eggs. Moreover, in accordance with our predictions,
   yolk T in male eggs increased with maternal quality relative to female
   eggs, and decreased with laying order relative to female eggs. This
   supports our predictions for the different needs and value of male and
   female offspring in zebra finches. Our results support the idea that
   females may use yolk androgens as a tool to adaptively manipulate the
   inequalities between different nestlings.}},

Abstract = {{Avian eggs contain substantial amounts of maternal hormones and so
   provide an excellent model to study hormone-mediated maternal effects.
   We review this new and rapidly evolving field, taking an ecological and
   evolutionary approach and focusing on effects and function of maternal
   androgens in offspring development. Manipulation of yolk levels of
   androgens within the physiological range indicates that maternal
   androgens affect behaviour, growth, morphology, immune function and
   survival of the offspring, in some cases even long after fledging.
   Descriptive and experimental studies show systematic variation in
   maternal androgen deposition both within and among clutches, as well as
   in relation to the sex of the embryo. We discuss the potential adaptive
   value of maternal androgen transfer at all these three levels. We
   conclude that maternal androgen deposition in avian eggs provides a
   flexible mechanism of non-genetic inheritance, by which the mother can
   favour some offspring over others, and adjust their developmental
   trajectories to prevailing environmental conditions, producing different
   phenotypes. However, the literature is less consistent than often
   assumed and at all three levels, the functional explanations need
   further experimental testing. The field would greatly benefit from an
   analysis of the underlying physiological mechanisms. (c) 2004 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The differential allocation hypothesis predicts that females invest more
   resources into reproduction when mating with attractive males. In
   oviparous animals this can include prefertilization decisions such as
   the production of larger eggs and the deposition of hormones, such as
   the steroid testosterone, into yolks. On the other hand, a compensatory
   hypothesis posits that females allocate more resources into the eggs
   when mated with males of inferior quality. In the present study, we show
   that free-living females of the collared flycatcher (Ficedula
   albicollis), a small passerine bird, do not produce larger eggs or
   deposit more testosterone into eggs when mating with attractive males
   reflected by a large forehead patch size, which is contrary to the
   prediction of the differential allocation hypothesis. However, we found
   higher yolk testosterone concentrations in eggs laid for young than
   older males. Because in young males genetic quality, parental
   experience, or willingness to invest into paternal care is likely to be
   low, high yolk testosterone level in their clutches may indicate that
   their females follow a compensatory tactic. They may elicit more
   paternal care from young, inexperienced males by hormonally increasing
   nestling begging. Laying date was also correlated with yolk testosterone
   level; however, when we controlled for it, male age still remained a
   strong determinant of testosterone allocation.}},

   decreasing plasma E2 concentrations during laying). We report systematic
   variation in yolk oestrogen concentrations, in relation to laying
   sequence, similar to that widely reported for androgenic steroids. In
   sham-manipulated females, yolk E2 concentrations decreased with laying
   sequence. However, in E2-treated females plasma E2 levels were higher
   during the period of rapid yolk development of later-laid eggs, compared
   with control females. As a consequence, we reversed the
   laying-sequence-specific pattern of yolk E2: in E2-treated females, yolk
   E2 concentrations increased with laying-sequence. In general therefore,
   yolk E2 levels were a direct reflection of plasma E2 levels. However, in
   control females there was some inter-individual variability in the
   endogenous pattern of plasma E2 levels through the laying cycle which
   could generate variation in sequence-specific patterns of yolk hormone
   levels even if these primarily reflect circulating steroid levels.}},

Abstract = {{Females are predicted to adjust their reproductive investment in
   relation to resource quality. In zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata),
   diet quality has been found to influence egg mass both between and
   within clutches. We tested the prediction that diet quality also affects
   the quantity of maternally allocated yolk testosterone and
   5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) between and within clutches. We also
   investigated whether this pattern differed between male and female eggs.
   Females laid eggs on a high-quality (HQ) or a low-quality (LQ) diet.
   Eggs were removed at laying and artificially incubated for 72 h, after
   which time embryos were sexed and yolk androgens assayed. Diet
   treatments were then swapped and the experiment repeated. Because there
   was evidence of a carry-over effect between breeding rounds, we based
   our conclusions mainly on the results from the first breeding round. On
   the HQ diet, but not on the LQ diet, infertile eggs contained more
   testosterone than did fertile eggs in round one. Although there were no
   overall differences in within-clutch patterns of androgen deposition
   between the diets, this changed when embryo sex was taken into account.
   On the HQ diet, testosterone decreased with laying sequence for male
   eggs but increased with laying sequence for female eggs. On the LQ diet,
   mothers' male eggs contained more testosterone and DHT than did female
   eggs regardless of position in the laying sequence. Our data suggest
   that there are complex, context-dependent mechanisms of sex-specific
   androgen allocation in this species.}},

Abstract = {{The last decade has witnessed a surge in studies on steroid hormones of
   maternal origin present in avian eggs and affecting offspring
   development. The value of such studies for the understanding of maternal
   effects and individual differentiation is endorsed and a series of
   methodological and conceptual issues in the current approaches is
   discussed. First to be addressed is the topic of correct sampling of
   eggs or yolk for hormone analyses. Changes in yolk hormone levels during
   the incubation period and the uneven distribution of hormones within the
   egg are discussed. Different ways of calculating hormone levels and the
   importance of collecting data for specific a priori hypotheses are
   explained. Next to be discussed are the pros and cons of different
   techniques for manipulating yolk hormone levels and their proper scaling
   to naturally occurring levels. Third, several issues hampering the
   interpretation of results from descriptive and experimental studies are
   addressed. These concern biased embryonic mortality, clutch size, and
   egg quality that may confound the interpretation of the effect of egg
   position in the laying order, and the possibility of sex-specific
   effects and long-term effects. Also discussed are the probability of
   context-dependent results (due to, e.g., other egg components affecting
   egg quality, parental quality, and environmental factors), the
   difficulty in demonstrating adaptive effects due to individual
   optimization, and the lack of insight in the underlying physiological
   processes. Finally, it is concluded that this field has shown much
   progress but that it would profit from a more careful consideration of
   methodology and from a better integration of behavioral ecology and
   endocrinology.}},

Abstract = {{Avian eggs contain substantial levels of various hormones of maternal
   origin and have recently received a lot of interest, mainly from
   behavioral ecologists. These studies strongly depend on the measurement
   of egg hormone levels, but the method of measuring these levels has
   received little attention. This paper describes the sampling,
   extraction, and assay of hormones in avian eggs and related
   methodological problems. The method of sampling is important because
   hormones are not homogeneously distributed within the egg, and after
   onset of embryonic development their levels may decrease and increase
   due to changes in egg structure and secretion or uptake of hormones by
   the embryo. The extraction of hormones from the yolk and chromatographic
   separation of different hormones for immunoassays can strongly influence
   the results because such procedures remove interfering substances such
   as proteins, lipids, and other hormones and their metabolites, which can
   cross-react with the antiserum used. Finally, the assay itself needs
   more validation than many studies report, especially with respect to the
   accuracy and specificity of the hormone measurements. We conclude that
   the addressed issues need more attention for the correct interpretation
   of differences in hormone levels within and between studies.}},

Abstract = {{We examined variability in yolk hormone levels among songbird species
   and the role of yolk steroids as a mechanism for enhanced exploitation
   of hosts by the parasitic brown-headed cowbird Molothrus ater.
   Within-clutch variation in yolk steroids has been found in several avian
   species in single species studies, but few comparisons have been made
   among species. We found a large range of differences in yolk
   testosterone among the seven passerine species examined, with
   significant differences between those at the high end (song sparrow
   Melospiza melodia, red-winged blackbird Agelaius phoeniceus, and house
   sparrow, Passer domesticus) and those at the low end (eastern phoebe
   Sayornis phoebe, and house finch Carpodacus mexicanus). We also found
   that the testosterone level in cowbird eggs was intermediate in relation
   to host species levels and was significantly lower than that in three
   common cowbird hosts (song sparrow, red-winged blackbird, and house
   sparrow), but not significantly different from three others.
   Geographical comparisons of yolk testosterone levels in all cowbird
   subspecies and populations from several regions showed no significant
   differences, though a trend that deserves further exploration was the
   pattern of lowest level in the ancestral population of cowbirds in the
   central prairies and of highest level in the northwestern population
   where range invasion occurred approximately 40 years ago. The levels of
   17 beta-estradiol were similar in the seven songbird species examined,
   which is consistent with current hypotheses that this hormone plays a
   role in embryonic sexual differentiation. Further investigation is
   needed to determine whether the large differences observed among species
   in absolute level of yolk testosterone are the relevant focal point or
   whether target tissue sensitivity differences mediate the effects of
   this yolk steroid, particularly between parasitic and non-parasitic
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Since egg production is nutritionally and energetically expensive,
   differential allocation theory predicts that females should allocate
   more resources at laying when mated to an attractive male. Females are
   also predicted to invest more in sons than in daughters under such
   conditions, because male offspring should have higher fitness returns
   than female offspring when fathered by an attractive male. We examined
   primary resource allocation in zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, when
   mated to both an attractive and an unattractive male. In the first
   breeding round, as predicted, females mated to attractive males laid
   heavier eggs, and there was a positive relation between female mass and
   egg mass. In contrast, for females mated to unattractive males there was
   no correlation between egg mass and body mass. Mate attractiveness did
   not affect clutch size or yolk androgen investment. Unexpectedly, in the
   second breeding round, in which the same females were paired with
   different males of opposite attractiveness to those in the first round,
   females did not alter their individual patterns of investment in egg
   mass. Therefore, we suggest there may be a physiological carryover
   effect and that females were primed by their first reproductive
   experience. In both rounds of breeding there was no difference in egg
   mass or yolk androgen concentration between male or female eggs in
   either treatment. Similarly, the primary sex ratio did not differ
   between treatments. This suggests that females do not differentially
   invest in male and female offspring in relation to the attractiveness of
   their mate in this species. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Hatching asynchrony in birds produces an age and size hierarchy among
   siblings. Later-hatching chicks have a competitive disadvantage, and
   brood reduction may occur when food availability is insufficient to
   raise all chicks. When early-hatched chicks fail to survive or if the
   circumstances allow raising all chicks, mothers should reverse the
   disadvantage to later-hatched chicks. Increasing deposition of maternal
   androgens with the laying sequence has been suggested to compensate for
   detrimental effects of hatching asynchrony, allowing a more precise
   adjustment of the survival probabilities of each chick. Here, we show
   for black-headed gulls that the increase in yolk testosterone with each
   successive egg is greater when the mother incubates longer before clutch
   completion, which is the major determinant of the degree of hatching
   asynchrony. This finding supports the idea that yolk testosterone has a
   compensatory function in the context of hatching asynchrony. Our data
   further show that if the time needed to complete a clutch is lengthened,
   the developmental differences due to incubation between the first- and
   the last-laid eggs increase. In addition, the onset of incubation before
   clutch completion occurs sooner as the breeding season progresses. Both
   long inter-egg intervals and the seasonal shift in incubation behavior
   enhance the necessity of compensation for later-hatching chicks. Indeed,
   yolk levels of testosterone increased more steeply over the laying
   order, if the duration of the egg-laying period was extended and in
   later-laid clutches. We suggest that prolactin plays a key role in the
   adjustment of testosterone allocation to the incubation pattern.}},

Abstract = {{The relatively small common cuckoo Cuculus canorus hatchling evicts its
   host's propagules, then begs intensively to elicit sufficient parental
   care. The proximate mechanisms of these behaviours are still obscure.
   Recent intraspecific studies on avian broods revealed higher competitive
   ability of nestlings that hatched from eggs with a greater yolk
   testosterone level. Greater maternal investment in yolk steroids may
   provide an explanation for the vigour of parasitic chicks. Unexpectedly
   we found no evidence of higher yolk T concentration and absolute amount
   of T in cuckoo eggs compared to those of its host, the great reed
   warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus. The yolk mass of cuckoo eggs,
   however, was significantly greater than that of the host, despite egg
   volumes being similar between these two species. Relatively larger yolks
   of cuckoo eggs indicates differential maternal investment strategies by
   parasites as more yolk may contain additional macronutrients to increase
   the vigour of parasitic young during the early days of its life and/or
   to enhance its begging display to elicit care from foster parents.}},

   injected a physiological dose of testosterone or vehicle into eggs in
   the field, removed nestlings, and hand-raised them in the laboratory. At
   5 months of age, we investigated treatment effects on plumage and
   behavior. Males that hatched from testosterone-injected eggs developed a
   larger badge than males that hatched from vehicle-injected (control)
   eggs. However, testosterone did not induce the expression of a badge in
   females. In staged dyadic encounters, both males and females hatched
   from testosterone-injected eggs were more successful at obtaining and
   defending a food source than individuals of the same sex hatched from
   control eggs. The results suggest that variable concentrations of
   maternal testosterone in the eggs of the house sparrow organize the
   expression of a plumage trait in males and behavior in both sexes.}},

Abstract = {{1. Optimal egg size theory predicts that females should produce
   propagules of a size and number that maximize maternal fitness. However,
   studies of the allocation of resources to eggs have rarely provided
   evidence of such optimization. This is presumably because of constraints
   that limit reproductive allocation. One such example is that of pelvic
   aperture morphology constraining egg size in turtles.
   2. Growing evidence suggests that even this classic example is
   incomplete. Hormones that regulate both the reproductive cycle and
   vitellogenic activity in turtles may provide a novel physiological
   mechanism for control of egg size.
   3. This physiological constraint hypothesis was explored by examining
   the relationship between maternally derived yolk hormones and egg mass
   in the Painted Turtle (Chrysemys picta, Schneider).
   4. Eggs from younger females contained significantly more testosterone
   in the yolk than did eggs from older females. Younger females laid eggs
   nearly 20\% smaller than those of older females even where body sizes
   overlapped.
   5. Elevated testosterone levels in younger females may thus constrain
   egg size physiologically, beyond the well-known physical constraints
   imposed by pelvic aperture morphology. The endocrine system may play an
   important but previously unrecognized role in the evolution of egg size
   in this model system.}},

Abstract = {{Avian egg yolk contains androgenic hormones, such as testosterone, of
   maternal origin. Experimental elevation of yolk testosterone levels
   enhances growth of canary chicks. Success in sibling competition, due to
   increased begging, is presumed to underlie this growth enhancement,
   because canary hatchlings from testosterone-treated eggs beg longer in
   response to vibrational stimuli than controls. Furthermore, experimental
   elevation of both yolk androstenedione and testosterone increased chick
   growth and begging in black-headed gulls. We measured daily growth of
   European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) chicks hatching from
   testosterone-treated or vehicle-treated (control) eggs until 14 days of
   age, and measured begging behavior at hatching and at 5 days of age. A
   temporary drought caused relatively high levels of early brood reduction
   for this population; 2- and 3-day-old chicks were most likely to starve.
   We found that chicks from testosterone-treated eggs were less likely to
   starve than control chicks, and were heavier on the days when most brood
   reduction occurred. However, chicks from testosterone-treated eggs
   begged less than control chicks on the day of hatching, and begged
   similarly at 5 days of age. Thus, while yolk testosterone did increase
   growth during periods of (presumably) high competition, increased
   begging does not appear to mediate this effect. Instead, testosterone
   may induce more efficient energy use, for example, by decreasing
   ineffective begging. While our results indicate that elevated yolk
   testosterone enhances survival, and thus offspring and parental fitness,
   further evidence regarding the fitness consequences of yolk androgens
   are vital to understanding their role in avian life history. (C) 2004

Abstract = {{Maternal yolk androgens can promote growth and competitive abilities of
   nestling birds but are also suggested to increase susceptibility to
   parasites or suppress immune function. We tested the hypothesis that
   females exposed to ectoparasites during egg formation will adjust the
   content of androgens in the yolk. We predicted that when anticipating
   high levels of parasitism, females deposit (i) less androgens into all
   eggs of their clutch and (ii) smaller amounts of androgens in eggs late
   in the laying sequence to facilitate brood reduction.
   In a field experiment we exposed female great tits (Parus major) to hen
   fleas (Ceratophyllus gallinae), or kept them free of ectoparasites prior
   to egg laying. We collected the eggs and measured yolk concentrations of
   androstenedione (A4), testosterone (T) and 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone
   (DHT) by radioimmunoassay. Among clutches, eggs of ectoparasite-exposed
   females contained significantly less A4 and tended to contain less T,
   whereas DHT content was unaffected. Within clutches, content of A4 and T
   increased significantly with laying order whereas DHT content
   significantly decreased. These patterns were unaffected by
   ectoparasites.
   In summary, our results provide no evidence for hormone-based
   facilitation of brood reduction under ectoparasite exposure but support
   the hypothesis that females exposed to ectoparasites reduce levels of T
   and its precursor A4 in yolk and might thereby reduce the negative
   effects of parasites on offspring.}},

Abstract = {{Theory suggests that maternal effects are especially important in
   organisms with environmentally-sensitive sex-determining mechanisms.
   However, there is no substantive body of empirical evidence to confirm
   this conjecture. We integrated field and laboratory studies to jointly
   evaluate the significance of behavioral (nest-site choice) and
   physiological (yolk hormone allocation) maternal effects on offspring
   sex ratio in the common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina), a species
   with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Of the 16
   microhabitat variables measured, only three (south, east, and total
   overstory vegetation cover) were significantly correlated with nest
   temperature: cooler nests were located under more vegetation cover. In
   turn, these microhabitat predictors of nest temperature, and nest
   temperature itself, may influence nest sex ratio: shadier, cooler nests
   were more likely to produce a higher proportion of male offspring than
   less shady, warmer nests. Analysis of eggs from these same nests
   incubated in a common garden design in the laboratory revealed that
   clutch sex ratio was unaffected by levels of yolk estradiol, yolk
   testosterone, or their interaction. Examination of both behavioral and
   physiological maternal effects revealed no concordant impact on
   offspring sex ratio. However, eggs from nests that produced male-biased
   sex ratios in the field yielded higher proportions of males under
   constant-temperature conditions in the laboratory. Our study confirms
   the importance of behavioral maternal effects in nature on offspring sex
   ratios in species with TSD, while also revealing the potential presence
   of a predisposition for sex-ratio production underlying TSD in this
   system.}},

Abstract = {{It has been suggested that the amount of maternal testosterone allocated
   into the eggs might be implicated in the process of sex determination.
   However, recent findings on the effect that female social rank has on
   the level of egg testosterone suggest that reported associations between
   male-biased sex ratios and yolk testosterone may represent an indirect
   hormonal effect mediated by the interdependence among maternal hormones,
   female social rank, and sex ratio. Here, we report the results of a
   field experiment in which we manipulated the circulating levels of
   testosterone in female spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor) before egg
   formation. Focal females were controlled in subsequent years to explore
   possible delayed effects of hormone manipulation on primary sex ratio
   and social status that could persist because of permanent hormonal
   change or through hormone-dominance interactions. The results indicate
   that testosterone-implanted females (T-females) produced significantly
   more sons than control females (C-females) in the year in which they
   were manipulated. These differences in offspring sex ratio between T-
   and C-females persisted in the next 3 years, although no additional
   hormone treatments were given. These results were not mediated by an
   eventual effect of testosterone treatment on the quality of the females
   mates. A similar proportion of T- and C-females acquired a nest box and
   bred either in the manipulation year or in Year I after manipulation,
   but T-females tended to be more successful in acquiring a nest box than
   C-females in Years 2 and 3 after manipulation. These results suggest
   that added testosterone had a direct role on the acquisition and
   maintenance of high social rank. Delayed effects of testosterone on
   primary sex ratio might have been caused by altered endogenous
   production of T-females. Alternatively, the maintenance of sex ratio
   differences between T- and C-females long after having being implanted
   might be attributed to the positive effect that enhanced social rank of
   T-females has on their circulating testosterone levels. (C) 2004

Abstract = {{Female birds incorporate in the yolks of their eggs significant
   concentrations of a number of different androgens. Yolk androgen has
   been shown to positively affect several fitness components at the
   embryo, nestling and juvenile stages. Previous experiments have shown
   that females lay eggs with higher androgen concentrations when they are
   paired with highly ornamented males. This pattern suggests that yolk
   androgens are costly to females. In this study, we experimentally
   manipulated adult female condition in zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata
   by modifying the level of developmental stress they suffered as
   nestlings. This was achieved by cross-fostering nestlings to broods of
   varying brood size. Subsequently, we measured the yolk testosterone
   contents of the female offspring that resulted from the experimental
   manipulation. As predicted, females deposited decreasing concentrations
   of testosterone with increasing brood sizes experienced as nestlings:
   testosterone concentration (mean +/- S.E.M.) of eggs laid by females
   from small broods, 20.66 +/- 2.08 pg mg(-1); medium broods, 15.32 +/-
   1.94 pg mg(-1); and large broods, 14.51 +/- 1.66 pg mg(-1).
   Additionally, testosterone concentration decreased with laying order,
   and varied with clutch size in a complex way. Differences in egg
   testosterone between females exposed to different brood sizes are in
   line with previous findings in showing that early developmental stress
   can affect adult reproductive performance, although our study did not
   detect an effect in other breeding parameters, such as latency to breed
   or clutch size. Furthermore, the results are consistent with the
   hypothesis that there is a cost associated with yolk testosterone.
   However, it is still unclear what the nature of this cost may be, and
   whether it is paid by females, offspring, or both.}},

Abstract = {{While it is clear that maternal transfer of steroids to egg yolk can
   have significant effects on offspring phenotype, an unresolved question
   is whether females can facultatively adjust yolk hormone levels
   independently of their own plasma levels or whether yolk steroid levels
   are simply a direct consequence of temporal variation in the female's
   hormonal status. In part, this is because we lack detailed information
   about the day-to-day pattern of changes in plasma hormone levels during
   the laying cycle for non-domesticated birds. Here, we describe changes
   in plasma estradiol-17beta (E2) and androgens, throughout laying in
   relation to specific stages of ovarian follicular development in the
   European starling (Sturnus vulgaris). Plasma E2 levels increased rapidly
   from the onset of rapid yolk development (RYD) to reach maximum levels
   in birds with a complete follicle hierarchy ( greater than or equal to 4
   yolky follicles). However, levels decreased linearly throughout the
   later stages of follicle development returning to pre-breeding values
   before the final yolky follicle was ovulated. In females with greater
   than or equal to 4 yolky follicles there was 10-fold variation in plasma
   E2 levels among individual females, but this was not related to plasma
   levels of the main yolk precursor vitellogenin or to the total mass of
   yolky follicles developing at the time of blood sampling. In contrast to
   E2, plasma androgen levels showed only a very gradual linear decline
   throughout the laying cycle from pre-RYD to clutch completion.
   Furthermore, androgen levels showed less individual variability: 4-fold
   variation among females with greater than or equal to 4 yolky follicles,

Abstract = {{In oviparous vertebrates, maternal steroid allocation to eggs can have
   important fitness consequences for the offspring. However, elevated

   effects, such as enhanced growth and high social status, but may also
   entail costs by suppressing the immune system. In this study,
   testosterone levels in eggs of Chinese painted quail (Coturnix
   chinensis) were experimentally manipulated to evaluate its effects on
   growth and immunocompetence. Testosterone did not affect embryonic
   development, body size or growth during the first 20 days. However,
   elevated testosterone levels during embryonic development were
   immunosuppressive for chicks with inherently higher growth rate.
   Adaptive scenarios where only beneficial effects of increased

Abstract = {{1. High breeding density can cause elevated plasma androgen levels in
   adult birds. Since maternal androgens are deposited into egg yolk, high
   breeding density may result in elevated yolk androgen levels as well.
   2. The relationship between breeding density and yolk androgen levels
   was examined in the European Starling, Sturnus vulgaris. The
   concentration and total content of yolk androstenedione and yolk
   testosterone were measured in eggs from 24 clutches distributed across
   nine different colonies of nestboxes.
   3. Yolk androstenedione and testosterone levels were significantly
   higher in colonies where a greater proportion of nestboxes had active
   nests.
   4. Yolk testosterone levels were significantly higher, and yolk
   androstenedione levels were marginally higher, in colonies with a
   greater absolute number of active nests.
   5. Yolk androgen levels were not related to the number of active nests
   in adjacent nestboxes.
   6. We conclude that female starlings nesting in colonies with higher
   breeding densities transfer more androgen to their eggs.
   7. This relationship may be mediated by increased interfemale
   aggression, particularly towards floater females searching for mates or
   nests to brood parasitize, in high-density colonies. Such a relationship
   between maternal environment and maternal yolk androgens may represent
   adaptive maternal modification of offspring phenotype or a non-adaptive
   physiological constraint which females cannot avoid.}},

Abstract = {{Avian eggs contain, among many components, significant concentrations of
   androgens and other maternal hormones. These hormones can have profound
   influences in the development of the embryo and the nestling, and even
   shape the phenotype of the adult bird. In this review I evaluate the
   research that has been developed in the last ten years in this field,
   and I suggest several lines of research that might be worth following in
   the future. Evidence shows that high levels of androgens in eggs speed
   up embryonic development, boost muscular growth and begging rates in
   nestlings. A study in captivity with canaries Serinus domesticus has
   identified an influence of egg androgen in the social hierarchy of the
   adult bird. Research is needed to ascertain long-term effects of egg
   androgens in the wild, but the picture is a promising one. Several
   studies have found a positive correlation between female hormone levels
   and those of the egg. However, it is still not clear whether this is the
   re! sult of passive transfer or, on the contrary, there are mechanisms
   that control the transfer of hormones from the mother to the egg.
   Whatever the mechanism, several experiments show that females lay eggs
   with higher concentrations of androgens when paired to attractive mates.
   This pattern of differential allocation suggests that egg androgens are
   a costly resource, and that there are limiting factors for the mother or
   the offspring. Research has uncovered several other interesting
   patterns, such as differences between male and female bearing eggs in
   androgen levels, or a positive covariance with breeding density in
   different colonies of the same species. Another exciting issue concerns
   the uneven distribution of egg androgen within the same clutch. It has
   been suggested that females could use this mechanism to control
   aggression and competition among nestlings. To summarise, egg androgen
   allocation constitutes a powerful mechanism which females could use to
   modify offspring ph! enotype. Large between-species differences in egg
   androgen concentrations suggest that a comparative analysis may be the
   best tool to understand the role of the many ecological and evolutionary
   factors that may have shaped the evolution of this character.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal effects can have an adaptive value if they improve the
   performance of offspring. As such, the transfer of maternal testosterone
   (T) to the eggs has been suggested as a mechanism for adaptive maternal
   control of offspring phenotype in birds, although recent studies have
   shown negative effects of testosterone on hatching rate and chick
   survival. Here, we experimentally investigated whether socially
   stressful conditions experienced by female house sparrows during egg
   laying affected their circulating levels of androgens and the amount
   transferred to the eggs. Social stress was simulated by the intrusion of
   a foreign male placed near the nest box during the egg-laying sequence.
   We found that (1) both female and yolk testosterone titres were
   positively related to breeding density; (2) yolk testosterone was
   negatively correlated with maternal testosterone; (3) yolk testosterone
   was positively correlated with the behavioural response of females
   towards the intruder and (4) the interaction between social intrusion
   and breeding density affected the amount of testosterone transferred to
   the eggs. Altogether, our results suggest that females may be able to
   modulate the amount of testosterone they allocate to their eggs
   according to the social environment they experience during egg laying.}},

Abstract = {{It has been proposed that the maternal androgens in avian egg yolk
   enhance offspring fitness by accelerating growth and improving
   competitive ability. Because egg quality is strongly influenced by
   maternal condition, we predicted that females in good condition would
   produce high-quality eggs with relatively high androgen content. We
   experimentally enhanced maternal condition by supplementary feeding
   lesser black-backed gulls (Larus fuscus) during egg formation and
   compared the concentrations of androstenedione (A4),
   5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and testosterone (T) in their eggs with
   those in eggs laid by control females. We also measured circulating
   levels of T in females immediately after laying. Egg androgens could
   affect offspring performance directly through chick development and/or
   indirectly through changes in the competitive ability of a chick
   relative to its siblings. To avoid confounding these two routes, and to
   separate effects operating through the egg itself with those operating
   through experimental changes in parental chick rearing capacity, we
   fostered eggs from both maternal treatment groups singly into the nests
   of unmanipulated parents. Contrary to expectation, mothers with
   experimentally enhanced body condition laid eggs with lower levels of
   androgens, while exhibiting higher circulating T concentrations
   post-laying. Despite these lower levels of egg androgen, offspring
   hatched from eggs laid by mothers in good condition did not show reduced
   growth or survival when reared in the absence of sibling competition.
   Our results demonstrate that yolk androgen concentrations vary with the
   body condition of the female at the time of egg formation and that
   females in good condition reduced the yolk androgen content of their
   eggs without altering offspring performance.}},

Abstract = {{Within- and between-clutch variation in yolk titres of hormones of
   maternal origin has been found in many avian species. So far,
   experiments have revealed mainly beneficial effects of maternal
   androgens. This would also apply to black-headed gulls (Larus
   ridibundus). Previous experiments have shown that chicks benefit from
   these higher levels since their competitive abilities are improved and
   growth and survival probabilities thus enhanced. However, not all
   females show the same increase in yolk hormones from first to last egg
   or invest equally high amounts of androgens in their clutches. Possibly,
   there is a trade-off between the beneficial effects of high androgen
   levels and potential costs, such as increased metabolic rates. We
   studied possible metabolic costs of experimentally elevated yolk
   androgen levels for chicks of several age classes, starting three days
   prior to hatching until fledging at an age of approximately 30 days.
   Daily energy expenditure in the field, measured using the doubly
   labelled water technique, did not differ between treatments or between
   sexes. Oxygen consumption measured in birds at rest in the lab (RMR) did
   not vary between chicks hatched from androgen-injected (T) or
   oil-injected (Oil) control eggs at any age in thermo-neutral or below
   thermo-neutral conditions. Males showed a lower RMR than females towards
   the fledging age. We conclude that it is unlikely that the costs of high

Abstract = {{Hormones of maternal origin are known to be transferred to the egg yolks
   of oviparous species. Several studies have shown that within and between
   clutch variation of maternal androgens may be adaptively tuned.
   Moreover, it has recently been hypothesized that sex steroids of
   maternal origin may play a role in adaptive sex ratio manipulation. For
   sex determination the eggs have to be incubated to allow the germinal
   disc to grow and thus extract sufficient DNA. This means that yolk
   hormone levels are determined after a number of days of incubation and
   this may hamper interpretation of the data. If yolk utilization or
   embryonic hormone production are influenced by the sex of the embryo,
   differences in hormone content at a certain stage of incubation do not
   reflect the mother's initial allocation. In this experiment we show that
   testosterone levels in chicken eggs do not change with incubation
   period. A4 levels decrease between 3 and 5 days of incubation, which we
   cannot explain. Male eggs did not contain higher levels of testosterone
   or androstenedione than female eggs, in contrast to the data reported
   for another galliform species, the peacock. We conclude that it is
   unlikely that maternal androgens are a key factor in the avian sex

Abstract = {{Androgenic hormones occur naturally in bird egg yolk and are known to
   enhance growth in canary and gull chicks. Gil et al. (1999, Science,
   286, 126-128) have recently proposed that female allocation of androgens
   to eggs represents a form of costly maternal investment. This hypothesis
   predicts that females of high quality or high reproductive potential
   should invest more yolk androgens in their eggs than females of low
   quality or low reproductive potential. We tested these predictions by
   examining interfemale variation in allocation of the androgenic steroids
   testosterone and androstenedione to eggs in a wild population of
   European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris. We collected 30 full clutches of
   eggs and captured 22 of the females that laid these clutches for
   phenotypic measurements. In agreement with the hypothesis, we found that
   there was significant interfemale variation in yolk androgen
   concentrations. Furthermore, older females deposited more
   androstenedione and testosterone in eggs than 1-year-old females, and
   females laying early or large clutches deposited more testosterone in
   eggs than females laying late or small clutches. However, females in
   good body condition did not deposit more androgens in eggs than females
   in poor body condition. Large-yolked eggs had a higher total yolk
   androgen content than small-yolked eggs, but larger eggs did not have
   higher concentrations of yolk androgens. The results in general support
   the investment hypothesis of yolk androgen allocation. However, further
   data are needed regarding the costs of yolk androgen allocation and the
   effects of yolk androgens on offspring to substantiate the assumptions
   of the hypothesis. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf

Abstract = {{Maternal hormones are known to be present in avian eggs and can have
   beneficial effects on chick development. Recently, differences in avian
   yolk steroid concentrations between the sexes have been demonstrated,
   and in this context steroids have been proposed to be part of the avian
   sex-determining mechanism. In our study, we show that it is very
   unlikely that androgen concentrations alone are the decisive part of the
   sex-determining mechanism. We found that sex-specific differences in the
   yolk hormones strongly depend on the social rank of the mother. First,
   dominant females, but not subdominant females, allocated significantly
   more testosterone to male eggs than to female eggs. Second, subordinate
   females increased the testosterone concentrations of female eggs.
   This pattern of yolk hormone deposition can be functionally explained.
   In polygynous species such as the chicken, reproductive success is more
   variable in males than in females. Parental investment in sons or
   daughters is therefore expected to occur in direct relation to parental
   rearing capacities. We found that the social status of a hen was indeed
   negatively correlated with her maternal capacities (for example, body
   mass, egg mass). Differential androgen deposition might thus provide a
   mechanism for adaptive maternal investment depending on both the sex of
   the egg and the social status of the mother.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated maternal-fetal hormone transfer in the mountain spiny
   lizard, Sceloporus jarrovi, a viviparous species with a simple
   chorioallantoic placenta. In one experiment, we examined the effect of
   elevated maternal progesterone on fetal and yolk hormone levels.
   Progesterone implants increased maternal progesterone nearly 100-fold;
   however, the resulting increase in fetal and yolk progesterone was only
   about 2\% of that seen in mothers, providing evidence that the placenta
   buffers hormone diffusion. In addition, some effects of progesterone
   treatment differed between male and female fetuses, suggesting that this
   buffering may differ between the sexes. In a second experiment, we
   examined the relationship between maternal and fetal hormone levels in
   viviparous versus oviparous species. We measured endogenous
   progesterone, testosterone, estradiol, and corticosterone levels in
   pregnant S. jarrovi and their fetuses and neonates, and in gravid S.
   graciosus (an oviparous congener) and their fetuses and hatchlings. No
   clear relationship was identified between maternal and fetal or
   hatchling S. graciosus hormone levels. However, the data for S. jarrovi
   suggest that maternal hormones may inhibit perinatal hormone secretion.
   These findings indicate that, despite the relatively recent evolutionary
   origin and simple structure of the S. jarrovi placenta, mechanisms for
   placental mediation of the maternal-fetal endocrine relationship have
   evolved. Although the placenta appears to buffer hormone transport,
   maternal hormones can affect fetal and yolk hormone levels, suggesting
   that disruption of endocrine regulation could be a physiological cost of
   the evolution of viviparity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights

Abstract = {{1. Females of egg-laying vertebrates may adjust the development of their
   offspring to prevailing environmental conditions by regulating the
   deposition of hormones into their eggs. Within- and amng-clutch
   variation in levels of steroid hormones were studied in the egg yolks of
   the Black-Headed Gull (Larus ridibundus, Linnaeus) in relation to
   environmental conditions at the nest site, This species breeds in
   colonies of different densities and in different habitats, and the
   chicks hatch asynchronously.
   2. Egg yolks contained very high levels of androstenedione, substantial
   levels of testosterone and moderate levels of
   5alpha-dihydrotestosterone. Oestrogen (17-oestradiol) was not detected.
   3. Androgen levels increased strongly with laying order, irrespective of
   egg or yolk mass. This may compensate for the disadvantages of the later
   hatching chicks. These results have implications for adaptive hypotheses
   that were proposed for asynchronous incubation.
   4. Eggs of lighter clutches contained more androgens, perhaps to
   compensate for a lower nutritional quality of these eggs.
   5. Birds breeding in the periphery of a colony, being relatively more
   aggressive and having relatively large territories, laid eggs that
   contained more androgens than those of birds breeding in the centre.
   These high yolk androgen levels may facilitate growth and motor
   development of the chicks, which may be especially important for chicks
   developing at the periphery of a colony. Reduced levels may be adaptive
   for birds breeding in the centre, where risk of infectious diseases is
   high, since steroids may be immunosuppressive.
   6. Corrected for nest distance, clutches of birds in high vegetation,
   where predation risk is less severe and therefore competition for nest
   sites perhaps high, contained relatively high levels of androgens. It is
   suggested that the level of yolk androgens reflects the hormonal
   condition of the female, that in turn is influenced by her
   characteristics such as her age and aggressiveness, and the level of
   social stimulation.}},

Abstract = {{The concentrations of maternally derived androgens in the yolks of avian
   eggs vary within and among clutches, but a mechanistic basis for this
   variation has not been elucidated. We investigated in the American
   kestrel, Falco sparverius, whether changes in plasma-prolactin
   concentrations induced by changes in photoperiod and food supply affect
   yolk-androgen concentrations. Over the course of a photoinduced breeding
   period in the laboratory, we measured concentrations of plasma
   immunoreactive prolactin (ir-prolactin) in female kestrels with ad
   libitum food availability (control) or food availability that was
   reduced during the early breeding period. In a second laboratory study,
   we administered via osmotic mini-pumps ovine prolactin (o-prolactin) to
   females beginning on the day they laid their first egg of a clutch
   (egg-day 1) to determine the effects of high prolactin concentrations on
   yolk-androgen concentrations. In both this study and one on free-living
   kestrels, we quantified changes in yolk-androgen concentrations with
   date of clutch initiation. Concentrations of ir-prolactin in nonlaying
   females rose with date, irrespective of food treatment. Egg-day I
   ir-prolactin concentrations were higher in control females laying late
   during the breeding phase than in those laying early. This increase was
   absent in food-reduced females. Yolk-androgen concentrations in eggs 3
   and 4 but not eggs I and 2 of the clutch were higher in clutches
   initiated late than in clutches initiated early in the breeding phase in
   both the field and laboratory. o-Prolactin treatment elevated
   yolk-testosterone but not androstenedione concentrations. These findings
   suggest that, in American kestrels, seasonal and laying-associated
   increases in plasma-prolactin concentrations elevate yolk-testosterone
   concentrations. Food availability and other factors may interact with
   date to regulate the effects of prolactin on yolk-testosterone
   deposition. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science.}},

Abstract = {{Sex steroids of presumably maternal origin have been found in avian,
   crocodilian, and chelonian egg yolks, and they can affect offspring
   morphology and behavior. The present study reports testosterone (T)
   levels to which embryos are potentially exposed in the green anole
   (Anolis carolinensis), a lizard with genotypic sex determination. We
   documented plasma and yolk T concentrations in adult females, in their
   developing follicles and eggs, and in freshly oviposited and incubating
   eggs. Plasma T was higher in reproductively active than in
   reproductively inactive females. Within reproductively active females,
   those with a single, large yolking follicle had higher plasma T than
   those that had one or more shelling, oviductal eggs. Individual females
   contributed different amounts of T to their yolks, but within females,
   more mature follicles or eggs consistently had higher yolk T
   concentrations than did less mature follicles or eggs. Similar to
   previous research, yolk T concentrations at oviposition were higher in
   male eggs than in female eggs. However, T levels during incubation did
   not differ by embryo sex, but rather increased in both male and female
   eggs. These results suggest that T plays a role in the reproductive
   physiology of females and potentially in the phenotypic development of
   their offspring. Furthermore, whereas the yolk T increase observed
   during follicular maturation is clearly a maternal influence, it remains
   unclear whether that observed during egg development (i.e.,
   postfertilization) results from a lack of T uptake by the embryo as yolk
   is absorbed, from embryonic production of T that diffuses into the yolk,
   or from some combination of these processes. Because lizard embryos are
   comparatively well developed at oviposition, the assumption that yolk
   steroids are strictly of maternal origin may require modification, and
   the possibility that embryos are modulating their own steroid
   environment needs to be explored. (C) 2001 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Maternally derived traits, such as within-clutch variation in the amount
   of testosterone deposited in egg yolks, may have profound effects on
   offspring fitness. Offspring with elevated levels of testosterone may
   benefit from increased competitive ability through effects on aggression
   and growth rate. However, elevated levels of testosterone are also
   associated with costs of increased peroxidative damage from free
   radicals and consequent oxidative stress. Diet-derived antioxidants,
   such as vitamin E and various carotenoids, provide protection against
   the deleterious effects of oxidative stress. Here we show that
   within-clutch variation in yolk testosterone is the opposite to that of
   yolk antioxidant concentration in the lesser black-backed gull Larus
   fuscus. We provide evidence that suggests that these two direct maternal
   effects are, in fact, complementary and, in conjunction with an indirect
   maternal effect (the onset of incubation), may provide an adaptive
   mechanism for parental favoritism in response to environmental
   variability. The potential implications of these findings with respect
   to previous investigations on variation in yolk testosterone
   concentrations and on the understanding of intrafamilial dynamics are

Abstract = {{Maternally derived hormones in cleidoic eggs have been implicated in
   mediating growth, behavior, and social interactions among offspring.
   Given these widespread and significant effects. hormonal investments
   have the potential to greatly influence fitness of offspring.
   Intraspecific variation can exist at three levels (within individual
   eggs, among eggs within clutches, and among eggs from different
   females), each of which has different implications for offspring. We
   characterized all three levels of variation in maternally derived
   androgens (testosterone and androstenedione) present in yolks of
   American coot eggs. We found no variation in testosterone levels within
   eggs which suggests that embryos are exposed to constant androgen levels
   during development. and that field-based yolk biopsies are an
   appropriate way to sample eggs for this species. Within clutches,
   early-laid eggs had higher androgen levels than late-laid eggs, and this
   pattern may exacerbate negative effects of hatching asynchrony on chicks
   from late-hatching eggs if androgens provide chicks with a behavioral or
   growth advantage over chicks from eggs with lower androgen levels.
   American coots lay large clutches, and unequal resource allocation among
   offspring may be the optimal strategy for females with access to limited
   resources. Most of the variation in androgen levels occurred among eggs
   from different females. Females nesting on ponds with two other pairs
   laid eggs with significantly higher androgen levels than females living
   on ponds with fewer pairs. This suggests that increased territory
   defense behaviors influence the levels of androgens allocated to eggs
   and may be one mechanism underlying density-dependent effects on
   reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of age, handling-induced stress, yolk androgens, and body
   condition on plasma corticosterone levels were investigated in
   free-living nestling American kestrels, Falco sparverius, a
   semialtricial falcon species. In an observational study, corticosterone
   levels varied with age and handling time. Specifically, corticosterone
   was low until age 15 days and then rose from age 20 through 25 days.
   Nestlings as young as age 10 days showed a handling-induced rise in
   corticosterone. Neither sex nor hatching order of the nestling affected
   corticosterone levels. Concentrations of maternally derived yolk
   androgens have previously been shown to be lower in first-laid than in
   later-laid eggs in the clutch. In an experimental study, androgens were
   injected into the yolk of the first-laid egg to elevate its levels to
   those of later-laid eggs, a treatment that substantially reduces
   nestling body condition compared with that of controls. Yolk androgen
   treatment elevated posthatching corticosterone levels compared with
   those of controls, and corticosterone levels were negatively correlated
   with body condition. These findings indicate that even very young,
   developing birds can show stress-induced increases in corticosterone and
   that age-related changes in corticosterone secretion may be modified by
   body condition and maternal effects such as yolk androgen deposition.
   The short- and long-term consequences of high glucocorticosteroid levels
   in young, developing vertebrates are largely unknown. (C) 2001 Academic

Abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that mother birds counterbalance the negative
   effects of hatching asynchrony for later-hatched chicks by increasing
   the yolk androgen concentrations in consecutive eggs of their clutch. In
   doing so. the) may adaptively tune each offspring's competitive ability
   and, thus, growth and survival. However, evidence in support of this
   hypothesis is contradictory. The yolk concentrations of maternal
   androgens in the eggs of black-headed gulls increase significantly with
   the laying order of the eggs in a clutch. We experimentally tested the
   functional consequences of this increase on chick development under
   natural conditions by injecting eggs with either an oil or androgen
   solution. We created experimental clutches in which androgen levels
   either stayed constant or increased with laying order while controlling
   for differences in egg quality by using only first-laid eggs. We then
   compared development, growth and survival between these broods. Androgen
   treatment enhanced embryonic development because androgen-treated eggs
   hatched half a day earlier than controls: while their size at hatching
   was similar to oil-treated controls. Androgen treatment did not increase
   chick survival, hut it enhanced growth.,Androgen-treated, third-hatched
   chicks had a higher body mass and longer legs than third-hatched chicks
   that hatched from oil-treated eggs. At the same time, growth of first
   chicks which M ere all oil treated was reduced by the presence of two
   androgen-treated siblings, suggesting that yolk androgens enhance the
   competitive ability of later-hatched chicks. Our results support the
   hypothesis that transfer of different amounts of androgens to the eggs
   of a clutch is a mechanism by which mothers maximize their reproductive
   output.}},

Abstract = {{Females may favour some offspring over others by differential deposition
   of yolk hormones. In American kestrels (Falco sparverius), we found that
   yolks of eggs laid late in the sequence of a clutch had more
   testosterone (T) and androstenedione (A(4)) than yolks of first-laid
   eggs. To investigate the effects of these yolk androgens on nestling
   `fitness', we injected both T and A(4) into the yolks of first-laid eggs
   and compared their hatching time, nestling growth and nestling survival
   with those of first laid eggs in which we injected vehicle as a control.
   Compared to controls, injection of T and A, at a dose intended to
   increase their levels to those of later-laid eggs delayed hatching and
   reduced nestling growth and survival rates. Yolk androgen treatment of
   egg 1 had no effect on survival of siblings hatching from subsequently
   laid eggs. The adverse actions of yolk androgen treatment in the kestrel
   are in contrast to the favourable actions of yolk T treatment found
   previously in canaries (Serinus canaria). Additional studies are
   necessary in order to determine whether the deposition of yolk androgens
   is an adaptive form of parental favouritism or an adverse by-product of
   endocrine processes during egg formation. Despite its adaptive
   significance, such `transgenerational' effects of steroid hormones may
   have helped to evolutionarily shape the hormonal mechanisms regulating
   reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal hormones can play an important role in the development of fish
   larvae. Levels of the stress hormone, cortisol, in females are elevated
   by social interactions and transferred directly to the yolk of eggs,
   where they may influence developmental rates. In some vertebrates,
   prenatal exposure to high levels of testosterone determine early growth
   rates, social status and reproductive success. The present study
   examined whether post-fertilization exposure of eggs of the tropical
   damsel fish, Pomacentrus amboinensis (Pomacentridae), to natural levels
   of cortisol or testosterone directly affects larval morphology at
   hatching. Maternal and egg levels of cortisol and testosterone varied
   widely among clutches of eggs from local populations around Lizard
   Island on the Great Barrier Reef. The morphology of larvae produced by
   these local fish populations also varied widely and differed
   significantly among sites (e.g., standard length: 2.6-3.4 mm; yolk sac
   area: 0.01-0.13 x 10(-2) mm(2)). Laboratory experiments showed that
   elevated cortisol levels in the egg reduced larval length at hatching,
   while slight elevations in testosterone increased yolk sac size. The
   influence of testosterone, acid to a smaller extent cortisol, on larval
   morphology differed among egg clutches. These differences were partly
   explained by differences in initial egg hormone levels. Morphological
   changes induced by experimental hormonal regimes encompassed the entire
   range of variability in body attributes found in field populations. Tt
   is unclear whether cortisol influences growth alone or development rate
   or both. Testosterone appears to influence yolk utilization rates, and
   has no significant effect on growth, in contrast to its role in later
   developmental stages. Maternally derived cortisol and testosterone are
   important in regulating growth, development, and nutritive reserves of
   the embryo and larvae of this fish species. Factors that influence the
   maternal levels of cortisol and testosterone may have 3 major impact on
   laval mortality schedules and, therefore, on which breeding individuals
   contribute to the next generation.}},

Abstract = {{Vertebrate eggs contain maternal hormones, including steroids, In birds
   the yolk androgen contents vary among species and within species among
   the eggs of successive clutches and among the eggs of a clutch.
   Behavioral studies suggest that maternal androgens influence development
   and that differential androgen allocation functions to influence
   offspring fitness. The mechanisms of differential androgen allocation to
   specific eggs are not well understood, but they may be related to
   changes oo in follicular steroidogenesis during egg formation. The
   mechanisms by which maternal steroids influence embryonic development
   are also unknown although enzymes for steroid metabolism and steroid
   receptors are present during early developmental stages. I suggest here
   that vertebrate ovarian steroidogenesis has evolved to supply maternal
   steroids to the embryo for adaptive modifications of offspring
   development and fitness.}},
