Multivariate effects on offspring phenotype were evaluated in a study on captive zebra finches, by simultaneously manipulating maternally derived antibodies (MAb) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment of mothers and injection of testosterone into the egg yolk. LPS treatment had a positive effect on body mass growth at 30 days after hatching and immune response at sexual maturity, while egg testosterone treatment positively influenced immune response at fledging and courtship behaviour in sexually mature male offspring. Maternal effects are known to modulate offspring telomere length (TL). However, the multivariate effects of egg-derived maternal components on offspring telomere dynamics from hatching to sexual maturity are undefined. Here, we tested: (1) the effects of LPS and testosterone treatments on TL from hatching to sexual maturity (day 82); (2) how LPS treatment modulated TL over reproduction in adult females; and (3) the relationship between maternal and offspring TL. We predicted that TL would be shorter in LPS fledglings (as a cost of faster growth) and that TL would be longer in sexually mature adults after yolk testosterone treatment (as a proxy of individual quality). In adult females, there was an overall negative relationship between laying and rearing investments and TL, this relationship was weaker in LPS-treated females. In chicks, there was an overall negative effect of LPS treatment on TL measured at fledging and sexual maturity (day 25-82). In addition, at fledging, there was a SexxLPSxTestosterone interaction, suggesting the existence of antagonistic effects of our treatments. Our data partially support the hypothesis that telomeres are proxies of individual quality and that individual differences in TL are established very early in life."

However, recent evidence indicates that maternal GCs may adaptively programme particular physiological and molecular pathways during development to enhance offspring fitness. In this context, an important mechanism through which maternal GCs may lastingly affect offspring phenotypic quality and survival is via effects on embryo telomerase activity and so on offspring postnatal telomere length. Here, using a field experimental design for which we manipulated the corticosterone content in yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) eggs, we show that embryos from corticosterone-injected eggs not only had a higher telomerase activity but also longer telomeres just after hatching. A complementary analysis further revealed that gull hatchlings with longer telomeres had a higher survival probability during the period when most of the chick mortality occurs. Given the important role that telomere length and its restoring mechanisms have on ageing trajectories and disease risk, our findings provide a new mechanistic link by which mothers may presumably shape offspring life-history trajectories and phenotype."

This pleiotropy, sex dependency and persistency may be the consequence of developmental programming of basic systemic processes such as adrenocortical activity or metabolic rate. We investigated whether experimentally increased in ovo exposure to testosterone influenced hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal function, i.e. baseline and stress-induced corticosterone secretion, and resting metabolic rate (RMR) of adult male and female house sparrows (Passer domesticus). In previous experiments with this passerine bird we demonstrated effects of embryonic testosterone exposure on adult agonistic and sexual behavior and survival. Here we report that baseline corticosterone levels and the stress secretion profile of corticosterone are modified by in ovo testosterone in a sex-specific and life history stage-dependent manner. Compared with controls, males from testosterone-treated eggs had higher baseline corticosterone levels, whereas females from testosterone-treated eggs showed prolonged stress-induced corticosterone secretion during the reproductive but not the non-reproductive phase. Adult RMR was unaffected by in ovo testosterone treatment but correlated with integrated corticosterone stress secretion levels. We conclude that exposure of the embryo to testosterone programs the hypothalamus- pituitary-adrenal axis in a sex-specific manner that in females depends, in expression, on reproductive state. The modified baseline corticosterone levels in males and stress-induced corticosterone levels in females may explain some of the long-lasting effects of maternal testosterone in the egg on behavior and could be linked to previously observed reduced mortality of testosterone-treated females."

To flexibly influence offspring, mothers should be able to transmit the hormonal signals independent of their own hormonal status. However, the ability to regulate hormone transfer to the next generation is under debate. We studied the transfer of thyroid hormones (THs) to eggs in a bird model. We elevated thyroxine (T-4, the prohormone for the biologically active triiodothyronine, T-3) during egg laying using T-4 implants in females of a wild population of pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca), and measured the resulting plasma and yolk T-4 and T-3 levels. We found an increase in plasma and yolk T-4 and no change in plasma or yolk T-3 concentration, leading to a decrease in yolk T-3/T-4 ratio in response to the T-4 treatment. The yolk T-3/T-4 ratio was similar to the plasma ratio in females during the yolking phase. This suggests that mothers are not able to regulate TH transfer to yolk but may regulate the T-4 to T-3 conversion to avoid potential costs of elevated exposure to the active hormone to herself and to her progeny. The absence of regulation in hormone transfer to eggs is in contrast to our predictions. Future studies on deiodinase activity that converts T-4 to T-3 in maternal and embryonic tissues may help our understanding of how mothers regulate circulating THs during breeding, as well as the embryos' role in converting maternal T-4 to its biologically active T-3 form during development."

Thus, as climate change leads to rapid increases in water temperatures in rivers, aquatic ectotherms, such as fish may be highly impacted. Organisms can respond to these stressors through flexible and rapid phenotypic change induced via developmental and/or transgenerational plasticity. In oviparous species, gravid females may translate environmental stress across generations via increased exposure of eggs to maternally derived glucocorticoids (i.e., maternal stress), which has been shown to result in diverse phenotypic effects in offspring. Recent studies suggest these phenotypic changes from maternal glucocorticoids may elicit predictive adaptive responses, where offspring exposed to maternal stress may be better prepared for the stressful environment they will encounter (i.e., environmental match hypothesis). We applied the environmental match hypothesis to examine whether a prenatal exogenous increase in egg cortisol may prepare Chinook salmon offspring (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) to cope with thermal challenges after being reared in chronically elevated temperatures. Specifically, we exposed eggs to aqueous bath of cortisol-dosed (1,000 ng/mL) or control (0 ng/ml) solutions, and then raised both treatments at current (+0 degrees C-contemporary ambient river temperature) or elevated (+3 degrees C-projected future river temperature) thermal regimes. We quantified thermal performance in fish 7-9 month post fertilization using two methods: via critical thermal maximum (CTMax), and energetic responses (in plasma cortisol, glucose, and lactate) to environmentally relevant, but challenging thermal spikes over 3 days. Overall, we found that exposure to elevated rearing temperatures had a large impact on thermal tolerance, where elevated-temperature reared offspring had significantly higher CTMax. In comparison, egg cortisol treatment had little to no clear effects on CTMax and blood energetic response. Our study demonstrates the importance of elevated water temperatures as an inducer of offspring phenotypes (via early developmental cues), and highlights the significance of examining offspring performance in environments with ecologically relevant stressors."

In the case of birds, GBHs may be transferred directly from mothers to eggs, or they may indirectly influence offspring performance by altered maternal resource allocation to eggs. We experimentally exposed a parental generation of Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica) to GBHs (200mg/kg feed) or respective controls. Glyphosate residues were found in eggs (ca 0.76kg/mg). Embryonic development tended to be poorer in the eggs of GBH-exposed parents (76\% of eggs showed normal development) compared to control parents (89\% normal eggs).

We detected no differences in egg quality (egg, yolk, or shell mass, egg hormone concentration) across the treatment groups.

Maternal stress can programme physiological and behavioural phenotypes in offspring, which may be maladaptive if maternal and offspring environments are mismatched. We investigated effects of a match and mismatch between egg cortisol and offspring stress levels in lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, using artificially elevated egg cortisol levels (simulating maternal stress) and a chronic unpredictable stress regime for offspring after hatch. Offspring cortisol levels were quantified at baseline and after an acute stressor. Multiple measures of offspring swimming activity were assessed in behaviour trials. Individuals that experienced elevated egg cortisol and high offspring stress exhibited a diminished cortisol response to an acute stressor, but responses varied among offspring from different families. Results suggest that the interaction between maternal and offspring experience may cue an offspring phenotype that is adaptive in high-stress conditions. Principal components analysis characterizing interindividual variation in offspring behavioural variables showed that treatment significantly affected multivariate offspring response along the PC1 axis (associated with inactivity), and both treatment and family significantly affected response along the PC2 axis (associated with shorter distance moved). The largest differences for PC1 occurred between the `mismatch' treatments (high egg cortisol and low offspring stress exhibiting lower activity; low egg cortisol and high offspring stress exhibiting higher activity), indicating that the combination of egg cortisol and offspring stress is more important in determining offspring behaviour than is egg cortisol or offspring stress alone. Findings suggest that family effects, such as genetic components or maternal experience, may mediate how the interaction of maternal and offspring stress influences offspring physiological and behavioural outcomes, and indicate the need for further research into environmental factors experienced by females that influence how offspring respond to egg cortisol and early life stress.

To address maternal effects as potential mechanisms, we compared maternal hormone and antibody concentrations in eggs between city and forest populations of European blackbirds (Turdus merula), a widely distributed species for which previous research demonstrated differences in behavioral and physiological traits. We measured egg and yolk mass, yolk concentrations of androgens (androstenedione {[}A(4)], testosterone {[}T], 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone {[}5 alpha-DHT], and immunoglobulins {[}IgY]) and related them to population, clutch size, laying order, embryo sex, and progress of breeding season. We show (a) earlier onset of laying in the city than forest population, but similar egg and clutch size; (b) higher overall yolk androgen concentrations in the forest than the city population (sex-dependent for T); (c) greater among-female variation of yolk T and 5 alpha-DHT concentrations in the forest than city population, but similar within-clutch variation; (d) similar IgY concentrations with a seasonal decline in both populations; and (e) population-specific positive (city) or negative (forest) association of yolk A(4) and T with IgY concentrations. Our results are consistent with the hypotheses that hormone-mediated maternal effects contribute to differences in behavioral and physiological traits between city and forest individuals and that yolk androgen and immunoglobulin levels can exhibit population-specific relationships rather than trade-off against each other."

To address the role steroid metabolism plays in mediating yolk testosterone effects, we used European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) eggs to characterize the timing of testosterone metabolism and determine whether etiocholanolone, a prominent metabolite of testosterone in avian embryos, is capable of affecting early embryonic development. Tritiated testosterone was injected into freshly laid eggs to characterize steroid movement and metabolism during early development. Varying levels of etiocholanolone were also injected into eggs, with incubation for either 3 or 5 days, to test whether etiocholanolone influences the early growth of embryonic tissues. The conversion of testosterone to etiocholanolonewas initiated within 12 h of injection, but the increase in etiocholanolone was transient, indicating that etiocholanolone is also subject to metabolism, and that exposure to maternal etiocholanolone is limited to a short period during early development. Exogenous etiocholanolone manipulation had no significant effect on the growth rate of the embryos or extraembryonic membranes early in development. Thus, the conversion of testosterone to etiocholanolone may be an inactivation pathway that buffers the embryo from maternal steroids, with any effects of yolk testosterone resulting from testosterone that escapes metabolism; alternatively, etiocholanolone may influence processes other than growth or take additional time to manifest."

We investigated whether seasonal changes between eggs in the yolk hormones testosterone (Testo), progesterone (Prog) and corticosterone (Cort) also occur in the grey partridge, a synchronously hatching precocial species without direct food competition between siblings. Specifically we asked whether yolk hormone concentrations systematically vary with season and whether they affect the offspring's hatching mass, mass gain, circulating baseline and stress-induced Cort. Additionally, we investigated the effect of genetic background and food availability on yolk hormone concentrations by subjecting grey partridge hens of two strains (wild and domesticated) to two different feeding regimes (predictable vs. unpredictable feeding) during egg laying. We hypothesized that egg hormone concentrations change over the season, but breeding in captivity over many generations and ad libitum food access could have resulted in domestication effects which abolished potential seasonal effects. Results showed that progressing season had a strong positive effect on yolk Prog and yolk Testo, but not on yolk Cort. Feeding regimes and strain had no effect on yolk hormones. Offspring mass and mass gain increased and baseline Cort decreased with progressing season. In addition, yolk Testo correlated positively with offspring mass gain and negatively with baseline Cort, while yolk Prog had a positive correlation with baseline Cort. Strain and feeding regimes of the mother had no effect on offspring traits. In conclusion, grey partridge chicks hatching late in the season might benefit from the increased concentrations of the growth-stimulating yolk Testo and by this catch-up in development. Hence, yolk hormone concentration could adaptively shape the offspring phenotype in a precocial species."

Despite their relevance for nestling development, factors accounting for the observed within- and between-clutch variation are still poorly known. By using a cross-sectional sampling approach, we tested the effect of female age, laying order and laying date on the deposition of yolk androstenedione (A4) and testosterone (T), since young and older females could maximize their fitness differently according to breeding conditions. We found a remarkable lack of differences in overall yolk androgen levels across different ages. However, comparing first-year with older females, our results showed that age did not influence yolk T levels at the beginning of the breeding season, whereas at the end, first-year females transferred lower hormone levels than older females. Within clutches, both androgens increased across the laying sequence, suggesting that late nestlings benefit from an increased allocation that could compensate hatching asynchrony. However, when considering A4, we found that, whereas older females always increased A4 levels across the laying sequence, first-year females did not increase it at the end of the breeding season, thus increasing the likelihood of brood reduction when environmental conditions became hardest. These findings suggest that yolk A4 variation may be particularly important at the within-clutch scale, by providing females with a tool to modify nestling hierarchies."

We argued those are consistent with the different reproductive strategies of dominant and subordinate males. Furthermore, in line with offspring sex-dependent growth patterns females transferred significantly more androstenedione to female than male embryos when mated with winners, while doing the opposite when mated with losers. We concluded therefore that female reproductive investment was affected by both partner quality and embryo sex.

In our study, we used Japanese quail, Coturnix japonica, lines divergently selected for high (HET) and low (LET) egg T concentrations to examine whether this genetic variation in yolk T levels is linked to female mating decisions. First, we analysed line differences in male-typical reproductive behaviour and how this behavioural response is affected by female line identity. Males were tested with females from the same (match pairs) and opposite (cross pairs) lines. Next, female mate preferences were evaluated in a two-choice test in which females were allowed to choose between males from the same and opposite lines. We found no line differences in male copulatory behaviour. Interestingly, a shorter latency to copulate and a higher number of copulations were recorded in LET males when they were mated with HET than LET females. No differences between match and cross pairs were found in HET males. In the two-choice test, LET females displayed a preference for males from the same over the opposite line, but HET females did not discriminate between LET and HET males. Collectively, these results demonstrate that genetically high yolk T deposition is related to higher receptivity and reduced choosiness in female mate preferences in Japanese quail. Moreover, our results indicate an important link between maternal investment, reproductive physiology and female mating decisions, pointing out evolutionary implications and a role of variation in female mate choice in sexual selection.

In this study, we studied the between- and within-individual variation of maternal thyroid hormones (THs) in egg yolk of wild great tits (Parus major) and estimated the individual plasticity of maternal yolk THs across environmental temperature, clutch initiation dates, and egg laying order using linear mixed effects models. Interestingly, our models provide statistical evidence that the two main THs-the main biologically active hormone T3 and T4, which is mostly considered a prohormone-exhibited different variation patterns. Yolk T3 showed significant between-individual variation on the average levels, in line with its previously reported moderate heritability. Yolk T4, however, showed significant between-clutch variation in the pattern over the laying sequence, suggesting a great within-individual plasticity. Our findings suggest that the role and function of the hormone within the endocrine axis likely influences its flexibility to respond to environmental change. Whether the flexibility of T4 deposition brings a fitness advantage should be examined along with its potential effects on offspring, which remain to be further investigated."

This is true of placental vertebrates as well as egg-laying vertebrates where levels of progesterone in the yolk tend to be higher than most other steroids in the yolk. Bird eggs provide an opportunity to investigate the effects of progesterone on embryonic development because progesterone can be easily manipulated without any confounding effects on maternal physiology. To understand how progesterone might influence embryonic development, it is important to characterize the metabolic fate of progesterone given its potential to be converted to a wide range of steroids. We investigated the metabolic fate of tritiated progesterone over the first four days of development using chicken eggs (Gallus gallus) and identified 5 beta-pregnanedione as the primary metabolite during this period. After only one day of development, 5 beta-pregnanedione could be detected within the yolk. Levels of 5 beta-pregnanedione in both the yolk and albumen tended to rise early in development but conjugated metabolites began to accumulate towards the end of our sampling period. Additionally, in vitro assays using embryo homogenates collected after 72 h of development demonstrated that embryos were capable of carrying out the conversion of progesterone to 5 beta-pregnanedione. Overall these results have important implications for deciphering the mechanisms through which yolk progesterone might influence embryonic development. Effects could arise via progesterone receptors or receptors capable of binding 5 beta-pregnanedione but we found no evidence that progesterone is serving as a precursor for androgen or estrogen production."

However, few studies have focused on multiple maternally derived hormones regulated by independent axes in the endocrine system, and those studies that have, mainly focus on corticosterone and testosterone. In this study, within and among female variation in testosterone and triiodothyronine concentrations in egg yolks were measured in three free-living Franklin's Gull (Leucophaeus pipixcan) populations. Testosterone (T), but not triiodothyronine (T3), concentrations increase within a female's clutch such that eggs laid later in the clutch have increasingly higher concentrations (from a mean of 1.97 log pg T/mg yolk for the first egg to 2.98 log pg T/mg yolk for the third egg compared to a mean of 0.14 log pg T3/mg yolk for the first egg to 0.31 log pg T3/mg yolk for the third egg). Both testosterone and triiodothyronine concentrations increase among females across the breeding season such that eggs laid later in the season have significantly higher hormone concentrations (mean of 2.37 log pg T/mg yolk and mean of -0.03 log pg T3/mg yolk) than eggs laid early in the season (mean of 1.95 log pg T/mg yolk and mean of -0.17 log pg T3/mg yolk)."

In the Greater Rhea (Rhea americana), we previously found that yolk immunoreactive corticosterone is influenced by the quality of the maternal environment: eggs laid by females of the intensive rearing system (IRS), living in poor captive conditions, had higher yolk immunoreactive corticosterone than those produced by females of the semi-extensive rearing system (SRS), living in better conditions. Here, we evaluate if these different hormone levels are associated with the production of different phenotypes. We collected eggs from the IRS and SRS for hormonal quantification and artificial incubation. Then, half of the chicks selected from each environment were exposed to a capture and restraint protocol, and the rest remained undisturbed and were used as controls. In the IRS, we found that higher yolk immunoreactive corticosterone was associated with the production of chicks that had reduced hatchability, lower hatchling mass and higher baseline fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGM) than those produced by SRS females. Moreover, after capture and restraint, IRS chicks did not modify their FGM nor their behaviors compared to their controls, while SRS chicks increased their FGM and spent more time ambulating and less time pecking, compared to their controls. These results indicate that yolk immunoreactive corticosterone could modify offspring phenotype. Although future studies are needed to elucidate their implications for fitness, our results suggest that yolk corticosterone could be mediating an adaptive maternal effect that allows individuals to better cope with poor conditions."

Within avian broods, differential maternal investment of resources across the laying sequence is thought to be an adaptive strategy to modulate competitive hierarchies induced by hatching asynchrony. In this study, we evaluated the relative importance of maternally derived within-clutch variation and the asymmetric post-hatching environment for growth and survival of common tern (Sterna hirundo) siblings. We experimentally manipulated hatching order, resulting in chicks from last-laid eggs hatching first and vice versa. Although both initial age and size asymmetries were larger within experimental than control broods, the early survival of last-hatched chicks was similar between groups. Initial positive effects of egg size disappeared as siblings approached fledging. Ultimately at fledging, both within-brood growth and cumulative survival patterns were similar between experimental and control broods, suggesting that the effects of systematic variation of egg constituents (e.g., maternally derived yolk hormones) and egg size are too subtle and largely overwhelmed by the effects of hatching asynchrony. Therefore, we conclude that variation in offspring phenotypes is pre-dominantly determined by the social environment experienced post-hatching. Maternal effects may further fine-tune phenotypic variation in response to varying environmental conditions, but this needs to be tested through empirical studies in which multiple maternal effects are measured simultaneously under different environmental conditions."

Yet, females may also use temperatures as a cue for the risk of mismatch latter in the season. Thus, higher temperatures may be correlated to an acceleration of embryonic development (e.g. via hormonal manipulation). We performed an experiment in which night-time temperature was increased in the nestbox by approximately 1 degrees C throughout the entire laying period in great tits (Parus major). We collected one pre-treatment egg (beginning of the laying sequence) and one post-treatment egg (end of the laying sequence). Egg content (yolk androgens and lysozymes in the albumen), eggshell coloration, eggshell mass, egg mass, and shape were not affected by the treatment. However, last-laid eggs in clutches from control nestboxes had a thicker eggshell than last-laid eggs from heated nestboxes, suggesting a putative slight decrease of maternal investment with the experimental increase of temperature. We also observed effects of the laying sequence on egg characteristics. Eggs that were laid late in the laying sequence were heavier, larger, had larger spots and higher yolk androgens than eggs laid earlier.

In contrast, the impact of maternal corticosterone (CORT) is much less studied. CORT, the principal avian glucocorticoid hormone, is thought to be passively transferred to the egg yolk from the maternal plasma. Maternal CORT may play a role in determining the development of young birds by adaptively programming offspring for their environment. We developed a protocol which effectively quantifies yolk CORT concentrations both within and across clutches, using solid-phase extraction and radioimmunoassay. We hypothesised that Gouldian Finch (Erythrura gouldiae) mothers would differ in their yolk CORT concentrations and that maternal condition would relate to absolute yolk CORT deposition. We found variation in yolk CORT concentrations between clutches, whilst yolk CORT increased with egg number in the first breeding season and negatively correlated with yolk mass. Yet, contrary to our predictions, neither maternal mass nor clutch size showed any relationship to yolk CORT concentrations or to egg or yolk mass. Our data suggest that yolk CORT varies with maternal identity for reasons which do not appear to be linked to maternal condition. Further research is needed to determine the link between maternal and egg yolk concentrations at the individual level.

However, such effects have been rarely studied, especially in wild populations. We studied the associations between environmental elemental pollution (As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb) and maternally-derived egg thyroid hormones (THs) as well as nestling THs in great tits (Parus major) using extensive sampling of four pairs of polluted and reference populations across Europe (Finland, Belgium, Hungary, Portugal). Previous studies in these populations showed that breeding success, nestling growth and adult and nestling physiology were altered in polluted zones compared to reference zones. We sampled non-incubated eggs to measure maternally-derived egg THs, measured nestling plasma THs and used nestling faeces for assessing local elemental exposure. We also studied whether the effect of elemental pollution on endocrine traits is dependent on calcium (Ca) availability (faecal Ca as a proxy) as low Ca increases toxicity of some elements. Birds in the polluted zones were exposed to markedly higher levels of toxic elements than in reference zones at the populations in Finland, Belgium and Hungary. In contrast to our predictions, we did not find any associations between overall elemental pollution, or individual element concentrations and egg TH and nestling plasma TH levels. However, we found some indication that the effect of metals (Cd and Cu) on egg THs is dependent on Ca availability.

We hypothesized that human behaviour triggers maternal effects via variations in yolk hormone levels. For five consecutive weeks, two groups of hens were exposed to the same durations of human presence (30 min twice a day, five days a week) but the behaviour of the human differed between groups. The first group (H +) was exposed to predictable arrival of the experimenter, slow movements combined with static presence, stroking daring handling and human voice. Whereas the second group of hens (H-) was exposed to unpredictable arrival of the experimenter which remained silent, in motion, and did not provide stroking during handling. At the end of the treatment, we evaluated egg quality and offspring behaviour. We found that avoidance of the experimenter by H+ hens but not by H- hens decreased significantly. Fertility rates and concentrations of yolk progesterone and estradiol in H + hens' eggs were higher than in H- hens' eggs. Fear of humans, neophobia or the capacity to solve a detour task did not differ significantly between H+ and Hchicks. Social discrimination tests showed that H+ chicks but not Fl- chicks typically preferred a familiar conspecific to a stranger. These results show that, with the same duration in the presence of the birds, humans through their behaviour engender variations in fertility rates, yolk hormone levels and transgenerational effects on social skills.

Direct predation risk elevates glucocorticoid concentration in the eggs of females, and so indirect predation risk communicated via parental effects may also affect glucocorticoids in the eggs of daughters. Parents may also change their care patterns under predation risk, which could influence the development of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (stress axis) of offspring, which is responsible for the secretion of glucocorticoids. Therefore, in systems where males make substantial contributions to offspring care, paternal effects may also affect daughters' egg glucocorticoids. Question: Are there predator-induced parental effects (maternal, paternal, or joint parental effects) on the concentration of glucocorticoids in daughters' eggs? Organism: Threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from the Chehalis River, Washington, USA. Freshwater and riverine ecotypes. Methods: We exposed threespine stickleback mothers, fathers, both, or neither to a model predator at developmentally appropriate times using a fully factorial design. Control parents experienced no disturbance. Mothers were exposed to a model predator during egg production and fathers were exposed pre-fertilization and during egg care (but before embryos developed eyes). We then tested the concentration of glucocorticoids in the eggs of daughters using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: Daughters of predator-exposed parents (both parents exposed to model predator) had higher glucocorticoid concentrations in their eggs than daughters of control, unexposed parents. Daughters of predator-exposed mothers-only and predator-exposed fathers-only did not differ from controls or jointly predator-exposed parents. Therefore, predator-induced maternal and paternal effects may cumulatively impact the gametes of their daughters, suggesting a mechanism through which predation risk may indirectly influence the next generation (grand-offspring)."

In this study, we experimentally elevated yolk TH content in a wild migratory passerine species, the collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis, to investigate the effects on hatching success, nestling growth and oxidative stress. We found that TH-injected eggs had a higher hatching success, and the nestlings hatched from TH-injected eggs were heavier and larger than control nestlings, but only during the early postnatal period. These differences vanished by fledging. Nestlings from TH-injected eggs exhibited lower activity of the glutathione-s-transferase, a major antioxidant enzyme, than control nestlings at day 12, a few days before fledging, but they did not differ in oxidative damage and overall intracellular oxidative state. These results suggest that the early growth-enhancing effects incurred no observable oxidative stress. We hypothesize that such a transient growth-enhancing effect might be adaptive in advancing the development and maturation of the offspring so they are well-prepared in time for the upcoming migration. Further studies investigating whether such advancing effects can influence long-term fitness, will be more than valuable."

We documented substantial interspecific variation in both absolute and proportional endocrine profiles.

We studied the dynamics of maternal steroids in fertilized and unfertilized rock pigeon eggs during early incubation. Embryos of this species are naturally exposed to different amounts of maternal steroids in the egg according to their laying position, which provides a natural context to study differential embryonic regulation of the maternal signals. We used mass spectrometric analyses to map changes in the androgen and estrogen pathways of conversion. We show that the active hormones are heavily metabolized only in fertilized eggs, with a corresponding increase in supposedly less potent metabolites already within one-fourth of total incubation period. Interestingly, the rate of androgen metabolism was different between embryos in different laying positions. The results also warrant a re-interpretation of the timing of hormone mediated maternal effects and the role of the supposedly biologically inactive metabolites. Furthermore, the results also provide a potential solution as to how the embryo can prevent maternal steroids in the egg from interfering with its sexual differentiation processes as we show that the embryo can metabolize most of the maternal steroids before sexual differentiation starts."

Yet, the influence of maternal stress on offspring phenotype has been little studied in wild animals. We experimentally elevated GCs to ecologically relevant levels (mimicking increases in maternal stress hormones following a nonlethal predator encounter, a heat challenge, or a chasing or confinement stressor) in female eastern fence lizards Sceloporus undulatus during gestation.

In the present study, we sought to better understand maternal stress effects by examining the potential for embryonic regulation of corticosterone exposure, determining the phenotypic consequences of elevated corticosterone during development, and characterizing the levels of maternally transferred corticosterone in unmanipulated eggs using Trachemys scripta. By dosing eggs with tritiated corticosterone and tracking the steroid throughout development, we found that most corticosterone is metabolized, and less than 1\% of the corticosterone dose reaches the embryo as free corticosterone. We also found that exogenous dosing of corticosterone, in concentrations sufficient to overwhelm embryonic metabolism, reduces embryonic survival and negatively impacts hatchling traits important to fitness. Our results demonstrate that concentrations of maternal corticosterone in the yolks of unmanipulated eggs are low and are significantly lower than the doses of corticosterone required to elicit phenotypic effects in hatchlings.

In both types of manipulation we looked at the effects of two groups of hormones: corticosterone and androgens in the form of testosterone and androstenedione. We found that the average effect on offspring traits differed between the manipulation types, with a well-supported positive effect of egg manipulation and lack of a significant effect of maternal manipulation. The observed average positive effect for egg manipulation was driven mainly by androgen manipulations, while corticosterone manipulations exerted no overall effect, regardless of manipulation type. Detailed analyses revealed effects of varying size and direction depending on the specific offspring traits; e.g., egg manipulation positively affected physiology and behaviour (androgens), and negatively affected future reproduction (corticosterone). Effect size was negatively related to the dose of androgen injected into the eggs, but unrelated to timing of manipulation, offspring developmental stage at the time of measuring their traits, solvent type, the site of egg injection and maternal hormone delivery method. Despite the generally acknowledged importance of maternal hormones for offspring development in birds, the overall effect of their experimental elevation is rather weak, significantly heterogeneous and dependent on the hormone and type of manipulation. We conclude by providing general recommendations as to how hormonal manipulations should be performed in order to standardize their impact and the results achieved. We also emphasize the need for research on free-living birds with a focus on fitness-related and other long-term effects of maternal hormones."

Among species, such variation may accomplish different functions, the most obvious of which is camouflage and background matching. Within species, it has been proposed that inter-female variation in eggshell pigmentation patterns can reflect egg, maternal or paternal traits and hence may provide cues to conspecifics about egg, maternal or paternal phenotypic quality. However, the relationship between protoporphyrin-based eggshell pigmentation and egg or maternal/paternal traits appears to be highly variable among species. We investigated patterns of intraspecific variation in Eurasian barn swallow Hirundo r. rustica protoporphyrin-based eggshell pigmentation, and analysed its association with egg and clutch characteristics, maternal/paternal phenotypic traits and parental feeding effort. Eggshell pigmentation pattern significantly varied between breeding colonies, was significantly repeatable in first clutches laid by the same females in different years (intraclass correlation coefficient ranging between 0.56 and 0.63), but it was not significantly associated with egg traits, such as position in the laying sequence, egg mass, yolk testosterone concentration and antioxidant capacity. It was weakly or non-significantly associated with female and male traits (sexual ornaments), but females laying darker (higher pigment intensity) first clutches had higher hatching success, suggesting that eggshell pigment intensity may predict fitness. Male nestling feeding effort was not predicted by eggshell pigmentation. In addition, females with darker breast plumage colouration (a melanin-based trait related to fitness) laid highly protoporphyrin-covered eggs, suggesting the presence of a previously unappreciated link between protoporphyrin biosynthesis and plumage melanisation. Moreover, the proportion of male offspring increased in clutches originating from highly protoporphyrin-covered eggs, suggesting that parents could acquire visual cues about their future brood sex composition before egg hatching. Our results support the idea that intraspecific signalling via eggshell pigmentation is a species-specific rather than a general feature of avian taxa."

Some of these substances even affect the transfer of these compounds in the next generation, but it is less clear how different maternally transmitted compounds interact with each other to shape reproductive resource allocation in their offspring. Here, we found that female Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica) that were exposed to high carotenoid levels during embryonic development transferred lower concentrations of yolk antioxidants to their own eggs later in life. This effect disappeared when both testosterone and carotenoid concentrations were manipulated simultaneously, showing long-term and interactive effects of these maternally derived egg components on a female's own egg composition. Given that exposure to high levels of testosterone during embryo development stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impairs antioxidant defenses, we propose that carotenoids act as in ovo antioxidants in an oxidatively stressful environment (i.e. when levels of testosterone are high) but might have prooxidant properties in an environment where they are not used to counteract an increased production of ROS. In line with this hypothesis, we previously showed that prenatal exposure to increased concentrations of yolk carotenoids leads to a rise of oxidative damage at adulthood, but only when yolk testosterone concentrations were not experimentally increased as well. As a consequence, antioxidants in the body may be used to limit oxidative damage in females exposed to high levels of carotenoids during development (but not in females exposed to increased levels of both carotenoids and testosterone), resulting in lower amounts of antioxidants being available for deposition into eggs. Since prenatal antioxidant exposure is known to influence fitness-related traits, the effect detected in this study might have transgenerational consequences."

We summarize the recent findings, identify knowledge gaps, and provide future research directions investigating the role of TH-mediated maternal effects in ecological context across taxa. Surprisingly, data on the sources of naturally occurring variation in maternal THs and their fitness effects are lacking in most vertebrate taxa. There is considerable variation in maternal TH levels in eggs across taxa. Avian egg THs show heritable variation, and data from fish and amphibians suggest female consistency in egg TH levels. In birds, variation in maternal THs was associated with important ecological factors, such as food availability and temperature. THs also showed intraindividual variation varying systematically within clutches. Importantly, exposure to maternal THs within naturally occurring range affected offspring fitness-related traits (growth and survival) in birds and fish. These findings make THs an interesting mechanism underlying maternal effects, which likely shape offspring phenotypes."

However, deviations from this pattern of maternal testosterone allocation are found, largely in studies of colonial species, and have yet to be explained. Colonial species may have different life-history constraints causing different yolk testosterone allocation strategies in response to conspecific competition, but few studies have experimentally tested whether colonial species do indeed differ from that of solitary species. To test this, we collected eggs from zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata, a colonial species, in the presence and absence of conspecific intrusions. Females did not alter the concentration of testosterone deposited in eggs laid during intrusions despite becoming more aggressive. These results suggest that maternal effects are not characterized by a uniform response to the social environment, but rather need to be contextualized with life-history traits."

We find that parent-offspring conflict strongly influences the stability of maternal effects; moreover, the nature of the disagreement between parents and young predicts how conflict is resolved: when mothers favor less extreme mixtures of phenotypes relative to offspring (i.e., when mothers stand to gain by hedging their bets), mothers win the conflict by providing offspring with limited amounts of information. When offspring favor overproduction of one and the same phenotype across all environments compared to mothers (e.g., when offspring favor a larger body size), neither side wins the conflict and signaling breaks down. Only when offspring favor less extreme mixtures relative to their mothers (something no current model predicts), offspring win the conflict and obtain full information about the environment.

Circulatory profiles of luteinizing hormone (LH), T and estradiol levels were analysed during the last 7 h before ovulation in Japanese quail selected for contrasting yolk T concentrations. Moreover, the pituitary responsiveness to a single challenge with gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) was evaluated. High egg T (HET) birds displayed higher concentrations of LH at 3.5 h before ovulation than low egg T (LET) birds while no differences were found around the time of expected ovulation.

Given the different benefits and costs of investments in sons and daughters, females should adjust the brood sex ratio according to their own quality to maximize their fitness. In the barn swallow Hirundo rustica, as in many other passerines, females should increase the proportion of sons in their broods with increasing maternal body size, because rearing sons is particularly costly to small females with low feeding capacity, and because reproductive success in the barn swallow, which may depend on rearing conditions, varies more in males. However, evidence supporting this prediction is lacking, even in this model species of sex allocation. Using the Asian subspecies of the barn swallow H. r. gutturalis, we confirmed this prediction. Larger mothers with a longer keel had more sons in their brood. We found that male nestlings invested more in pheomelanin pigmentation compared with female nestlings, while they had shorter wing lengths, indicating that male nestlings are costly to rear compared with female nestlings. Smaller mothers that are at a disadvantage in provisioning may not retard the nestling period by producing daughters, which reduces their parental investment and thus saves their residual reproductive value. This breeding strategy might be particularly beneficial to Japanese barn swallows that breed in environments with high nest predation."

In the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis), we increased yolk corticosterone concentration within physiological limits and analyzed the direction of lateralization of hatchlings in reverting from supine to prone position ('RTP' response) and in pecking at dummy parental bills to solicit food provisioning ('begging' response). We found that corticosterone treatment negatively affected the frequency of begging and it may cause a slight leftward lateralization. However, the direction of lateralization of the RTP response was not affected by corticosterone administration. Thus, our study shows a maternal effect mediated by corticosterone on a behavioral trait involved in parent-offspring communication during food provisioning events. The findings on lateralization are not conclusive due to the weak effect size but provide information for further ecological and evolutionary studies, investigating mechanisms underlying the development of lateralization."

We also asked whether maternal hormones take part in the control of sex-specific expression of the genes involved in prenatal development. We experimentally manipulated hormones' concentrations in the egg yolk by injecting zebra finch females prior to ovulation with testosterone or corticosterone. We assessed growth rate and expression levels of CDK7, FBP1 and GHR genes in 37 h-old embryos. We found faster growth and higher expression of two studied genes in male compared to female embryos. Hormonal treatment, despite clearly differentiating egg steroid levels, had no effect on the sex-specific pattern of the embryonic gene expression, even though we confirmed expression of receptors of androgens and glucocorticoids at such an early stage of development.

Using a crossover design, we broadcast low-frequency songs to females either in an overlapping noise condition or in an alternating noise condition. Females decreased both their sexual responsiveness and their clutch size in the overlapping noise treatment relative to the alternative noise treatment.

Due to our experimental design, we can exclude a general impact of noisy conditions and thereby provide evidence for a detrimental effect through masking on avian courtship and reproductive output.

Alternatively, it may be due to an anticipatory maternal effect, wherein some signal or resource is actively placed within the egg, which is beneficial to those eggs laid late within the clutch. In order to distinguish between these hypotheses we designed a supplementary feeding experiment, wherein females were provided with food at certain times during the laying phase. This had no discernible effect on development rate, or other egg characteristics, consistent with anticipatory maternal effects.

However, because females produce the eggs, this might afford females with an ability to manipulate male behavior via maternal effects that alter offspring phenotypes. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated the prenatal conditions (i.e., presence or absence of the male), performed a cross-fostering experiment, and monitored the subsequent effects of prenatal conditions on offspring and parental performance in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. We found that offspring were smaller at hatching when females laid eggs in presence of a male, suggesting that females invest less in eggs when expecting male assistance. Furthermore, broods laid in the presence of a male gained more weight during parental care, and they did so at the expense of male weight gain. Contrary to our expectations, males cared less for broods laid in the presence of a male. Our results provide experimental evidence that females can alter male behavior during breeding by adjusting maternal effects according to prenatal conditions. However, rather than increasing the male's parental effort, females appeared to suppress the male's food consumption, thereby leaving more food for their brood."

Using a variety of methodologies, scientists have quantified maternally derived levels of egg cortisol, the primary glucocorticoid in fishes, and examined the cascading effects of egg cortisol on progeny phenotype. Here we summarize and interpret the current state of knowledge on egg cortisol in fishes and the relationships linking maternal stress/state to egg cortisol and offspring phenotype/fitness.

Outcomes of experimental studies manipulating egg cortisol vary both inter-and intraspecifically. Moreover, while exogenous elevation of egg cortisol (as a proxy for maternal stress) induces phenotypic changes commonly considered to be maladaptive (e.g., smaller offspring size), emerging work in other taxa suggests that there can be positive effects on fitness when the offspring's environment is taken into account. Investigations into (i) mechanisms by which egg cortisol elicits phenotypic change in offspring (e.g., epigenetics), (ii) maternal and offspring buffering capacity of cortisol, and (iii) factors driving natural variation in egg cortisol and how this variation affects offspring phenotype and fitness are all germane to discussions on egg glucocorticoids as signals of maternal stress."

We found that hatching mass was reduced and reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs) levels at the end of the period of maximal growth increased in chicks from eggs injected with either testosterone or carotenoid (only a tendency in chicks from testosterone-injected eggs). However, when both egg compounds were manipulated simultaneously, hatching mass and ROM levels were not affected, showing that both carotenoid and testosterone lose their detrimental effects when the ratio between the 2 compounds is balanced. Our study provides the first experimental evidence for interactive effects of 2 maternally derived egg compounds on offspring phenotype and suggests that developmental cues are tightly coadjusted within an egg."

However, prenatal maternal factors, like yolk testosterone, may also facilitate parent-offspring coadaptation via their effects on offspring begging and development. In fact, maternal effects are thought to adjust offspring phenotype to the environmental conditions they will experience after birth, which are in turn strongly dependent on the levels of parental provisioning. Using cross-fostering experiments in canaries, we tested the role of maternal effects on parent-offspring coadaptation from two different approaches. First, we analyzed whether females deposit yolk testosterone in relation to their own or their partner's prospective parental provisioning, measured as the rate of parental feeding to foster nestlings. Second, we investigated whether females deposit yolk testosterone in relation to costs they incurred when raising a previous brood, as this likely impinges on their capacity to provide parental care in the near future. However, from the results of both experiments we have no evidence that canary females deposit yolk testosterone in order to match offspring begging to the levels of care they and/or their partners provide. We therefore found no evidence that yolk testosterone facilitates parent-offspring coadaptation. In addition, our results suggest that the functional consequences of yolk testosterone deposition may relate to hatching asynchrony since it primarily varied with egg laying order.

In this study, we explored whether variation in yolk androgen concentration affected several measures of the constitutive and cell-mediated immune axes in the spotless starling (Sturnus unicolor). Using a within-brood design, we injected different doses of androgens (testosterone and androstenedione) into the eggs. Our study showed that experimentally increased yolk androgens led to sex-specific immunosuppression in both the innate and adaptive axes of the immune system. Both cell-mediated immune response (CMI) and lysozyme activity decreased with increasing androgen levels injected into the egg in the case of male nestlings, whereas there were no effects on females. The effects that we found were always linear: no quadratic or threshold patterns were detected. We found no effects of the experimental treatment in hemolysis or agglutination capacity, but these measures were negatively correlated with CMI, suggesting negative correlation among different branches of the immune system. Blood (trypanosomes and hemosporidians) and intestinal (coccidia) parasites were not affected by the experimental increase of yolk androgen levels. Our results show that in our study species yolk androgens induce immunosuppression in some axes of the male nestling immune system. Further studies should analyze the proximate causes for these contrasting effects in different axes of the immune system and the reason for the differential impact on males and females."

However, potential fitness consequences of variation of maternal TH exposure within the normal physiological range and without confounding effects of the mother have never been experimentally investigated. We experimentally manipulated the levels of yolk T3 and T4 within the physiological range in a species in which the embryo develops outside the mother's body, the Rock Pigeon (Columba livia) eggs.

Elevated yolk TH levels enhanced embryonic development and hatching success, and reduced body mass but not tarsus length between day 14 and fledging. The yolk hormones increased plasma T4 concentrations in females but reduced it in males, in line with the effect on metabolic rate at hatching. Plasma concentrations of T3 and testosterone were not significantly affected. The effects of treatment did not differ between eggs with high or low testosterone levels.

Using captive Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), we treated eggs with biologically relevant cortisol levels-low (300 ng mL(-1)), high (1,000 ng mL(-1)), or control (0 ng mL(-1))-to examine the early-life impacts of maternally transferred stress hormones on offspring.

Fish reared from high dose eggs were structurally smaller compared to control fish, but despite this variation in structural size, exposure to elevated cortisol did not impact developmental rate. These results demonstrate that elevations in egg cortisol can positively influence offspring fitness through an increase in early survival while also altering phenotype at a critical life-history stage.

We assessed female condition, quantity of egg constituents, quality of diet consumed during egg formation, and nestling growth and survival in two habitats: cultivated farmland and meadows. Egg, albumin, and shell mass were greater at the meadow site, while yolk mass did not differ significantly between sites; albumin mass most strongly predicted egg mass.

Concentration of yolk testosterone was higher at the meadow site and correlated with delta C-13 enrichment in yolk. Nestling survival was higher in the meadow than in the farmland site and corresponded to egg mass and delta C-13 enrichment in lipid-free yolk. Surviving nestlings were larger in the meadow than in the farmland site. Results indicate that agricultural practice influences reproductive output through resource-based maternal effects.

Differences in offspring strategies are generally attributed to hatching order and maternal effects, which are difficult to separate because these effects are often correlated. For example, third-hatched chicks of large gull species receive more egg testosterones and corticosterone, which influence early behavioral patterns. In this study, we carried out a cross-fostering experiment with first-and last-laid eggs of the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) to test whether the within-brood variation in behavioral strategies for competing with siblings and coping with stress are due to maternal effects or to hatching order. Chicks hatched in the last position within the experimental brood emitted more chatter calls to attract parents' attention, were less prone to respond to warning of danger, and had a lower breathing rate while restrained than first-hatched chicks. Egg laying order did not affect chick behaviors or breathing rate. Thus, we concluded that the different behavioral strategies of chicks were determined by their posthatching experience and not by the original egg position within the clutch. Last-laid eggs were smaller and chicks from those eggs grew slower than chicks from first-laid eggs. Independently of the original laying order, chicks that hatched first in the experimental brood grew faster than their siblings. Overall, our results indicate that behavioral strategies of chicks are plastic and influenced by their early social experience."

To this end, inbred birds were weight-matched with outbred birds into duos, and each nest contained one duo of size-advantaged, and one duo of size-disadvantaged inbred and outbred nestlings. Prenatal (maternal) effects were taken into account also, enabling us to study the separate as well as the interactive effects of inbreeding, pre- and postnatal conditions on nestling development. We find that postnatal conditions were the most important determinant of early growth, with size-advantaged nestlings growing faster and obtaining larger size/body mass at fledging in comparison with size-disadvantaged nestlings. Prenatal conditions were important too, with birds that hatched from eggs that were laid late in the laying order obtaining a larger size at fledging than those hatched from early laid eggs. Inbreeding inhibited growth, but surprisingly this did not depend on (dis)advantageous pre- or postnatal conditions.

Nevertheless, not all species show a positive relationship between competitive interactions and yolk testosterone, and an explanation for this interspecific variation is lacking. We here test if the magnitude and direction of maternal testosterone allocated to eggs in response to competition can be explained by life-history traits while accounting for phylogenetic relationships. We performed a meta-analysis relating effect size of yolk testosterone response to competition with species coloniality, nest type, parental effort and mating type. We found that effect size was moderated by coloniality and nest type; colonial species and those with open nests allocate less testosterone to eggs when in more competitive environments.

The objective of this study was to examine the relationships among maternal and egg cortisol, and maternal and offspring oxidative stress to provide insight into the potential intergenerational effects of stressor exposure in sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka).

Here, we test for sex-linked inheritance of a key mediator of prenatal maternal effects in oviparous species, the transfer of maternally derived testosterone to the eggs. Consistent with maternal inheritance, we found that in Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) granddaughters resemble their maternal (but not their paternal) grandmother in yolk testosterone deposition. This pattern of resemblance was not due to non-genetic priming effects of testosterone exposure during prenatal development, as an experimental manipulation of yolk testosterone levels did not affect the females' testosterone transfer to their own eggs later in life.

Longer-term temperature variation could function as a cue, predicting chick rearing conditions to which yolk hormone levels are adjusted, while short-term temperature variation during egg formation may causally affect hormone transfer to eggs. We studied the effects of ambient temperature on yolk androgens (testosterone and androstenedione) and thyroid hormones (thyroxine and triiodothyronine) in great tits (Parus major) using data from unmanipulated clutches from a wild population and from aviary birds (ad libitum food) exposed to different experimental temperature treatments during five years. Both in the wild and in captivity, longer-term pre-laying ambient temperature was not associated with clutch mean yolk hormone levels, while the way androstenedione and thyroxine levels varied across the laying sequence did associate with pre-laying temperature in the wild. Yolk testosterone levels were positively correlated with short-term temperature (during yolk formation) changes within clutches in both wild and captivity. We also report, for the first time in a wild bird, that yolk thyroxine levels correlated with a key environmental factor: thyroxine levels were negatively correlated with ambient temperature during egg formation. Thus, yolk hormone levels, especially testosterone, seem to be causally affected by ambient temperature. These short-term effects might reflect physiological changes in females with changes in ambient temperature.

In this study, we increased CORT levels in the egg albumen of a wild passerine, the great tit (Parus major), breeding in favourable deciduous and less suitable coniferous habitat. Subsequently we measured the somatic growth, baseline and acute glucocorticoid responses, immunity and behaviour of prenatally manipulated offspring with respect to control siblings. We found that prenatally CORT-exposed nestlings had lower baseline CORT levels, a more rapid decline in CORT during recovery from a standardized stressor, and a reduced heterophil/lymphocyte ratio compared with controls. Although stress -induced total CORT levels remained unchanged, free CORT levels were significantly lower and the levels of corticosteroid binding globulins (CBG) significantly higher in experimental offspring. Prenatally CORT-exposed offspring begged longer after hatching than controls. Stress induced behavioural activity of fledglings did not differ between treatments, while its association with baseline CORT levels was significant in the control group only.

Here, parental basking opportunity was manipulated in an oviparous lizard with temperature-dependent sex determination, the jacky dragon (Amphibolurus muricatus). Eggs were incubated at a temperature that typically produces a 50: 50 sex ratio, and hatchlings were reared in a standard thermal environment. Offspring of parents in short bask conditions appeared to have better fitness outcomes in captive conditions than those of parents in long bask conditions -they had greater growth and survival as a function of their mass. In addition, the sex of offspring (male or female) depended on the interaction between parental treatment and egg mass, and treatment impacted whether sons or daughters grew larger in their first season. The interactive effects of treatment on offspring sex and growth are consistent with adaptive explanations for the existence of temperature-dependent sex determination in this species.

Some studies have demonstrated that maternal yolk testosterone (T) can have long-lasting effects into the period after fledging. However, these results are based on offspring in the juvenile stage or their first breeding season only. The lack of data further into adulthood limits a better assessment of the fitness consequences of prenatal T. In a series of previous experiments in the rock pigeon, Columba livia, we manipulated yolk T levels using oil-injected eggs as controls. In the present study, we examined the reproductive behaviour of birds from these eggs when they were 1-3 years old and housed together in a large aviary. Our results showed that males from T-injected eggs were less aggressive and females from T-injected eggs laid lighter eggs than controls. Moreover, the experimental birds showed strongly disassortative mating with respect to hormone treatment. There were no indications of treatment effects on the process of sexual differentiation. Our results indicate that the effects of prenatal T do not diminish over age and may last far into adulthood, which should be taken into account in assessing the fitness consequences of maternal hormones. They may also stimulate new physiological and neurobiological studies on the mechanisms underlying such long-lasting effects of prenatal T exposure.

To date, no study has determined the mechanisms mediating this maternal effect's influence on offspring phenotype. However, levels of estrogen receptor alpha (ER) gene expression are linked to differences in early growth and aggression; thus, maternal hormones may alter gene regulation, perhaps via DNA methylation, of ER in offspring during prenatal development. We performed a pilot study to examine natural variation in testosterone allocation to offspring through egg yolks in wild Eastern Bluebirds (Sialia sialis) in varying breeding densities and percent DNA methylation of CG dinucleotides in the ER promoter in offspring brain regions associated with growth and behavior. We hypothesized that breeding density would be positively correlated with yolk testosterone, and prenatal exposure to maternal-derived yolk testosterone would be associated with greater offspring growth and decreased ER promoter methylation. Yolk testosterone concentration was positively correlated with breeding density, nestling growth rate, and percent DNA methylation of one out of five investigated CpG sites (site 3) in the diencephalon ER promoter, but none in the telencephalon (n=10). Percent DNA methylation of diencephalon CpG site 3 was positively correlated with growth rate. These data suggest a possible role for epigenetics in mediating the effects of the maternal environment on offspring phenotype. Experimentally examining this mechanism with a larger sample size in future studies may help elucidate a prominent way in which animals respond to their environment. Further, by determining the mechanisms that mediate maternal effects, we can begin to understand the potential for the heritability of these mechanisms and the impact that maternal effects are capable of producing at an evolutionary scale."

Various environmental insults, such as a food shortages, predation attempts, and agonistic encounters often elevate plasma glucocorticoid levels in vertebrates. Because exposure to maternally-derived (via circulation or egg) glucocorticoids may be detrimental to the developing embryo, maternal stress can have negative carryover effects on offspring fitness. We examined corticosterone, the primary avian glucocorticoid, concentrations in egg yolk in a plural-breeding, joint-nesting species, the smooth-billed ani (Crotophaga ani), in which females compete among themselves to lay eggs in the final incubated clutch. We investigated whether yolk corticosterone levels varied with laying order and group size. Because egg-laying competition leads to physiological and social stress that is intensified with group size and laying order, we predicted that yolk corticosterone levels should increase from the early to the late egg-laying period and from single female to multi-female groups. In this two-year field study, we found that yolk corticosterone levels of late-laid eggs within the communal clutch were higher in multi-female groups than in single female groups. Results from this study suggest that laying females experience higher levels of stress in multi-female groups and that this maternal stress influences yolk corticosterone concentrations.

We thus expect maternal compensation to follow a bell-shaped pattern in relation to environmental conditions. We studied a black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) population where previous results revealed increased allocation of yolk testosterone in younger as compared to older chicks in intermediate conditions, in line with our theoretical framework. We therefore predicted a maternally induced increase in aggressiveness, growth, and survival for younger chicks born in intermediate environmental conditions. Controlling for parental effects and chick sex, we manipulated food availability before egg laying to create a situation with intermediate (Unfed group) and good (Fed group) environmental conditions. Within each feeding treatment, we further created experimental broods where the natural hatching order was reversed to maximize our chances to observe an effect of feeding treatment on the younger chicks' aggressiveness. As predicted, we found that chick aggressiveness was higher in younger chicks born from the Unfed group (i.e., in intermediate environmental conditions), but only when they were put in a senior position, in reversed broods. Predictions on growth and survival were not confirmed. Mothers thus seem to favor the competitiveness of their younger chick in intermediate conditions via egg yolk components, but our study also suggests that hatching asynchrony need to be small for maternal compensation to be efficient.

We studied, for the first time in a wild species and population, the effects of maternally derived THs on offspring development, behavior, physiology and fitness-related traits by experimental elevation of thyroxine and triiodothyronine in ovo within the physiological range in great tits (Parus major).

Hatching or fledging success, motor coordination behavior, stress reactivity and resting metabolic rate were not affected by the TH treatment. We conclude that natural variation in maternally derived THs may affect some offspring traits in a wild species.

We show that empirical studies on the role of maternal androgens in birds with biparental care provide no support for female manipulation of male care. However, we argue that it would be premature to conclude that maternal androgens play no role in female manipulation of male care given methodological problems in previous work. We then identify a number of additional mechanisms by which females may manipulate male care, including egg components other than androgens, egg size, and egg coloration. We show that there is good evidence that egg coloration affects male care, suggesting that this mechanism warrants further research. We also highlight that current evidence is derived from studies using experimental design that target specific candidate mechanisms, such as maternal androgens. Given the multitude of candidate mechanisms, we discuss an alternative approach based on targeting ecologically relevant prenatal conditions, such as food availability, and monitoring subsequent effects on candidate mechanisms, offspring phenotypes, and male and female care.

Well-established sex-dependence in androgen physiology and sex-dependent variation in lateralization have led to the hypothesis that testosterone (T) has organizational effects on lateralization. The effects of T exposure in early life on lateralization can be efficiently investigated by manipulating T levels in the cleidoic eggs of birds, because the embryo is isolated from maternal and sibling physiological interference, but this approach has been adopted very rarely. In the yellow-legged gull (Laws michahellis) we increased yolk T concentration within the physiological limits and tested the effects on the direction of lateralization in two functionally fundamental behaviors (begging for parental care and escape to cover) of molecularly sexed hatchlings. We also speculated that T may intervene in regulating consistency, rather than direction of lateralization, and therefore tested if T affected the `repeatability' of lateral preference in consecutive behavioral trials. T treatment had no effect on the direction of lateralization, but enhanced the consistency of lateral preference in escape responses. Sex did not predict lateralization. Neither behavior was lateralized at the population-level. We therefore showed for the first time in any species an effect of egg T on consistency in lateralization. The implications of the effect of T for the evolution of trade-offs in maternal allocation of egg hormones, and the evolutionary interpretations of findings from our studies on lateralization among unmanipulated birds are discussed.

A recently revised version of the DAH makes explicit that investment can be positive, i.e. higher for the offspring of attractive males which should be of higher quality, or negative, i.e. higher for offspring of unattractive males, for example compensating for inheriting poor paternal genes. Moreover, investment can be made by the father and the mother. Here, we tested whether experimental manipulation of male attractiveness affected parental investment at different reproductive stages and thus influenced fitness-related traits in offspring. In two aviaries, all male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, were given red leg rings to increase attractiveness and in two aviaries all males received green leg rings to decrease attractiveness. This controlled for assortative mating between treatments. Ring colour was merely an experimental manipulation of male attractiveness, not paternal quality, so we might expect additional investment to elevate offspring quality. Eggs were cross-fostered between and within treatments to allow differentiation of effects of investment in eggs and nestlings. Clutch and brood sizes were standardized. Both positive and negative investment were observed: Eggs from red-ringed fathers had higher yolk to albumen ratios than eggs from green-ringed fathers. Nestlings from eggs laid and incubated by parents in the red-ringed group had higher hatching masses than those in the green-ringed group. Both parents in the green-ringed group fed nestlings more frequently than red-ringed parents. Offspring performance was influenced by the treatment of both foster and biological parents, but combined effects of these different investment patterns on fitness-related traits were ambiguous.

Mothers may adjust different egg components in different ways in reaction to environmental cues either to adjust offspring development or because of constraints. In this study, we investigated the effects of food quality and quantity before and during egg laying on three different aspects of egg quality: macro-nutrients (egg and yolk mass), androgens (testosterone and androstenedione), and thyroid hormones (3,5,3-triiodothyronine, T3 and l-thyroxine, T4), using the rock pigeon (Columba livia). As expected, egg and yolk mass were significantly reduced for the eggs laid under the poor-food condition, indicating a maternal trade-off between offspring and self in allocating important resources. We did not find any significant change in yolk testosterone or their within-clutch pattern over the laying sequence. This is consistent with the fact that, in contrast with nutrients, these hormones are not costly to produce, but does not support the hypothesis that they play a role in adjusting brood size to food conditions. In contrast, we found that T3 levels were higher in the egg yolks under the poor-food condition whereas the total T4 content was lower. This change could be related to the fact that iodine, the critical constituent of thyroid hormones, might be a limiting factor in the production of this hormone. Given the knowledge that food restriction usually lead to reduction of circulating T3 levels, our results suggested that avian mothers can independently regulate its concentrations in their eggs from their own circulation. The study demonstrates that environmentally induced maternal effects via the egg can be a result of a combination of constrained resources and unconstrained signals and that thyroid hormones might be an interesting case of both. Therefore, this hormone and the interplay of different maternal effects on the offspring phenotype deserve much more attention."

Yolk androgen and thyroid hormone levels were not affected by food supplementation during laying. Thyroxine showed an increase over the laying sequence and its biological meaning needs further study. The rapid changes in egg mass to variation in within-clutch food availability suggest energetic/protein/nutrient constrains on egg formation. The lack of a response in yolk hormones suggest that perhaps in this species the short-term changes in resource availability during egg laying do not predict offspring rearing conditions, or (for thyroid hormones) do not cause systemic changes in circulating hormones, and hence do not affect maternal signaling."

Androgen hormones in bird eggs have attracted considerable interest in past years, and it is frequently assumed that their concentrations in eggs are shaped by Darwinian selection. Currently, however, the data is scattered over species with very different life-history strategies, environments and selection pressures, making it difficult to draw any firm conclusions as to their functional significance for a given system. I review the evidence available as to the function, variation and potential adaptive value of yolk androgens (testosterone, T and androstenedione, A4) using one well-studied wild bird model system, the European flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca and Ficedula albicollis. These species both show genetic and environmental variation in yolk androgen levels, along with fitness correlations for the female, suggesting the potential for selection. However, variation in yolk T and A4 seem to be differentially affected, suggesting that maternal constraints/costs shape the transfer of the yolk steroids differently. Most of the environmental variation is consistent with the idea of high yolk androgen levels under poor rearing conditions, although the effect sizes in relation to environmental variation are rather small in relation to genetic among-female variation. Importantly, within-clutch patterns too vary in relation to environmental conditions. Yolk androgens seem to have multiple short- and long-term effects on phenotype and behavior; importantly, they are also correlated with the fitness of offspring and mothers. However, the effects are often sex-dependent, and not universally beneficial for the offspring. Unfortunately, conclusive data as to the adaptive benefits of clutch mean androgen levels or within clutch-patterns in different environmental conditions is still lacking. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In this study we aimed to investigate how the badge size of male house sparrows (Passer domesticus) is correlated to avian malaria infections as well as to prenatal testosterone exposure, measured as the 2D:4D digit ratio. The rationale behind this study is that the immunosuppressive effect of maternal testosterone deposition combined with the fitness cost imposed by parasites may cause important trade-offs to the development of secondary sexual signals. Methods: Assuming that vector abundance is a key variable associated with infection risk by avian malaria, we caught adult male sparrows from eight different populations in the Camargue, France, four of which were located in a vector-controlled area, and the other four in an untreated area. For each bird we measured its badge size, digit ratio and took blood to determine its infections status. We used PCR to identify the malaria parasite species and strain that caused the infection. Results: Contrary to our expectation, prevalence of disease did not differ across the vector-treatment regions, with around 80 \% of birds being infected in both areas, and those infections were caused largely by a single strain, Plasmodium relictum SGS1. Although infected birds had a badge size not significantly different from uninfected males, there was a condition-dependent association between badge size, infection status and maternal testosterone deposition. Conclusions: This study illustrates that the complexity of temporal and ecological dimensions makes the relationships between disease, testosterone-related traits and secondary sexual signals that have been previously reported less general than thought."

Here we investigated whether the melanin-based breast-band of male and female Bar-throated Apalis Apalis thoracica is a signal of information about its bearer and is associated with male and female reproductive effort. Breast-band size was a highly variable morphometric trait in both sexes, but only in males was it associated with body mass. We then assessed whether male and female breast-band size predicted maternal and paternal investment. Egg mass increased with male breast-band size, but decreased with female breast-band size. Whether females adjust maternal hormone allocation in response to their partner's ornamentation remains a contentious issue. We found that yolk testosterone and androstenedione concentrations were not predicted by male ornamentation or body mass. Finally, males with larger breast-bands provided their mates with more food, allowing those females to spend more time incubating. Reproductive effort of both parents is therefore predicted by their own and their mate's ornamentation in Bar-throated Apalis, and thus breast-band size potentially acts as a signal of reproductive performance in both sexes. These results highlight the need for more comprehensive analyses of a relationship between melanin-based ornaments and fitness, incorporating multiple behavioural variables associated with reproductive effort."

Here, we tested the effect of injecting a physiological dose of vitamin E in the egg yolk on chick body size at hatching by comparison with chicks from sham-injected eggs. As predicted, chicks from vitamin E injected third eggs were larger than chicks from control third eggs, whereas vitamin E had no effect on chicks from the other eggs. Thus, vitamin E injection disrupted the brood size hierarchy according to laying order normally found in this species. In species that adopt a brood reduction strategy, differential allocation of vitamin E to the eggs can contribute to establish a hierarchy of reproductive value among progeny members functioning to maximize parental fitness. The present results therefore have general implications for the study of the evolution of maternal effects mediated by transfer of potentially limiting maternal antioxidants to the eggs."

It has been hypothesized that mothers may be able to create a steroid environment that adjusts the phenotypes of offspring to current environmental conditions. Complicating this hypothesis is the potential for developing embryos to modulate their early endocrine environment. This study utilized the threespined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) to characterize the early endocrine environment within eggs by measuring four steroids (progesterone, testosterone, estradiol, and cortisol) of maternal origin. We then examined how the concentrations of these four steroids changed over the first 12 days post fertilization (dpf). Progesterone, testosterone, estradiol, and cortisol of maternal origin could be detected within unfertilized eggs and levels of all four steroids declined in the first 3 days following fertilization. While levels of progesterone, testosterone, and estradiol remained low after the initial decline, levels of cortisol rose again by 8dpf. These results demonstrate that G. aculeatus embryos begin development in the presence of a number of maternal steroids but levels begin to change quickly following fertilization. This suggests that embryonic processes change the early endocrine environment and hence influence the ability of maternal steroids to affect development. With these findings, G. aculeatus becomes an intriguing system in which to study how selection may act on both maternal and embryonic processes to shape the evolutionary consequence of steroid-mediated maternal effects.

The balance between costs and benefits of androgen allocation is expected to depend on nestling environment. We tested this hypothesis in a multibrooded passerine, the spotless starling, Sturnus unicolor. We experimentally manipulated yolk androgen levels using a between-brood design and evaluated its effects on nestling development, survival and immune function. Both in first and replacement broods, the embryonic development period was shorter for androgen-treated chicks than controls, but there were no differences in second broods. In replacement broods, androgen-treated chicks were heavier and larger than those hatched from control eggs, but this effect was not observed in the other breeding attempts. Androgen exposure reduced survival with respect to controls only in second broods. Regarding immune function, we detected nonsignificant trends for androgen treatment to activate two important components of innate and adaptive immunity (IL-6 and Ig-A levels, respectively). Similarly, androgen-treated chicks showed greater lymphocyte proliferation than controls in the first brood and an opposite trend in the second brood. Our results indicate that yolk androgen effects on nestling development and immunity depend on the environmental conditions of each breeding attempt. Variation in maternal androgen allocation to eggs could be explained as the result of context-dependent optimal strategies to maximize offspring fitness."

To examine possible complex dose-response effects of maternal androgens on chick development, we experimentally administered three different androgen doses of the naturally occurring mixture of yolk testosterone and androstenedione to spotless starling eggs (Sturnus unicolor).

Here, we report on the evolutionary consequences of differences in maternal acquisition and allocation of amino acids to eggs. We manipulated acquisition by varying maternal diet (milkweed or sunflower) in the large milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus. Variation in allocation was detected by examining two source populations with different evolutionary histories and life-history response to sunflower as food. We measured amino acids composition in eggs in this 2x2 design and found significant effects of source population and maternal diet on egg and nymph mass and of source population, maternal diet, and their interaction on amino acid composition of eggs. We measured significant linear and quadratic maternal selection on offspring mass associated with variation in amino acid allocation. Visualizing the performance surface along the major axes of nonlinear selection and plotting the mean amino acid profile of eggs from each treatment onto the surface revealed a saddle-shaped fitness surface. While maternal selection appears to have influenced how females allocate amino acids, this maternal effect did not evolve equally in the two populations. Furthermore, none of the population means coincided with peak performance. Thus, we found that the composition of free amino acids in eggs was due to variation in both acquisition and allocation, which had significant fitness effects and created selection. However, although there can be an evolutionary response to novel food resources, females may be constrained from reaching phenotypic optima with regard to allocation of free amino acids."

In fish, it is unknown how maternal oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity influence offspring quality. The semelparous, migratory life history of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) provides a unique opportunity to explore intergenerational effects of oxidative stress. This study examined the effects of population origin on maternal and developing offspring oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity, and elucidated intergenerational relationships among populations of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) with varying migration effort. For three geographically distinct populations of Fraser River sockeye salmon (British Columbia, Canada), antioxidant capacity and oxidative stress were measured in adult female plasma, heart, brain, and liver, as well as in developing offspring until time of emergence. Maternal and offspring oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity varied among populations but patterns were not consistent across tissue/developmental stage. Furthermore, maternal oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity did not affect offspring oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity across any of the developmental stages or populations sampled. Our results revealed that offspring develop their endogenous antioxidant systems at varying rates across populations; however, this variability is overcome by the time of emergence.

Differential allocation of maternal resources, in terms of egg weight and yolk composition, may therefore allow the female to adjust brood reduction and to fine-tune reproductive investment in accordance with the expected fitness returns. The adaptive value of such maternal resource allocation is thought to be context-dependent as well as species-specific. We investigated the effects of female preference for her mate on the allocation of prenatal maternal resources in the budgerigar, Melopsittacus undulatus, a monogamous species of parrot that shows an extreme hatching asynchrony. We assessed mate preferences in a two-way preference test and allowed females two breeding rounds: one with the preferred and one with the non-preferred partner. We found no effect of preference on either latency to lay or clutch size, but females mated with the preferred partner laid eggs that contained significantly more yolk. Their eggs also contained significantly more androstenedione but not testosterone. Our results suggest that in this species, female preference may influence maternal resource allocation, and that the functional roles of each androgen in the yolk should be considered separately. In addition, we found a significant effect of laying order on egg and yolk weight as well as on yolk testosterone and androstenedione levels. These measures, however, did not change linearly with the laying order and render it unlikely that female budgerigars compensate for the extreme hatching asynchrony by adjusting within-clutch allocation of prenatal maternal resources.

The social environment is part of the prenatal environment; however, its influence on maternal allocation has been poorly investigated and experimental tests linking prenatal conditions to begging behaviour have seldom been conducted. In cooperative breeders the presence of additional carers, the helpers, generally predicts an increase in provisioning during the nestling stage. Since begging is costly, in these species producing offspring that beg less in the presence of helpers may be a way of saving energy not only for the offspring but also for the future survival and reproduction of females. To date, whether mothers may manipulate begging behaviour in relation to helper presence is unstudied. We conducted a cross-fostering experiment in a cooperatively breeding bird, the sociable weaver, Philetairus socius, to disentangle the possible effects of prenatal and postnatal environments on begging behaviour. Pre- and postnatal environments correspond here to the number of carers in the nest of origin and the foster nest, respectively. As predicted, begging was influenced by the prenatal environment, with nestlings originally from larger groups begging less. In addition, chicks fed by more foster birds also begged at a lower rate. We conclude that the prenatal environment influences begging behaviour. This result has important implications for understanding cooperative breeding strategies since producing offspring that beg less with more helpers may allow energy savings for females and related offspring and helpers.

In the present study, we investigated genetically determined variability and mutually adjusted deposition of sex hormones (testosterone-T, androstenedione-A(4) and progesterone-P-4), antibodies (IgY) and antimicrobial proteins (lysozyme) in eggs of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica). We used different genetic lines that were independently selected for yolk T concentrations, duration of tonic immobility and social reinstatement behaviour, since both selections for behavioural traits (fearfulness and social motivation, respectively) produced considerable correlative responses in yolk androgen levels. A higher selection potential was found for increased rather than decreased yolk T concentrations, suggesting that there is a physiological minimum in egg T levels. Line differences in yolk IgY concentrations were manifested within each selection experiment, but no consistent inter-line pattern between yolk IgY and T was revealed. On the other hand, a consistent inverse inter-line pattern was recorded between yolk IgY and P-4 in both selections for behavioural traits. In addition, selections for contrasting fearfulness and social motivation were associated with changes in albumen lysozyme concentrations and an inverse inter-line pattern between the deposition of yolk IgY and albumen lysozyme was found in lines selected for the level of social motivation. Thus, our results demonstrate genetically-driven changes in deposition of yolk T, P-4, antibodies and albumen lysozyme in the egg. This genetic variability can partially explain mutually adjusted maternal deposition of sex hormones and immune-competent molecules but the inconsistent pattern of inter-line differences across all selections indicates that there are other underlying mechanisms, which require further studies."

Here, we test how prenatal maternal effects and postnatal conditions interact in influencing offspring growth and development in wild-living great tits (Parus major) by manipulating food availability experienced by the mother before egg laying, partially cross-fostering nestlings between nests, and manipulating food availability after hatching. We observed significant interaction effects between pre- and postnatal food conditions. Nonsupplemented nestlings reached a similar fledging mass, a trait closely linked to postfledging survival, as food-supplemented nestlings when their biological mother had received extra food during egg laying. It shows that prenatal maternal investment can compensate for growth-limiting conditions after hatching. This effect was sex specific, with daughters benefiting more than sons. Furthermore, food-supplemented nestlings grew largest when their biological mother had not received extra food during egg laying, suggesting that offspring were primed prenatally, possibly through differential egg composition, to use resources more efficiently. However, we found no evidence that offspring performed generally better when pre- and postnatal food conditions matched than when a mismatch occurred. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering the postnatal environment when testing for the ecological and evolutionary consequences of prenatal maternal effects in natural populations.Resources transferred by the bird mother via the egg help to reduce the negative consequences of a harsh environment after birth.

Egg antibody concentration increased with maternal plumage darkness in broods with relatively more females, whereas it decreased in broods with relatively more males. Thus, darker females allocated more antibodies to their eggs when offspring sex ratio was female biased, whereas paler females allocated more antibodies to the eggs when offspring sex ratio was male biased.

Such maternal effects also allow young that may be exposed to disease in early life to focus resources on growth and development at this critical period of development. Maternally transferred antibodies are therefore an important source of phenotypic variation in host phenotype as well as influencing host susceptibility and tolerance to infection across generations. It has previously been assumed the transfer of antibodies is passive and invariant and reflects the level of circulating antibody in the mother at the time of transfer. However, whether females may vary in the relative amount of protection transferred to offspring has seldom been explored. Results: Here we show that females differ widely in the relative amount of specific blood antibodies they transfer to the embryonic environment (range 9.2\%-38.4\% of their own circulating levels) in Chinese painted quail (Coturnix chinensis). Relative transfer levels were unrelated to the size of a female's own immune response. Furthermore, individual females were consistent in their transfer level, both across different stages of their immune response and when challenged with different vaccine types. The amount of antibody transferred was related to female condition, but baseline antibody responses of mothers were not. However, we found no evidence for any trade-offs between the relative amount of antibody transferred with other measures of reproductive investment. Conclusions: These results suggest that the relative amount of antibodies transferred to offspring can vary significantly and consistently between females. Levels of transfer may therefore be a separate trait open to manipulation or selection with potential consequences for offspring health and fitness in both wild and domesticated populations."

Such mothers would suffer a total loss of fitness if offspring cannot survive past multiple life stages. We evaluated whether chronic exposure of female sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) to a chase stressor impaired offspring performance traits. Egg size and early offspring survival were not influenced by maternal exposure to the repeated acute stressor. Later in development, fry reared from stressed mothers swam for shorter periods of time but possessed a superior capacity to re-initiate bouts of burst swimming. In contrast to iteroparous species, the mechanisms driving the observed effects do not appear to be related to cortisol, as egg hormone concentrations did not vary between stressed and undisturbed mothers. Sockeye salmon appear to possess buffering strategies that protect offspring from deleterious effects of maternal stress that would otherwise compromise progeny during highly vulnerable stages of development. Whether stressed sockeye salmon mothers endow offspring with traits that are matched or mismatched for survival in the unpredictable environment they encountered is discussed. This study highlights the importance of examining intergenerational effects among species-specific reproductive strategies, and across offspring life history to fully determine the scope of impact of maternal stress."

Furthermore, female egg investment varies in relation to male song characteristics. Interestingly, clutch size, egg weight, or size, which can be considered as an high-cost investment, is not influenced by male song characteristics, whereas comparably low-cost investment types like investment into diverse egg components are adjusted to male song characteristics.

Although yolk corticosterone concentrations were not affected by the treatment, offspring from treated mothers were less responsive to social isolation in a novel environment compared to control offspring. This is, to our knowledge, the first study demonstrating that maternal re-pairing prior to hatching has long-lasting effects on offspring phenotype in a socially monogamous and biparental species. Our results also suggest that prehatching maternal effects of this social disturbance are not mediated by maternal yolk corticosterone. Additional studies are required to determine the potential pathways of these maternal effects (e. g. other hormones, epigenetic programming, protein/nutrient content of eggs, etc.) and their adaptive value.

Because different egg components can have opposite effects on offspring phenotype, selection is expected to favour their mutual adjustment, resulting in a significant covariation between egg components within and/or among clutches. Here we tested for such correlations between maternally derived yolk immunoglobulins and yolk androgens in great tit (Parus major) eggs using a multivariate mixed-model approach. We found no association between yolk immunoglobulins and yolk androgens within clutches, indicating that within clutches the two egg components are deposited independently. Across clutches, however, there was a significant negative relationship between yolk immunoglobulins and yolk androgens, suggesting that selection has co-adjusted their deposition. Furthermore, an experimental manipulation of ectoparasite load affected patterns of covariance among egg components. Yolk immunoglobulins are known to play an important role in nestling immune defence shortly after hatching, whereas yolk androgens, although having growth-enhancing effects under many environmental conditions, can be immunosuppressive. We therefore speculate that variation in the risk of parasitism may play an important role in shaping optimal egg composition and may lead to the observed pattern of yolk immunoglobulin and yolk androgen deposition across clutches. More generally, our case study exemplifies how multivariate mixed-model methodology presents a flexible tool to not only quantify, but also test patterns of (co)variation across different organisational levels and environments, allowing for powerful hypothesis testing in ecophysiology."

Here, we investigate whether egg T exposure affected adult male circulating T levels at the onset of the breeding season (reflecting gonadal maturation), and the relationship between circulating T and male traits. Egg T exposure did not affect pre-mating plasma T. T levels were not associated with the expression of secondary sexual and non-sexual traits or socio-sexual behaviour (social rank, overall fighting ability and mating success). However, wattle brightness decreased with increasing circulating T in males hatched from T-eggs (T-males) but not among control males. In dyadic encounters during the peak mating period, control males with higher pre-mating T levels had higher chances of being dominant over other control males. However, higher pre-mating T levels did not predict success in male-male competition in encounters involving T-males. We suggest that the long-term effects of egg T on male phenotype do not originate from differential gonadal maturation according to egg T treatment. Rather, prenatal androgens may have priming effects on functioning of target tissues, translating into differential phenotypic effects according to androgen exposure during embryonic development."

We tested the effects of yolk testosterone on the plasma testosterone levels and the sensitivity to testosterone in 5 months old male canaries that hatched from eggs that were either injected with testosterone (yT-males) or with a control solution (yC-males). Changes in sensitivity were investigated via the behavioural response to an experimental elevation of the plasma testosterone levels. We performed the experiment in fall (low endogenous testosterone production), focusing on testosterone dependent response traits (aggression and song). Before implantation, there was a non-significant trend that the plasma testosterone levels were lower in yT-males than in yC-males. Elevating the plasma testosterone concentrations increased aggressiveness, song bout length and similarity of repeated song elements (=consistency), with the latter likely being a consequence of testosterone-driven song crystallization. However, these effects were not different among yT- or yC-males in any of the parameters. Thus, our findings render it unlikely that changes in the sensitivity to testosterone post-hatching would form the main underlying mechanism of hormonemediated maternal effects in birds.

However, yolk A4 is deposited in substantially higher concentrations than T, binds only weakly to the androgen receptor, and is readily converted into either T or estrone by steroidogenic enzymes present during embryonic development. Thus it may not be appropriate to assume that A4 has the same effect as T. In addition, A4's metabolic fate is likely to differ between females and males. The goals of this study were to examine the sex-specific uptake and metabolism of yolk A4 and consequences of elevated levels of yolk A4 on development and behavior of domestic chicks. Eggs were injected with 2 mu Ci of tritiated androstenedione; radioactivity was detected in all tissues of day 7 and day 16 embryos and found in both aqueous and organics phases of day 7 yolk, with no difference between sexes.

All other things being equal, the differential pattern of development across the clutch may contribute to hatching asynchrony and subsequent inequity in the competition between brood mates, and ultimately increase variance in the quality and fitness of first- and last-laid offspring. It has been suggested that females might allocate resources differently across the laying sequence to moderate the developmental rate and hatching time of different embryos. We tested this theory in the Zebra Finch Taeniopygia guttata, a common model species for investigating maternal effects in birds. We removed 758 eggs from 160 nests shortly after they were laid and used artificial incubators to control for parental effects and monitor hatching times. Eggs from larger clutches consistently hatched sooner than those from average-sized clutches, demonstrating that the intrinsic properties of an egg can alter the developmental time of embryos. There were also differences in the development time of eggs across the laying sequence, but these patterns were weaker, inconsistent and unrelated to sequential investment across the laying sequence in a straightforward way. This study indicates that maternal resource allocation to eggs across the laying sequence and across clutch sizes can influence development times and play a potentially important role in determining the competitive dynamics of broods."

However, few studies provide an environmental context with which to examine the potential adaptive benefits of these phenotypic changes. In this study, tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) breeding density was altered to modify levels of social competition and yolk testosterone. We measured nestling growth, competitive ability, and breathing rate in response to a stressor using a partial cross-foster design. Females breeding at high-density experienced more aggressive, competitive interactions and their eggs had higher testosterone concentrations. Nestlings that hatched in high-density environments grew faster and displayed more competitive behaviors and a higher breathing rate response to a stressor regardless of post-hatching density. Our study demonstrates that phenotypic plasticity occurs in response to yolk testosterone variation resulting from different breeding densities. These findings suggest that naturally-induced maternal effects prepare offspring for competitive environments, supporting the idea that maternal effects are adaptive. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Interestingly, total clutch provisioning did not vary with male quality. We show for the first time that females vary intra-clutch variation in resource allocation according to male quality.

We found that broods of both domesticated and wild birds taken into captivity hatched more asynchronously than wild free-living broods. This was directly attributable to both male and female parents of domesticated and captive wild broods initiating incubation as soon as the first egg was laid as opposed to when the clutch was virtually complete in wild free-living broods. Wild free-living birds that were transferred to captive environments immediately switched to the incubation onset behaviour seen in domesticated birds, thereby demonstrating a previously unsuspected level of intraspecific plasticity in incubation behaviour. This finding suggests that something about the captive environment is driving the early onset of incubation and contributing to an elevated level of hatching asynchrony in captive birds.

Then we investigated the effect of yolk testosterone on chicks' begging by experimentally increasing yolk testosterone levels. Our results revealed that yolk testosterone has a component-specific effect on chicks' begging, specifically increasing the number of chatter calls. Parental feeding effort was influenced by the number of chatter calls emitted by chicks, but most importantly, the influence was stronger in male than in female parents.

Differential transfer of maternal androgens is one potential proximate mechanism through which female birds may facilitate brood reduction because it may alter the relative competitive ability of sibling nestlings. We tested the hypothesis that female collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) manipulate sibling competition by transferring less androgens to eggs late in the laying sequence. We experimentally elevated androgen levels in i) whole clutches and ii) only the two last laid eggs, and compared growth and begging behavior of offspring from these treatments with a control treatment. By using three treatments and video assessment of begging, we examined the effects of within-clutch patterns of yolk androgen transfer on levels of sibling competition in situ. When androgens were elevated in only the two last laid eggs, begging was more even among siblings compared to control nests. We also found that female nestlings receiving additional yolk androgens showed higher mass gain later in the breeding season, while their male counterparts did not. Our results suggest that females may improve reproductive success in unpredictable environments by altering within-clutch patterns of yolk androgen transfer.

Surprisingly, few studies have examined the effect of this variation in male and female life history on the evolution of care. Here, we use a theoretical approach to determine the sex-specific life-history characteristics that give rise to the origin of paternal, maternal, or bi-parental care from an ancestral state of no care. Females initially invest more into each egg than males. Despite this inherent difference between the sexes, paternal, maternal, and bi-parental care are equally likely when males and females are otherwise similar. Thus, sex differences in initial zygotic investment do not explain the origin of one pattern of care over another. However, sex differences in adult mortality, egg maturation rate, and juvenile survival affect the pattern of care that will be most likely to evolve. Maternal care is more likely if female adult mortality is high, whereas paternal care is more likely if male adult mortality is high. These findings suggest that basic life-history differences between the sexes can alone explain the origin of maternal, paternal, and bi-parental care. As a result, the influence of life-history characteristics should be considered as a baseline scenario in studies examining the origin of care."

A basic prediction of this hypothesis is that egg pigmentation reflects female quality. In this study we examine whether there is a relationship between eggshell colouration and either female quality or egg quality in reed warblers. This open cup nesting species has eggs that are heavily spotted with brownish marks on a bluish-green background. We used several parameters describing female and egg quality, and measured eggshell colouration at the blunt pole and the egg centre, deriving four colour variables from colour spectrometry. To determine egg quality parameters, the third egg of each clutch was sampled and analysed. To determine female quality, females were trapped shortly after egg laying, and several morphological and a single conditional variable were determined. Additionally, a blood sample was taken to determine blood parasites (avian malaria and Trypanosoma spp.) and a faecal sample to determine intestinal parasites (Isospora spp). Our results revealed that eggshell pigmentation appears to be independent of female condition and parasites, but reflects concentrations of egg compounds such as testosterone and lysozyme. Egg colouration is also related to yolk weight and egg size. Our results further suggested that the information about colour varies depending on the position on the egg (blunt pole or egg centre). The only relationship with females was between female size (tarsus length) and egg colouration, which suggests a genetic component. We discuss reasons for the absence of a relationship between egg colouration and female quality."

Whether a similar effect is present in precocial species that do not beg is less well known. We therefore increased yolk testosterone levels within the physiological range at the onset of incubation to study its effects on food competition behaviour in the domestic chicken, Gallus gallus domesticus. We found an increase in competitiveness in testosterone-treated male domestic chicks, raising their level to that of the females. This is in line with the decrease in circulating plasma levels of males in the direction of the levels in females, and the overall decrease in androgen receptor densities after prenatal treatment as found previously. Hormones are known to have long-lasting organizing effects on behaviour and to affect sexual differentiation in vertebrates. Although research into hormone-mediated maternal effects has been productive, only a few studies describe (the ambiguous) effects into adulthood. Therefore we followed our animals into adulthood and recorded androgen-dependent social behaviour and secondary sexual characteristics, body mass and circulating plasma testosterone levels and checked whether these variables were treatment dependent. Treatment had a near significant effect on comb colour (both brightness and chroma). Again treatment caused a shift towards a more female-like phenotype. This suggests that, in contrast to earlier suggestions, maternal androgens may interact with (but not disrupt) sexual differentiation of brain and behaviour and the development of secondary sexual characteristics.

However, it remains unclear how common this effect might be. Also currently unknown is whether females change egg composition when assisted by helpers. This effect is predicted by current maternal allocation theory, but has not been previously investigated. We studied egg mass and contents in sociable weavers (Philetairus socius). We found that egg mass decreased with group size, while fledgling mass did not vary, suggesting that helpers may compensate for the reduced investment in eggs. We found no differences in eggs' carotenoid contents, but females assisted by helpers produced eggs with lower hormonal content, specifically testosterone, androstenedione (A4) and corticosterone levels. Taken together, these results suggest that the environment created by helpers can influence maternal allocation and potentially offspring phenotypes."

The relative length of digit 2 to digit 4 (2D:4D) in adults is thought to reflect the relative concentration of androgens and estrogens during development and has been used as a morphological proxy of developmental hormone exposure, enabling the exploration of the relationships between individual differences in hormone exposure and phenotype. Here, we use this approach and ask whether 2D:4D relates to the responsiveness of the adult hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and to sexually dimorphic structures (wing, tail, and tarsus length) in a common songbird, the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis). Among males, we found a negative relationship between 2D:4D and the ability to elevate testosterone in response to a physiological challenge, an injection of gonadotropin-releasing hormone. We also found age- and sex-specific relationships between 2D:4D and wing, tail, and tarsus length. We found a positive relationship between 2D:4D and body size measures in females, and second-year and older males, but a negative relationship in first-year males. We conclude that individual variation in exposure to developmental hormones, as reflected by 2D:4D, is correlated with adult hormone production ability and sexually dimorphic morphology in adulthood, suggesting that endogenous variation in steroid hormone exposure may have long-term consequences similar to those seen in experimental manipulations."

Artificial manipulation of male attractiveness has been found to affect female sexual preferences and maternal investment. In this regard, supranormal stimuli are thought to increase such responses. The present study was designed to assess whether supranormal acoustic stimuli, known to induce high levels of sexual responsiveness in female canaries, Serinus canaria, could increase maternal investment beyond levels observed in birds exposed to natural songs. Exposure to supranormal songs (G phrases) increased maternal investment: compared to females exposed to moderately attractive (Control) or naturally attractive (A) phrases. Females exposed to supranormal songs laid bigger eggs (egg volume and mass, albumen mass); moreover, females in the G group laid eggs with heavier yolks than females in the Control group. In contrast, no differences were found between groups with regard to testosterone deposition in the eggs. Thus, the adjustment of females' investment in their brood seems to take various forms that appear to be related to different features of males' sexually selected traits, which raises the questions of how and why these different mechanisms have been selected.

We investigated the cross-generation impact of a moderate heat challenge in chickens. We hypothesized that a warm temperature-within the thermotolerance range-would affect the hormonal environment provided to embryos by mothers, and in turn, affect the morphology and behavioral phenotype of offspring. Methodology/Principal Findings: Laying hens were raised under a standard thermal condition at 21 degrees C (controls) or 30 degrees C (experimental) for 5 consecutive weeks. A significant increase was observed in the internal temperature of hens exposed to the warm treatment; however plasma corticosterone levels remained unaffected. The laying rate was not affected, but experimental hens laid lighter eggs than the controls during the treatment. As expected, the maternal thermal environment affected yolk hormone contents. Eggs laid by the experimental hens showed significantly higher concentrations of yolk progesterone, testosterone, and estradiol. All chicks were raised under standard thermal conditions. The quality of hatchlings, growth, feeding behavior and emotional reactivity of chicks were analyzed. Offspring of experimental hens (C30 chicks) were lighter but obtained better morphological quality scores at hatching than the controls (C21 chicks). C30 chicks expressed lesser distress calls when exposed to a novel food. Unlike C21 chicks, C30 chicks expressed no preference for energetic food. Conclusion/Significance: Our findings suggest that moderate heat challenge triggers maternal effects and modulate the developmental trajectory of offspring in a way that may be adaptive. This suggests that the impact of heat challenges on captive or wild populations might have a cross-generation effect."

This range of social environments is associated with variation in a number of phenotypic and life-history traits. We investigate whether maternal effects are adjusted accordingly. We found no evidence for the prediction that females might benefit from modifying brood hierarchies through an increased deposition of androgens with laying order. Instead, females appear to exacerbate brood reduction by decreasing the costly production of yolk mass and antioxidants with laying order. Additionally, we found that this effect did not depend on colony size. Finally, in accordance with an expected increased intensity of environmental stress with increasing colony size, we found that yolk androgen concentration increased with colony size. This result suggests that females may enhance the competitive ability of offspring raised in larger colonies, possibly preparing the offspring for a competitive social environment."

These maternal testosterone concentrations vary systematically within clutches in different patterns and may enable mothers to adaptively fine-tune competitive hierarchies within broods. We performed a comparative analysis to investigate this hypothesis using a broad set of avian species. We expected species with small size differences among siblings (arising from small hatching asynchrony or slow growth rates) to aim for survival of the whole brood in good years and therefore compensate last-hatching eggs with relatively more testosterone. We expected species with large size differences among siblings (large hatching asynchrony or fast growth rates) to produce surplus young as insurance against failed offspring and to facilitate elimination of redundant surplus young by bestowing last-hatching eggs with relatively less testosterone. As predicted, we found that maternal testosterone compensation to last-hatching eggs is stronger when size differences among siblings become smaller. Maternal testosterone compensation to last-hatching eggs also correlated negatively with hatching asynchrony and growth rates.

Here I explore the range of explanations for within-brood diversity from the perspective of nonhuman families, particularly birds that share certain key features with human families. I examine the role of social rank in creating a nonshared environment within the family, and present data from a model system (an altricial bird) to illustrate how different the effective environments experienced by offspring sitting side-by-side in the same confined physical space, tended by the same parents, and experiencing similar ecological variability, can be. These broodmates can effectively live in different worlds. I then briefly explore other sources of diversity among offspring in nonhuman families, including within brood genetic differences and non-genetic maternal (parental) effects that often covary with birth / hatching rank. Given the ubiquity and far-reaching consequences of maternal effects in nonhuman families, and some human data suggestive of similar patterns, it would seem worthwhile to explore the potential role of maternal effects in creating phenotypic diversity in psychological traits among children in human families."

To answer these questions, we enhanced yolk testosterone by injecting testosterone (T) in oil into Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) eggs prior to incubation. Vehicle-injected (V) eggs served as controls. From age 3 weeks to 8 weeks, sexual development was measured using morphological and physiological traits, and social behavior was measured, including male-typical sexual behavior.

These long-lasting and sex-specific yolk testosterone effects on the development of dimorphic traits, but without disrupting sexual differentiation of reproductive behavior suggest potential organizational effects of maternal testosterone, but acting through separate processes than the endocrine mechanisms previously shown to control sexual differentiation.

We predicted that if yolk precursors are constrained, androgen transport to developing yolks would be similarly constrained. We reveal positive linear relationships between maternal VTG and androgens in small A-eggs but not larger B-eggs, which is consistent with a migratory constraint operating on the A-egg. Results suggest that intra-clutch variation in total yolk androgen levels depends on the production and uptake of yolk precursors.

In both control and experimentally reversed broods, first hatched chicks had a higher survival than last hatched siblings. Yet, nestlings that hatched from eggs laid in the second half of a clutch begged with a greater intensity than nestlings hatched from eggs laid in the first half of a clutch.

The lack of a substantial difference in the size and condition of surviving nestlings in respect to laying order suggests that differential resource allocation across the egg-laying sequence partially compensates for hatching last in asynchronous broods and reduces the negative effects of the nestling size hierarchy.

Longevity is a major determinant of individual differences in Darwinian fitness. Several studies have analyzed the stochastic, time-dependent causes of variation in longevity, but little information exists from free-ranging animal populations on the effects that environmental conditions and phenotype early in ontogeny have on duration of life. 2. In this long-term (19932011) study of a migratory, colonial, passerine bird, the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica), we analyzed longevity and, in a subsample of individuals, lifetime reproductive success (LRS) of the offspring that reached sexual maturity in relation to hatching date, which can affect the rearing environment through a seasonal deterioration in ecological conditions. Moreover, we analyzed the consequences of variation in body size and, for the first time in any species, of a major component of immunity on longevity, both by looking at absolute phenotypic values and at deviations from the brood mean. 3. Accelerated failure time models showed that individuals of both sexes that hatched early in any breeding season enjoyed larger longevity and larger LRS, indicating directional selection for early breeding. Both male and female offspring with large T cell-mediated immune response relative to their siblings and female nestlings that dominated the brood size/age hierarchy had larger longevity than their siblings of inferior phenotypic quality/age. Conversely, absolute phenotypic values did not predict longevity. 4. Frailty modelling disclosed marked spatial heterogeneity in longevity among colonies of origin, again stressing the impact of rearing conditions on longevity. 5. This study therefore reinforces the notion that perinatal environment and maternal decisions over timing and site of breeding, and position in the brood hierarchy can have marked effects on progeny life history that extend well into adulthood. In addition, it provides the first evidence from any bird population in the wild that immune response when nestlings predicts individuals longevity after sexual maturation."

Using an experimental approach, we studied the long-term effects of yolk androgens on several phenotypic traits and parental behavior in adult and female collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis). We elevated yolk androgen levels and monitored the experimental recruits the following breeding seasons. Androgen treatment had a sex-dependent effect on adult body condition, yolk androgen-treated males being heavier than control males when controlling for size, a result which may be caused potentially by selective mortality, physiological differences, or different life-history strategies. Androgen treatment did not however affect the expression of sexually selected plumage ornaments (forehead and wing patch size), UV coloration, or parental feeding rate in either sex. Our results suggest that yolk androgens are unlikely to affect sexual selection via plumage characteristics or contribute to breeding success via altered parental care. Yolk androgens do not seem to act as a means for female collared flycatchers to enhance the attractiveness of their sons. The lower return rate previously observed for androgen-treated male offspring compared to controls may therefore not be due to lower mating or breeding success, but may rather reflect lower survival or higher dispersal propensity of yolk androgen-treated males."

All of these pathways may, therefore, form significant sources of variation in maternal effects. Here, we focused on the maternal transfer of carotenoids and vitamin E to the egg yolk, using canaries as a model species. Maternal yolk carotenoids and vitamin E are known to generate significant phenotypic variation in offspring, representing examples of maternal effects. We studied the intra-individual consistency in deposition patterns across two years and the mother-daughter resemblance across two generations in order to estimate the level of heritable variation. The effects of the current environmental conditions were studied via a food supplementation experiment, while the consequences of past environmental conditions were estimated on the basis of the early growth trajectories. Results: There was a significant effect of the current environmental conditions on the yolk carotenoid and vitamin E deposition, but this effect varied between antioxidant components. The deposition of yolk carotenoids and vitamin E were linked to the process of yolk formation. Past environmental conditions did not contribute to the variation in yolk carotenoid and vitamin E levels nor did we find significant heritable variation. Conclusions: The transfer of carotenoids or vitamin E may be an example where current environmental variation is largely passed from the mother to the offspring, despite the numerous intermediate physiological steps that are involved. Differences in the effect of the environmental conditions as experienced by the mother during laying may be due to differences in availability as well as physiological processes such as competitive exclusion or selective absorption."

Early growth conditions, for example hormonal environment during embryonic development, may have long-lasting effects on behaviour and phenotype, with subsequent fitness consequences. Yolk androgens have been shown to affect various offspring traits in the short-term, but fitness consequences for either offspring or parents, a prerequisite for studying the adaptiveness of this maternal effect, are poorly known in the wild. 2. We experimentally elevated yolk androgen levels of whole clutches in a wild population of collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) and investigated the long-term effects of yolk androgens on offspring local recruitment, parental return rate, and timing and success of breeding in both parents and offspring in the breeding season(s) following the manipulation. 3. Yolk androgen elevation lowered the local recruitment rate of male, but not female offspring, but had no effect on any breeding parameters of offspring of either sex. Furthermore, yolk androgen elevation of the clutch had no effect on the return rate or any breeding parameters of the parents. 4. Our results indicate that high yolk androgen levels may impose a potential direct fitness cost for male offspring, but no long-lasting additional indirect fitness costs for parents (direct costs of transferring androgens to eggs not considered). Such a sex-specific cost on offspring could constrain yolk androgen deposition and select for sex-specific deposition mechanisms. 5. As yolk androgen levels in this population are heritable, our results on long-term fitness effect of yolk androgens support the idea that hormone-mediated maternal effects may evolve under selection and thereby affect evolutionary processes."

When predictable seasonal changes affect offspring fitness, we expect offspring to evolve phenotypes that minimize the costs of seasonal variation in timing of breeding. For species with parental care during embryonic development, offspring receive seasonal cues of the environment from parents that are biased by their parent's fitness (which is not equivalent to offspring fitness). Therefore, mechanisms enabling offspring to detect environmental cues independent of parents should be strongly favoured. 2. We experimentally evaluated the ability of avian embryos to integrate cues of season from photoperiod and maternal environments present in eggs to produce seasonal variation in phenotypes among Franklin's gull (Leucophaeus pipixcan) hatchlings. Eggs were collected early and late in the season and some were separated into their component parts and others were incubated under short (early season) and long (late season) photoperiods. After hatching, we measured the structural size of the chicks and the amount of yolk sac reserves. 3. We found that hatchling size, a phenotype linked with fitness, is sensitive to both egg contents provided by mothers and photoperiod, and development time decreases across the season. The effects of integrating cues of season from eggs and photoperiod on offspring phenotype are complex, and when cues of season from eggs are mismatched with cues of season from photoperiod, alternate phenotypes are created. 4. We also found that seasonal variation in egg size, yolk, albumen or shell content of the eggs do not account for the seasonal maternal egg effect on hatchling size. This seasonal maternal effect could be a result of other egg constituents or reflect heritable variation in timing of breeding that is linked with offspring size. 5. Changes in breeding phenology of adults could result in a mismatch between cues from parents and photoperiod cues of season. For example, if breeding seasons advanced such that late season birds initiate breeding at an early season photoperiod, offspring would then be integrating maternal cues of late season with photoperiod cues of early season and alter their phenotypes. We expect our results to initiate new studies on how vertebrate embryos integrate environmental cues with maternal effects and offspring responses to optimize the expression of offspring phenotype."

We measured yolk testosterone in two populations of Redpolls (Carduelis flammea/hornemanni) nesting around Toolik Lake Field Station and in Barrow, Alaska to test three predictions about the patterns of yolk testosterone concentrations. First, we predicted yolk testosterone to increase with laying sequence so as to minimize the deleterious effects of hatching asynchrony on chicks from later hatched eggs in a species without delayed incubation. Second, we predicted yolk testosterone to be higher in Barrow where food is more abundant and Redpoll body condition is higher. Third, we predicted yolk testosterone to correlate positively with egg mass and yolk mass, which are two other indicators of maternal investment. An initial analysis that did not consider egg and yolk mass lent support to the first of these predictions. However, more thorough statistical analysis revealed that relationships between yolk testosterone and laying sequence and between yolk testosterone and site were not direct but rather driven by associations among yolk testosterone, egg mass, and yolk mass. While yolk testosterone concentration itself did not differ between sites, the relationship between yolk testosterone and egg and yolk mass did. Yolk testosterone correlated positively with egg mass at Barrow and showed a significant quadratic association with yolk mass in Toolik. While laying sequence and yolk testosterone appeared to be correlated when egg and yolk mass were not considered, the full statistical model suggests that egg and yolk mass are directly associated with laying sequence while yolk testosterone concentrations are not. These results suggest complicated relationships among egg mass, yolk mass, yolk testosterone, site, and laying sequence that should be taken into account in future studies. They also suggest that deposition of yolk testosterone may be a regulated rather than being a purely passive process."

This has been explored only in few bird species with carotenoid-based traits. We tested this hypothesis in the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa), a gallinacean with very variable laying capacity. Both sexes display carotenoid-based ornamentation that gradually fades throughout the laying period. Here, the redness of beak and eye rings of captive males was intensified after mating by means of paint. The proportion of females that laid eggs did not differ between treatments. Amongst laying females, those mated with colour-enhanced males (experimental females) tended to lay earlier and produced significantly more eggs than controls, but of similar quality (egg mass and composition). We additionally investigated whether male attractiveness influenced egg components depending on the clutch size and laying sequence. The testosterone level in eggs from experimental females was positively related to the laying order, whereas control eggs did not show any trend.

Of the major avian steroid hormones found in yolk, progesterone is by far the most abundant at oviposition, but has received little research attention to date. In this study, we examine the metabolism of {[}H-3]-progesterone injected into freshly laid European starling eggs throughout the first 5 days of development by characterization of radioactivity within the egg homogenate. We also introduce a technique that utilizes a focal, freeze/thaw cycle to prevent embryonic development and allows us to assess the role of the embryo in metabolizing progesterone during early incubation. Two major findings result. First is that {[}H-3]-progesterone is metabolized in eggs possessing a developing embryo, but not in eggs with disrupted embryonic development. Second is that the change in the distribution of radioactivity within eggs possessing an embryo is the result of metabolism of {[}H-3]-progesterone to a more polar form that is subsequently conjugated. Together, these data suggest live embryos are necessary for metabolism of progesterone during early incubation, underscoring the potentially important contribution of embryos to functional modulation or mediation of maternal yolk steroid effects.

Here we examined the possible role of maternal steroids deposited in eggs as an underlying mechanism. We collected eggs from female great tits under either experimentally increased predation risk (PRED) or control treatments (CON) and analyzed the concentration of testosterone, androstenedione, and progesterone in the yolks. PRED eggs contained lower levels of testosterone than CON eggs, but levels of androstenedione and progesterone did not differ. The smaller size and mass of chicks found in the previous study may thus be explained by the lower testosterone concentrations, since yolk testosterone is known to boost growth and development. Alternatively, testosterone may act as a modulator of differential investment into morphological traits, rather than a simple growth enhancer, explaining lower body mass in conjunction with the accelerated wing growth. This could possibly occur concurrently with other hormones such as corticosterone. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Moreover, mothers that are of better quality and/or experience better feeding conditions during laying are expected to increase their deposition of resources to the egg, resulting in differences between clutches {[}investment hypothesis (PFH)].

However, the costs and benefits of this compensatory strategy probably depend on environmental factors determining the survival chances of the chicks such as the food conditions, which should, therefore, influence maternal yolk androgen deposition. We studied the consequences of manipulated food conditions on the expected level of hatching asynchrony in canaries (Serinus canaria) assigning females to either a low (=LQ) or high quality (=HQ) diet. We measured the incubation behaviour (as incubation attendance) and the yolk androgen deposition in order to investigate whether and how females modulate hatching asynchrony in relation to the food conditions. Females on a HQ diet laid larger and heavier clutches, showed a stronger increase in yolk testosterone content towards the last-laid eggs, but did not alter their incubation attendance. Thus, females on a HQ diet seem to favour the survival of later hatching chicks, as indicated by their yolk testosterone deposition pattern. However, females on a HQ diet laid larger clutches and might need to compensate more in order to achieve a similar degree of hatching asynchrony than females on a LQ diet, given the lack of plasticity in incubation attendance. This suggests that canary females respond to food manipulations mainly via changes in clutch size rather than by altering the degree of hatching asynchrony. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we report that injections of a physiological dose of testosterone (T) into yolks of freshly laid eggs of a small, seasonally breeding songbird, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus), increased survivorship in a semi-natural aviary environment. In addition, survival effects of developmental T exposure were sex-dependent, with males generally having a higher risk of death. Separate analyses for young birds in their first year of life (from hatching up to the first reproductive period the following calendar year) and in adulthood (after the first breeding season) showed similar effects. For first-year birds, mortality risk was higher during the winter than during the period after fledging; for adults, mortality risk was higher during the reproductive than the non-reproductive phase (post-breeding molt and winter). T treatment did not affect nestling body mass, but resulted in higher body mass at 3-4 months of age; T and body mass at this age interacted to influence mortality risk.

In birds, maternal yolk hormones represent such a pathway for maternal effects, and their adaptive significance depends thus on the plasticity in maternal yolk hormone deposition. We studied sources of variation in yolk testosterone deposition, focusing on the often neglected contribution of the (partly heritable) maternal phenotype. We investigated consistency and heritability of yolk testosterone deposition in captive canaries of which the F(1) generation was raised in foster nests and analyzed the potential effects of the early developmental conditions. We found significant female consistency across years in egg mass, yolk mass and total amount of yolk testosterone but not in yolk testosterone concentrations. Females varied the yolk testosterone concentrations of their eggs across years mainly via changes in yolk mass. The heritable variation in egg mass, yolk mass and amount of yolk testosterone but not yolk testosterone concentrations was within the range of previous studies, but not significantly different from zero. Finally, the growth of the daughters as nestling had a significant effect on their yolk testosterone deposition at adulthood indicating the transgenerational potential for environmental effects - via the effects of yolk hormones on offspring development.

However, both pathways have so far only been studied in isolation, even though maternal effects are known to have significant effects on early development. Thus, maternal yolk hormones - an important mediator of maternal effects - may affect neophobia both through direct effects on neophobic behaviour and/or by affecting the early development. Both pathways may even act in concert. We measured the neophobic response and habituation to novel food, as well as the response to a novel object in 8-months-old canaries (Serious canaria). All birds hatched from eggs with elevated yolk testosterone levels or control-treated eggs, and grew up in distinct experimentally-manipulated positions within the sibling hierarchy, which allowed us to test whether and how the effects of prenatally elevated yolk testosterone levels on neophobic behaviour vary with the environmental conditions experienced post-hatch. Neither the experimentally-manipulated yolk testosterone levels nor the position within the sibling hierarchy had a direct effect on neophobic behaviour. The elevation of the yolk testosterone levels modulated the neophobic behaviour and the habituation to novel situations of juvenile canaries only in interplay with the experimentally manipulated position in the sibling hierarchy and offspring sex. The strongest increase of neophobic behaviour was observed in individuals that hatched from eggs with elevated yolk testosterone content while growing up in a superior position in the sibling hierarchy - and in males. However, these effects varied with the focal explanatory variable. Based on our results and a review of the literature, we conclude that neither prenatal maternal nor early environmental effects post-hatching form the main source of variation of neophobia in itself, but that the effects observed as well as the inconsistency thereof can best be explained by the interaction of different partly unknown pathways."

Maternally deposited hormones affect the embryo and chick's physiology and behaviour. It has been observed that progesterone, a hormone present at higher levels than other steroid hormones in egg yolks, is negatively related to body mass in embryos, chicks and adults. A differential within-clutch progesterone deposition could therefore be linked to the size hierarchy between siblings and to the resulting brood reduction. We tested whether yolk progesterone levels differed between eggs according to future parental ability to feed the entire clutch in wild rockhopper penguins Eudyptes chrysocome. This species presents a unique reversed egg-size dimorphism and hatching asynchrony, with the larger second-laid egg (B-egg) hatching before the smaller first-laid egg (A-egg). Yolk progesterone levels increased only slightly with female body mass at laying. However, intra-clutch ratios were not related to female body mass. On the other hand, yolk progesterone levels increased significantly with the date of laying onset for A-eggs while they decreased for B-eggs. Early clutches therefore had proportionally more progesterone in the B-egg compared to the A-egg while late clutches had proportionally less progesterone in the B-egg. We propose that females could strategically regulate yolk progesterone deposition within clutches according to the expected food availability during chick growth, an adaptive strategy to adjust brood reduction to conditions. We also discuss these results, relating to yolk progesterone, in the broader context of other yolk steroids."

Reassuringly we find that the patterns that have been found in the majority of studies of domesticated populations with respect to investment across the laying sequence were all present in the wild population. The size and mass of eggs increased through the laying sequence whilst the concentration of carotenoids significantly decreased across the laying sequence. Although there was no significant pattern with respect to testosterone across the laying sequence the first two eggs had a higher level of testosterone than the last few eggs in the clutch, which is also consistent with the findings of earlier studies in captive populations."

We experimentally increased yolk testosterone concentrations in canary eggs and simultaneously manipulated the post-hatching context via an experimental tick-infestation of the chicks. This allows us to evaluate the context-dependency of hormone-mediated maternal effects, as it has previously been shown that ectoparasites alter the maternal yolk androgen deposition. The experimental tick infestation reduced growth in chicks from sham-treated eggs, indicating harmful effects of this ectoparasite in canaries. Chicks from testosterone-treated eggs were not affected in their development by ticks, suggesting lower ectoparasite vulnerability. But this may also be due to the fact that experimentally elevated yolk testosterone levels impaired growth even under parasite-free conditions. This contrasts previous studies, but these studies often manipulated first laid eggs, while we used eggs of subsequent laying positions. Later laid eggs are presumably of lower quality and contain higher yolk testosterone concentrations. Thus, the effects of elevated yolk testosterone on growth may be dose-dependent or vary with the egg quality, suggesting prenatal context-dependency. J. Exp. Zool. 315:553-561, 2011.

In avian species, context-dependency of maternal effects may result in variation in egg composition, as well as in differential patterns of covariation among selected egg components, according to, for example, position in the laying sequence or offspring sex. We investigated variation in major classes of egg yolk components (carotenoids, vitamins and steroid hormones) in relation to egg size, position in the laying sequence and embryo sex in clutches of the Yellow-legged Gull (Larus michahellis). We also investigated their covariation, to highlight mutual adjustments, maternal constraints or trade-offs in egg allocation. Results: Laying sequence-specific patterns of allocation emerged: concentration of carotenoids and vitamin E decreased, while concentrations of androgens increased. Vitamin A, estradiol and corticosterone did not show any change. There was no evidence of sex-specific allocation or covariation of yolk components. Concentrations of carotenoids and vitamins were positively correlated. Egg mass decreased along the laying sequence, and this decrease was negatively correlated with the mean concentrations of carotenoids in clutches, suggesting that nutritionally constrained females lay low quality clutches in terms of carotenoid content. Finally, clutches with smaller decline in antioxidants between first-and last-laid eggs had a larger increase in yolk corticosterone, suggesting that a smaller antioxidant depletion along the laying sequence may entail a cost for laying females in terms of increased stress levels. Conclusions: Since some of the analyzed yolk components (e. g. testosterone and lutein) are known to exert sex-specific phenotypic effects on the progeny in this species, the lack of sex-specific egg allocation by mothers may either result from trade-offs between contrasting effects of different egg components on male and female offspring, or indicate that sex-specific traits are controlled primarily by mechanisms of sexual differentiation, including endogenous hormone production or metabolism of exogenous antioxidants, during embryonic development."

Although the fact that environment controllability decreases emotional responses in animals is well established, far less is known about its potential trans-generational effects. As the levels of avian yolk hormones can vary according to the mother's environment, we hypothesized that housing environment of mothers would modulate the quality of her eggs and in turn her offspring's behaviour. Two groups of female japanese quail were constituted: a group that had access to a place to hide in their home-cage (Hd, n = 20) and a group that had nowhere to hide (NoHd, n = 20) when stressed. Both groups were submitted to daily human disturbances for a twenty-day-period. Hd females produced eggs with both less testosterone and androstenedione than did NoHd females. The emotional and social reactivity of Hd female's offspring were lower and their growth wes slower than those of NoHd females' offspring. Our results show that a minor difference in housing environment had substantial effects on eggs and offspring. The presence of a shelter probably helped quail to cope with daily human disturbances, producing less reactive offspring. This transgenerational effect caused by an opportunity to hide could lead to applications in care of laboratory animals, conservation biology and animal welfare."

In this study, we injected testosterone (T) in egg albumen of captive ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) eggs. We then assessed the consequences for chick growth, cell-mediated immunity, and multiple male secondary sexual traits at maturity by comparison with a control group. We also compared the covariation between traits in the two experimental groups. We found that control males had redder wattles than males from T-injected eggs, suggesting that attractiveness and reproductive success of the offspring might vary depending on maternal transfer of T to the eggs. T treatment also modified the covariation between cell-mediated immunity and wattle coloration and between the area of the wattle and the expression of another secondary sexual trait, the ear tufts. These effects are likely to translate into fitness differences among the offspring if mate acquisition depends on the simultaneous expression of several traits that are differentially affected by the same maternal contribution. Maternal effects mediated by egg hormones might affect the fitness of the offspring not only by directional modification of phenotypic traits, but also by facilitating or inhibiting their covariation. This suggests the possibility that female choice based on the relative expression of multiple secondary sexual traits exerts a pressure on how maternal transfer of androgens contributes to developmental programs."

The extent to which the disadvantage of frail individuals at independence is expressed predominantly in terms of higher mortality and disappearance from the population before recruitment, or persists after recruitment, is still an open question. Due to the rarity of relevant data and the fact that most studies are retrospective, heterogeneity in methods and timescales hampers the identification of general patterns. Nevertheless, several studies have provided evidence of a relationship between early conditions and future reproductive parameters, or lifetime reproductive success. Evidence from large mammals suggests substantial long-term individual and population effects of early conditions, including trans-generational maternal effects. Evidence from short-lived birds also suggests long-term individual consequences, and maternal effects have been documented in long-lived ones. Despite logistical and financial difficulties inherent in long-term studies, they are the only way of addressing Lindstrom's second statement. Existing long-term longitudinal datasets should be re-analyzed using recently developed capture-mark-recapture models handling state uncertainty and unobservable heterogeneity in populations.

Across vertebrates, glucocorticoids can suppress reproduction by downregulating gonadal hormones. Using the chicken as a model species, we therefore tested whether elevated levels of plasma corticosterone in female birds influence the production of gonadal steroids by the ovarian follicles and thus the amount of reproductive hormones in the egg yolk. Adult laying hens of two different strains (ISA brown and white Leghorn) were implanted subcutaneously with corticosterone pellets that elevated plasma corticosterone concentrations over a period of nine days. Steroid hormones were subsequently quantified in plasma and yolk. Corticosterone-implanted hens of both strains had lower plasma progesterone and testosterone levels and their yolks contained less progesterone and testosterone. The treatment also reduced egg and yolk mass. Plasma estrogen concentrations decreased in white Leghorns only whereas in both strains yolk estrogens were unaffected. Our results demonstrate for the first time that maternal plasma corticosterone levels influence reproductive hormone concentrations in the yolk. Maternal corticosterone could therefore mediate environmentally induced changes in yolk gonadal hormone concentrations.

Less is known about how embryos of oviparous amniotes regulate their endocrine environment because most studies have focused on relating initial steroid levels in the yolk at oviposition to offspring phenotype. We tested the hypothesis that embryos of oviparous amniotes regulate their endocrine environment by conjugating maternal steroids and subsequently using the metabolites as precursors for steroid production later in development. Using the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta), we first characterized the conjugation of exogenous oestradiol to either oestradiol glucuronide or oestradiol sulphate (E-2-S) in ovo during the first 15 days of development. Results show that oestradiol is primarily conjugated to E-2-S. We then examined whether E-2-S influenced sex determination and report that E-2-S increases the production of female offspring.

In birds, variation in yolk androgen allocation over the laying sequence is thought to modulate dominance of senior chicks over junior brood mates. We tested this hypothesis in zebra finches, which show a naturally decreasing pattern of within-clutch testosterone allocation. We abolished these within-clutch differences by experimentally elevating yolk testosterone levels in eggs 2-6 to the level of egg 1, and we assessed fitness measures for junior offspring (eggs 2-6), senior offspring (egg 1), and their mothers. Testosterone-injected eggs hatched later than control eggs.

In this study, we investigated the effects of daily unpredictable stressors applied to laying Japanese quail on their offspring's morphological and behavioural development. We also investigated the effects of our procedure on female reproductive output and on egg characteristics (weight, composition, yolk sex steroid levels). Our procedure induced only a mild stress: laying and egg fertilization rates of stressed females were not impaired; they remained similar to those of control females. Nonetheless, our stress procedure had an impact on some egg characteristics: stressed females' eggs were heavier, contained more albumen and tended to have higher yolk testosterone levels than control females' eggs. Stressed females' offspring hatched earlier, were heavier at hatching and had a different growth pattern than did control females' offspring. They also appeared to have a higher emotional reactivity than control chicks when encountering a novel environment and they reacted more strongly following social separation. Our study revealed that mild stressors applied to laying Japanese quail can increase the emotional reactivity of their chicks and suggested that maternal stress effects on offspring are mediated by changes in egg composition and yolk testosterone levels.

In a previous study, in ovo exposure to increased levels of testosterone induced metabolic costs early in life. It is, however, unknown whether in ovo androgens also have long-term effects on individual metabolic rates. In this study, we show that experimentally increased levels of in ovo testosterone in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) result in a 7\% higher resting metabolic rate when they are adults. This shows that maternally transferred hormones can induce long-term effects on metabolic demands and potentially influence variation in life-history strategies among offspring.

However, evidence for digit ratios reflecting early steroid levels is weak, as experimental studies, especially in wild populations, are scarce. We studied the association between maternally derived yolk androgens and digit ratios (2D:4D, 2D:3D and 3D:4D) using both correlative data and a rather high level of experimental elevation of yolk androgens in a passerine bird, the pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca). We also examined whether digit ratios have indicator value in an evolutionary context by studying correlations between digit ratios and reproductive traits, secondary sexual traits and exploratory behaviour. We did not find any association between digit ratios and yolk androgen level either in correlative or experimental data. Digit ratios were neither related to any of the reproductive and secondary sexual traits or exploratory behaviour measured. There was, however, a sex difference in 2D:3D and 3D:4D of adult birds (due to second and fourth digits being shorter in females), which was not apparent in fledglings or captivity-raised juveniles. This suggests that either the sex difference may develop as late as during the sexual maturation for breeding. These results indicate that, in this species, digit ratios are not reliable markers of maternally derived yolk androgen exposure and that they bear little relevance as correlates of the adaptive traits we measured."

There is also good evidence that hormones influence offspring fitness, but the direction of reported effects is inconsistent: eight studies report a positive effect on offspring fitness and 10 a negative effect. We explore potential pathways linking hormonal effects on begging and growth. We find that our current understanding of these pathways is incomplete, and suggest a simple model linking hormonal effects on begging and growth. We next discuss the role of hormones as mediators of parent-offspring conflict. We find little evidence that maternal hormones provide a mechanism for parental favouritism. We use graphical models to explore the hypothesis that maternal hormones act as honest signals, and find that costs of hormone production can ensure the honesty of maternal hormones but only under very restricted conditions. We discuss evidence from recent cross-fostering experiments suggesting that maternal hormones act in the context of overlapping interests between parents and offspring.

Interestingly, testosterone can also upregulate the bioavailability of certain antioxidants but simultaneously increases the susceptibility to oxidative stress in adulthood. However, little is known about the effects of maternally derived yolk testosterone on oxidative stress in developing birds. Here, we investigated the role of yolk testosterone on oxidative stress of yellow-legged gull chicks during their early development by experimentally increasing yolk testosterone levels. Levels of antioxidants, reactive oxygen species and lipid oxidative damage were determined in plasma during nestlings' growth. Our results revealed that, contrary to control chicks, birds hatched from testosterone-treated eggs did not show an increase in the levels of oxidative damage during postnatal development. Moreover, the same birds showed a transient increase in plasma antioxidant levels.

There is much more variation in yolk androgen levels between females than within clutches, and in order to change the androgen levels of the eggs, we swapped whole clutches between nests. To estimate the androgen levels of the clutch, we measured the androgen content of a single egg per clutch. Females did not succeed in manipulating male effort using yolk androgens, since there was no relationship between the division of parental care within a pair and either original or foster egg androgen levels. One of these relationships should have occurred if females were manipulating males. The proportion of feeding visits by the male was higher when the male was old (55\%) than when he was young (45\%) and females laid eggs with higher androgen levels when mated with a young male. Young males did not exhibit any responses to yolk androgen levels either, which indicates that females cannot exploit their effort more than that of old males.

Embryonic day two broiler embryos developing on broiler yolk culture medium (YCM) had significantly higher heart rates than layer embryos developing on layer YCM (176 +/- 7 beats min(-1) and 147 +/- 7. beats min(-1), respectively). Broiler embryos developing on layer YCM exhibited heart rates typical of layer embryos developing normally on layer YCM. However, layer embryo heart rates were not affected by development on broiler YCM. Unlike O-2 consumption, development rate and body mass of embryos were significantly affected by exposure to different yolk types, with both broiler and layer embryos displaying traits that reflected yolk source rather than embryo genotype. Analysis of hormone concentrations of broiler and layer egg yolks revealed that testosterone concentrations were higher in broiler yolk (4.63 +/- 2.02 pg mg(-1) vs 3.32 +/- 1.92 pg mg(-1)), whereas triiodothyronine concentrations were higher in layer yolk (1.05 +/- 0.18 pg mg(-1) vs 0.46 +/- 0.22 pg mg(-1)).

Some studies support the idea that maternal hormones may signal and prepare offspring for prevailing conditions. Adaptive effects require flexible mechanisms of hormone deposition and response. Separate control over hormone levels in circulation and yolk allows independent effects on offspring and mothers, while regulation of the response to maternal hormones allows offspring to fine-tune the effects on different traits. There is good evidence for such flexibility in both deposition and response. Natural selection on hormone-mediated maternal effects may differ between mothers and offspring, because costs and benefits are not equally shared. Evolutionary changes in the deposition and effect of these hormones therefore depend upon the consequences for all family members.

The study was performed in Soto del Real, Madrid, in central Spain (40 degrees 44' N, 3 degrees 48' W) from March to July 2007. Before the onset of laying in the population females were trapped and marked when visiting nest-boxes. Captures were discontinued when laying approached and observations were performed to assess the identity of females breeding at each nest-box. Nests were monitored from egg laying to fledgling. In order to measure yolk androgens, the first egg laid was collected in all clutches before incubation started. Yolk concentrations of testosterone (T) and androstenedione (A4) were measured by EIA kits highly specific for each hormone. Nestling reproductive value was estimated in relation to nest ectoparasite load by the fly Carnus hemapterus. We found that females in early clutches laid larger eggs with higher androgen concentration than females in late clutches. Nestling reproductive value was also influenced by timing of reproduction: early clutches presented a lower ectoparasite load than late clutches. Finally, female investment in eggs was not related to nest ectoparasite load neither in early nor late clutches. With our results we conclude that spotless starling females invest more resources in early than in late clutches.

Eggs at the end of the laying sequence were smaller and had significantly smaller yolks than eggs early in the laying order. Fifth-laid eggs, as well as first-laid eggs, contained significantly lower concentrations of testosterone than eggs in other positions of the laying sequence.

Here, we consider how two types of yolk compounds, androgens and carotenoids, relate to the maternal social environment during the egg-laying period, controlling statistically for known correlations between various aspects of parental quality and egg yolk compounds. Barn swallows Hirundo rustica erythrogaster breed in groups of highly variable size and spacing, allowing us to test whether or not the social environment is correlated with these maternal effects. We found no relationship between carotenoid levels in eggs as a function of colony size, colony density, or nearest-neighbor distance. However, eggs from females in larger groups had lower concentrations and total amounts of yolk androgens than those from females in smaller, less dense social settings. Our results counter previous predictions and literature, showing that females breeding in large groups deposit more androgen in eggs, mechanistically, because they compete more with conspecifics and have higher circulating androgen levels themselves and, functionally, because it could be advantageous for their offspring to show high androgen-mediated competitive abilities early in life. Instead, because group size in this species is governed largely by site fidelity and the availability of old nests for re-use, and because reproductive output does not differ as a function of group size, it may be that competition is greater for limited nests in small groups, thus elevating androgen levels.

Previous studies have shown that White Leghorn hens show a heightened response to stress compared with Hy-Line Brown hens, producing significantly more corticosterone and displaying longer bouts of tonic immobility after handling, whereas baseline levels of corticosterone are similar between the strains. We tested the hypothesis that higher stress responsiveness would correspond to chronic accumulation and thus higher concentrations of corticosterone in egg yolks after exposure to stressors associated with routine maintenance. Eggs were collected from white and brown hens that were undisturbed except for daily feeding and routine egg collections. Corticosterone was quantified in plasma, egg yolks, and albumen and compared between strains. We predicted that corticosterone concentrations in yolk would be higher in eggs from white versus brown hens but that albumen corticosterone would not differ between strains due to the short term of albumen deposition. As predicted, yolk corticosterone concentrations were significantly higher in eggs produced by white hens, approximately twice those found in eggs laid by brown hens. Plasma and albumen concentrations of corticosterone were similar between groups. These results suggest that offspring hatching from eggs laid by White Leghorn hens are exposed to significantly more corticosterone through concentration in the egg yolk, which could permanently imprint offspring physiology and behavior."

However, so far context-dependent effects of maternal yolk hormones have not sufficiently been taken into account, which might contribute to the current level of inconsistency in yolk androgen-mediated effects. We experimentally elevated the yolk testosterone concentrations and manipulated the sibling size hierarchy. We focused on the effects of yolk testosterone on growth and monitored begging behavior and parental feeding preferences in search of the underlying mechanisms of changes in growth. Experimental changes in the yolk testosterone concentrations significantly affected offspring phenotype. However, elevated yolk testosterone concentrations only improved the growth of chicks that were at a competitive disadvantage, whereas it benefited all chicks when placed in staged competition for food as juvenile. This emphasizes the compensatory role of yolk androgens in the context of hatching asynchrony and its context dependency. Enhanced growth did not coincide with intensified begging. Neither males nor females preferentially fed chicks hatching from eggs with elevated yolk testosterone concentrations. Enhanced growth rather resulted from yolk testosterone induced changes in physiology, of which the detailed mechanisms are yet unknown."

However, in species where the amount of A(4) in the yolk much exceeds that of the other androgens, A(4) could represent the dominant agent of androgen-mediated maternal effects, in which case manipulations of T would be misdirected. We conducted our study in a species with high yolk A(4) and relatively low T and DHT levels, the Japanese quail Coturnix japonica. We injected unincubated eggs with a physiological dose of either A(4), T, or DHT, and measured hatchling growth, as well as behaviour in an open field test.

The A(4) and DHT treatments, in contrast, significantly increased reinstatement behaviour, but did not affect mass and size growth.

Our objective was to investigate the causal relation between these two maternal hormones, body condition, and offspring sex ratio in homing pigeons (Columba livia domestica). Following our earlier study, we again implanted females with testosterone and determined embryo sex of first eggs. To identify the pathway of sex ratio adjustment, we repeatedly measured not only maternal plasma testosterone and mass but also plasma corticosterone, cholesterol, and glucose, all indicators of body condition. We also calculated the temporal change in these parameters, which has been proposed to be a more accurate predictor of offspring sex ratio compared with the absolute values. Furthermore, we analyzed testosterone concentrations in outer yolk layers, which potentially influence the first meiotic division of the gamete. We found no relation between plasma parameter and embryo sex of first eggs; testosterone treatment did not affect any of the measured parameters. However, females that increased in mass produced more male embryos, irrespective of treatment group. Outer yolk layer testosterone concentrations did not differ between treatment groups or between male and female eggs.

They have been shown to influence a wide array of offspring traits, both early in life and in adulthood. One important offspring trait that is under the influence of maternal androgens is the immune system. In birds, a growing number of studies show that yolk androgens modulate immune function during the chick stage. However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding long-term effects of prenatal androgens on offspring immunity. In this study, we therefore investigated the influence of prenatal testosterone (T) on several measures of immunity in fledgling and adult zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Cell-mediated immune response (towards phytohaemagglutinin, PHA) of fledglings hatching from control eggs was negatively related to brood size, whereas there was no such association for fledglings hatching from eggs with experimentally elevated T levels (T fledglings). Male control fledglings showed reduced mass gain compared to female control fledglings within 24 h after the PHA injection. This pattern was reversed in T fledglings. Total antibody levels in fledglings were not affected by egg treatment. Neither cell-mediated immunity nor total antibody levels in sexually mature zebra finches were influenced by egg treatment. However, there was an immuno-enhancing effect of elevated egg T on both primary and secondary humoral immune responses toward diphtheria and tetanus antigens in ca 5 and 7 month old zebra finches. In addition, the covariation between different immune components differed between T and control offspring, suggesting that egg treatment may have altered the potential trade-offs between different parts of the immune system. Our results suggest that prenatal androgens could be an important factor contributing to individual variation in immune function even in adulthood."

A synthesis of all of this work illustrates some contrasting results (e.g. many high-profile results have failed to be replicated), some very common patterns (e.g. investment shifts through the laying sequence), and potentially interesting and complex interactions between traits (e.g. between sex of offspring and hormonal profiles of eggs).

In addition, maternal hormones have been suggested as a mechanism to skew brood sex ratio. This study uses one of the world's most extreme SSD species, the brown songlark Cinclorhamphus cruralis, to investigate (1) sex-specific differences of androgens in yolk and chick plasma and (2) the relationship between androgens and sex ratio bias. The study reveals no indication of sex-specific maternal allocation, but a modest sex effect during the later stages of incubation when the embryo starts to produce its own androgens. Moreover, there was a strong seasonal sex ratio bias: female-biased early and male-biased later in the season, but yolk testosterone (T) did not show a seasonal trend. Taken together these results suggest that if androgens, from any source, have a significant role in development of SSD in this species it is most likely via sex-specific sensitivity or synthesis rather than differential maternal transfer to the egg.

Natal nests accounted for the most variation in population egg size. Within clutches, early-laid eggs were larger than later-laid eggs, with the exception of first-laid eggs, which were small.

In this study, we tested several predictions regarding variation in immunocompetence and distribution of parasites within avian broods by combining parasite removal and carotenoid supplementation treatments in nests of mountain bluebirds Sialia currucoides. Last-hatched nestlings were less likely to invest carotenoids in an induced cell-mediated immune response, suggesting they may be more susceptible to parasites; however, parasite removal disproportionately benefited middle-ranked nestlings. This supports the hypothesis that some avian ectoparasites balance host resistance against nutritional benefits by preferentially parasitizing nestlings of intermediate quality and immunocompetence. We found no evidence that males positioned last in the hatching sequence were differentially affected by ectoparasites, and, contrary to some previous studies in other passerines, last-hatched nestlings in asynchronously hatching broods were not less immunocompetent than their nest mates. In fact, junior nestlings exhibited weaker immune responses than their siblings in more synchronously hatching broods, and we suggest this may reflect environment-dependent maternal effects that warrant further investigation. Overall, our results highlight the importance of understanding the feeding and host selection behaviour of ectoparasites, as well as the fitness consequences thereof, since many predictions related to within-brood distribution of parasites require that parasites are able to discern the relative quality of available hosts."

We investigate in colonial breeding black-headed gulls whether high concentrations of yolk androgens, such as those found in environments with high numbers of social interactions, facilitate aggressiveness and territorial behaviour of the chicks. Black-headed gulls are highly suitable for this, as the semi-precocial chicks defend the natal territory and food against intruders. We manipulated yolk androgen concentrations and investigated their role in both within-nest and between-nest aggression. We found that chicks hatching from androgen-treated eggs defended the natal territory more often than their nest mates from control eggs, without increasing sibling aggression.

We conclude that androgens mediate environmentally induced plasticity in the expression of both parental and offspring traits, which remain correlated as a result of prenatal effects, probably acting within the egg. Offspring can thus adapt their begging intensity to variable family and ecological environments."

However, rather than routinely expecting adaptive variation within all species, the pattern and magnitude of yolk hormone deposition should theoretically relate to variation in life-histories. Here we present data on intra-clutch variation in yolk corticosterone in three species along a developmental continuum (European starling (Sturnus vulgaris): fully altricial; black guillemot (Cepphus grylle): semi-precocial; common eider (Somateria mollissima): fully precocial) to examine how and why variation in life-histories might relate to the evolution of variation in yolk steroids. Starlings and guillemots showed a significant increase in yolk corticosterone across the laying sequence; however, we found no pattern within eider clutches. Moreover, starlings showed the largest difference (94.6\%) in yolk corticosterone between first- and last-laid eggs, whereas guillemots showed a moderate difference (58.9\%). Despite these general species-specific patterns, individuals showed marked variation in the intra-clutch patterns of yolk corticosterone within each species indicating potential differences in intra-clutch flexibility among females. It is well documented that exposure to elevated yolk glucocorticoids reduces offspring quality at birth/hatching in many taxa and it has therefore been proposed that elevated yolk levels may modulate offspring competition and/or facilitate brood reduction under harsh conditions in birds. Our data suggests that intra-clutch variation in yolk corticosterone has the potential to act as an adaptive maternal effect in species where modulation of competition between nest-bound offspring would benefit mothers (starlings and guillemots). However, in precocial species where mothers would not benefit from a modulation of offspring quality, intra-clutch variation in yolk hormones may play little or no adaptive role. While future phylogenetically-controlled studies will be helpful in examining questions of adaptive mechanisms once more data on yolk corticosterone becomes available, our results nonetheless suggest that research on the evolutionary role of yolk hormones can benefit by a prior! incorporating species-specific life-history-driven hypotheses.

So far, experimental results on the involvement of maternal testosterone (T) in offspring sex manipulation are ambiguous. To investigate the effect of T on primary sex ratio and elucidate underlying mechanisms, we elevated circulating T levels in female homing pigeons (Columba livia). During the course of the experiment females produced three clutches-before and during T implantation, and one year after implant removal. Intriguingly, first eggs, but not second eggs of T females were significantly male biased relative to sham-implanted controls. One year after cessation of the treatment the male bias was still present, indicating long-term effects on female reproductive physiology. T treatment did not affect maternal body condition, nor was body condition correlated with offspring sex ratio. Our data on timing of oviposition, lack of infertile eggs, and yolk weight indicate a possible role for sex specific follicle abortion, perhaps in combination with meiotic drive.

We measured corticosterone levels in the albumen of rockhopper penguins, and assessed their relationship with hatching order, human disturbance and laying date. Rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome) lay two eggs, of which the second egg (B-egg) is larger and hatches faster than the first egg (A-egg). The chick hatching from the B-egg is also much more likely to survive than its sibling. Albumen corticosterone concentrations were lower in B-eggs. However, as B-eggs contained more albumen than A-eggs, the total corticosterone deposited in the albumen was not significantly different between the two eggs. Daily disturbance by human observers during albumen production did not influence albumen corticosterone levels. Laying date had an effect on total albumen corticasterone through a higher albumen mass. However, we observed a high individual component in the composition of eggs from the same clutch.

In this study we experimentally manipulated the perceived attractiveness of male starlings Sturnus unicolor by increasing the amount of green material in some nests (a male courtship display in this species). We predicted that, if female investment before laying is related to male attractiveness, experimental females would increase their reproductive investment in response to the addition of plants in their nests when compared to control females. We found that our manipulation caused variations in female reproductive investment in a way that seems to influence offspring quantity but not offspring quality: Females laid larger clutch sizes but not larger eggs when green plant material was added. However, yolk androgens contents were not related to the experimental manipulation. Contrary to expectations, females breeding in experimental nests laid eggs with smaller amounts of eggshell pigments. Interestingly, we found that eggs laid later in the sequence had higher testosterone levels and showed more intense egg colouration than eggs laid earlier in the sequence. These differences at the within-clutch level suggest that selection has favoured compensatory strategies for hatching asynchrony. Alternatively, since nest sabotages by other females are most common at the beginning of laying, this could be seen as female strategy to minimise losses due to nest sabotages. As far as we know, this is the first study to show that an external egg characteristic such as blue-green colouration reflects yolk androgen concentration."

These strategies are maintained by natural selection resulting from spatial and temporal variation in resource abundance and are particularly evident during range expansion. Yet the mechanisms that maintain close alignment of such strategies with resource availability, integrate suites of dispersal traits and generate variability in dispersal propensity are rarely known. Breeding females can influence offspring phenotype in response to changes in current environmental conditions, making maternal effects uniquely suited to bridge fluctuations in resource abundance in the maternal generation and variation in offspring dispersal ability. Western bluebirds' (Sialia mexicana) dependence on nest cavities-an ephemeral resource has led to the evolution of two distinct dispersal phenotypes: aggressive males that disperse and non-aggressive males that remain philopatric and cooperate with their relatives. Over the last 40 years, western bluebirds rapidly expanded their geographical range, providing us with an opportunity to test, in newly established populations, the importance of maternal effects for generating variability in dispersal propensity. Here, I show that, under variable resource conditions, breeding females group offspring of different competitive ability in different positions in the egg-laying order and, consequently, produce aggressive males that are more likely to disperse when resources are low and non-aggressive philopatric males when resources are abundant. I then show experimentally that the association between resource availability and sex-specific birth order is robust across populations. Thus, this maternal effect enables close tracking of resource availability and may explain how variation in dispersal is generated in newly colonized populations. More generally, these results suggest that, as a key source of variation in colonizing phenotypes, maternal effects are of crucial importance for understanding the dynamics of range expansion."

Experimental elevation of yolk corticosterone did not affect hatching success, incubation period or offspring sex ratio. However, corticosterone did have a sex-specific effect on skeletal growth during embryonic development. Male embryos exposed to relatively high levels of corticosterone were smaller on average than control males at hatching whereas females from hormone-treated eggs were larger on average than control females.

Here, we investigated the effects of experimentally elevated yolk testosterone concentrations on growth and reproduction in female canaries. Elevated yolk testosterone concentrations enhanced the post-natal growth rate, but not the asymptotic mass, and reduced the survival probability. The latter may be a consequence of the higher growth rate, which may have rendered females hatching from testosterone-treated eggs (T-females) more vulnerable to harsh environmental conditions. Adult T-females made a larger investment in their clutch by laying more but not heavier eggs than females hatching from control-treated eggs. Our results suggest that the observed long-lasting effect on clutch size relates to changes in the growth trajectory rather than being a direct consequence of testosterone, since studies manipulating early growth conditions obtained similar results. Clearly, further studies are now required in order to investigate the intriguing relationship between yolk testosterone, elevated growth rates, and clutch size."

Social challenge was simulated by presentation of a conspecific female. Experimental females spent more time near the cage and produced eggs with higher androgen concentration, but local breeding density did not affect yolk androgen level. Moreover, we found that females exposed to more intra-specific interactions and those that bred at higher density produced eggs with smaller yolk. These females may be more constrained in foraging time due to more frequent social encounters, and there might be increased competition for food at areas of higher density. In contrast, the present study did not reveal any evidence for the effect of social environment on yolk antioxidant and immunoglobulin levels. However, we found that yolk lutein and immunoglobulin concentrations were related to the female's H/L ratio. Also, yolk lutein and alpha-tocopherol levels showed a seasonal increase and were positively related to the female's plasma carotenoid level. Mothers may incur significant costs by transferring these compounds into the eggs, thus only females in good physiological condition and those that lay eggs later, when food is probably more abundant, could allocate higher amounts to the eggs without compromising their defence mechanisms.

Therefore, to understand song evolution from a life-history perspective, we investigated early ontogenetic effects on song quality. In particular, we focused on maternal effects and sibling competition. In asynchronously hatching bird species, the age hierarchy among nestlings affects physical development due to competition for food; mothers may influence this competition by adjusting their investment in each egg according to its sequence in the laying order. To independently assess these effects, chicks of the Bengalese finch were cross-fostered so that the age hierarchies formed in fostered broods were independent of the laying order. Our results indicate that song quality partially reflects early ontogenetic conditions, whereas song duration and note-type repertoire were independent of either laying order or age hierarchy. The syntactical complexity of note order declined over the laying sequence. This finding suggests that the song learning ability is influenced by within-clutch variation in maternal investment toward eggs. Considering that song syntactical complexity is subject to female preference in the Bengalese finch, it is likely that maternal resource allocation strategies play a role in song evolution."

Maternal androgens may therefore play an important role in sexual selection, since the expression of sexually selected male characters is often androgen-dependent. We experimentally manipulated the yolk androgen concentrations of European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris) eggs. Subsequently we followed 49 unrelated males from hatching until year of first reproduction. We investigated the expression of multiple sexually selected male characters (song, beak color and throat feather characteristics), taking into account whether a trait is androgen-dependent. Elevated levels of yolk androgens affected the length of the embryonic period, but did not modify the expression of either androgen-dependent or androgen-independent sexually selected male characters including song phenotype at adulthood. Thus the most important function of yolk androgens in starlings and possibly other bird species may relate to the early developmental period. The outcome of our study together with the results of our meta-analysis indicates that the effects of yolk androgens on sexually selected male characters may be comparatively small.

Interpreting this result in light of studies of sex steroid hormone involvement in sex determination, they suggested that maternally derived yolk steroid hormones could constrain sex-determining mechanisms in TSD reptiles. We have worked extensively with this species and have routinely incubated clutches at constant temperatures. To test the consistency of high frequency same-sex clutches across different incubation temperatures, we examined our records of clutches at the University of Texas at Austin from 1992 to 2001. We observed that clutches in which eggs were incubated at the same incubation temperature produced mixed-sex clutches as well as same-sex clutches. Furthermore, cases in which eggs within a clutch were separated and incubated at different temperatures produced the expected number of mixed-sex clutches. These results suggest that maternal influences on sex determination are secondary relative to incubation temperature effects."

Although embryonic exposure to maternally derived glucocorticoids (i.e., corticosterone) generally reduces offspring quality, effects may adaptively match maternal quality with offspring demand. We present results from an interannual field experiment in European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) designed explicitly to examine the fitness consequences of exposing offspring to maternally derived stress hormones. We combined a manipulation of yolk corticosterone (yolk injections) with a manipulation of maternal chick-rearing ability (feather clipping of mothers) to quantify the adaptive value of corticosterone-induced offspring phenotypes in relation to maternal quality. We then examined how corticosterone-induced ``matching{''} within this current reproductive attempt affected future fecundity and maternal survival. First, our results provide support that low-quality mothers transferring elevated corticosterone to eggs invest in daughters as predicted by sex allocation theory. Second, corticosterone-mediated sex-biased investment resulted in rapid male-biased mortality resulting in brood reduction, which provided a better match between maternal quality and brood demand. Third, corticosterone-mediated matching reduced investment in current reproduction for low-quality mothers, resulting in fitness gains through increased survival and future fecundity. Results indicate that the transfer of stress hormones to eggs by low-quality mothers can be adaptive since corticosterone-mediated sex-biased investment matches the quality of a mother to offspring demand, ultimately increasing maternal fitness. Our results also indicate that the branding of the proximate effects of maternal glucocorticoids on offspring as negative ignores the possibility that short-term phenotypic changes may actually increase maternal fitness."

This hypothesis is based in the antioxidant properties of biliverdin whose costly deposition in the eggshell is expected to signal female antioxidant capacity and egg quality. Since maternally derived androgens are costly to produce and may adaptively affect offspring phenotype, high-quality females may benefit by signalling their androgen investment through egg colouration. Our aim was to investigate whether egg colour variation in the spotless starling reflected the amount of pigments on the eggshell and whether egg pigmentation was related to female and egg quality. Chromatography analyses revealed that spotless starling eggshells contained two different pigments: biliverdin and protoporphyrin IX with no correlation between them. Biliverdin contents correlated positively with egg colouration indicating that darker eggs with a higher peak in the blue-green segment of the spectrum contained higher amounts of biliverdin. Eggs containing more biliverdin were laid by high-quality females and contained higher yolk testosterone levels. However, despite the strong correlation between biliverdin and colorimetric variables, egg colouration did not reflect accurately female and egg quality. Our results provide evidence that eggshell pigmentation in the spotless starling is related to female and egg quality as shown by the yolk testosterone levels.

In the blue-footed booby, male feet colour is a dynamic condition-dependent sexually selected trait that is related to paternal effort. During two consecutive years, an El Nino year (poor breeding conditions) and a year with good breeding conditions, we experimentally reduced male attractiveness by modifying their feet colour after the first egg was laid and recorded female investment in the second egg. We found that, relative to the first egg in the clutch, females laid heavier second eggs during the poor year than during the good year. Females paired with males with duller feet colour reduced second-egg mass and volume and delayed the laying of the second egg, independently of the year. Absolute yolk androstenedione (A4) concentration (but not testosterone, T) in second eggs was higher during a poor year than during a good year. Only during a year with poor breeding conditions, females paired with experimental males decreased the relative A4 concentration (but not T) in the second egg compared to control females.

Given that yolk steroids can significantly affect offspring phenotype and that in many species the levels of yolk steroids have been found to increase with laying order, the maternal transfer of steroids to egg yolk has been proposed as a mechanism for females to offset the deleterious effects of ASH. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether yolk steroids varied with laying order or clutch size in Common Grackles (Quiscalus quiscula). Because ASH varies with clutch size (hatching span averages 48 h in five-egg clutches, 24 h in four-egg clutches) and regularly results in the starvation of later hatched nestlings, we predicted: (1) testosterone and 17 beta-estradiol levels should increase with laying order in both clutch sizes to mitigate the negative effects of ASH on last-hatched nestlings, and (2) the increase should be greater in five-egg clutches due to more pronounced hatching asynchrony. Using a competitive-binding steroid radioimmunoassay, we found no systematic variation in either testosterone or estradiol levels relative to laying order or clutch size. In the absence of evidence that yolk steroids interact adaptively with ASH, research must look elsewhere for potential benefits that might compensate for the costs these steroids impose on nestlings."

Research in laboratory mammals has suggested that maternally-induced stress can cause significant variation in the responsiveness of an offspring's HPA axis involving both pre- and post-natal developmental mechanisms. However, very little is known regarding effects of maternal stress on the variability of offspring adrenocortical functioning in free-living vertebrates. Here we use an experimental approach that independently lowers the quality of both the pre- and post-natal developmental environment to examine programming and plasticity in the responsiveness of the HPA axis in fledglings of a free-living passerine, the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris). We found that mimicking a hormonal signal of poor maternal condition via an experimental prenatal increase in yolk corticosterone decreased the subsequent responsiveness of the HPA axis in fledglings. Conversely, decreasing the quality of the post-natal developmental environment (by decreasing maternal provisioning capability via a maternal feather-clipping manipulation) increased subsequent responsiveness of the HPA axis in fledglings, apparently through direct effects on nestling body condition. The plasticity of these responses was sex-specific with smaller female offspring showing the largest increase in HPA reactivity. We suggest that pre-natal, corticosterone-induced, plasticity in the HPA axis may be a `predictive adaptive response' (PAR): a form of adaptive developmental plasticity where the advantage of the induced phenotype is manifested in a future life-history stage. Further, we introduce a new term to define the condition-driven post-natal plasticity of the HPA axis to an unpredictable post-natal environment, namely a `reactive adaptive response' (RAR). This study confirms that the quality of both the pre- and post-natal developmental environment can be a significant source of variation in the responsiveness of the HPA axis, and provides a frame-work for examining ecologically-relevant sources of stress-induced programming and plasticity in this endocrine system in a free-living vertebrate, respectively.

Because most avian studies have focused on multi-egg clutch species, and interpreted results within the framework of sibling competition, we still know little about how yolk androgens might be allocated in direct response to environmental conditions. Most oceanic birds are long-lived and lay single-egg clutches, and their breeding success is tightly linked to highly variable marine production. That combination: a variable breeding environment, long lives, and single-egg clutches, makes oceanic birds good subjects to test hypotheses about yolk androgen allocation strategies. We measured concentrations of two yolk androgens, androstenedione (A4) and testosterone (T), in the single-egg clutches laid by early-laying Cassin's (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) and rhinoceros (Cerorhinca monocerata) auklets at Triangle Island, British Columbia, Canada, in 2002-2004. Environmental conditions including sea-surface temperatures and the timing and intensity of marine primary production varied over the 3 years, and in response, both the timing and success of seabird breeding varied. As in other avian species, concentrations of A4 and T varied markedly among individual eggs in both species (by factors of 3-8), yet contrary to expectation, little of the variation could be attributed to year effects. The high interindividual variation and the lack of interannual variation suggest a non-adaptive explanation for yolk androgen deposition relative to environmental conditions in these species.

To test this hypothesis, we experimentally blocked the effects of maternal yolk androgens by an injection of the antiandrogen flutamide or a control substance in the eggs of great tits, Parus major. We subsequently manipulated the food demand of the brood in a brood size manipulation experiment, and recorded the parental feeding rates. The males' food-provisioning rates were not significantly influenced by the actions of maternal yolk androgens, whereas females adjusted their parental effort to androgen-mediated nestling signals, in particular in enlarged broods. These results show that female great tits do not exploit the male's contribution to parental care by allocating high concentrations of yolk androgens to their eggs.

The first studies on the functional consequences of maternal yolk androgens have focused on early life stages and their role in sibling competition. However, recent longitudinal studies reported long-lasting effects of maternal yolk androgens on offspring phenotype, mostly concerning traits that are sensitive to androgens. This suggests that maternal yolk androgens could play an important role in sexual selection, since the expression of many male sexual characters is testosterone-dependent. Using male canaries as a model, we examined the consequences of an experimental elevation of yolk testosterone concentrations on early development as well as long-lasting effects particularly on song, which is one of the most important sexual characters in male songbirds. Elevated yolk testosterone concentrations inhibited male growth, possibly in interaction with an existent ectoparasite exposure. Males hatched from testosterone-treated eggs (T-males) did not have enhanced competitive skills, in contrast to previous studies. The elevation of yolk testosterone concentrations delayed song development but did not affect adult song phenotype. This is intriguing, as yolk testosterone possibly induced developmental stress, which is known to reduce song quality. We hypothesize that yolk testosterone has either no direct effect on adult song phenotype, or that positive effects are merged by the negative effects of developmental stress. Finally, females mated with T-males invested more in their clutch indicating that females either assess T-males as more attractive (differential allocation hypothesis) or compensated for lower offspring viability (compensation hypothesis).

We discuss several hypotheses concerning these mechanisms, point out their relevance for ecological and evolutionary interpretations, and review the relevant data. We first examine whether maternal hormones can accumulate in the egg independently of changes in hormone concentrations in the maternal circulation. This is important for Darwinian selection and female physiological trade-offs, and possible mechanisms for hormone accumulation in the egg, which may differ among hormones, are reviewed. Although independent regulation of plasma and yolk concentrations of hormones is conceivable, the data are as yet inconclusive for ovarian hormones. Next, we discuss embryonic utilization of maternal steroids, since enzyme and receptor systems in the embryo may have coevolved with maternal effect mechanisms in the mother. We consider dose response relationships and action pathways of androgens and argue that these considerations may help to explain the apparent lack of interference of maternal steroids with sexual differentiation. Finally, we discuss mechanisms underlying the pleiotropic actions of maternal steroids, since linked effects may influence the coevolution of parent and offspring traits, owing to their role in the mediation of physiological trade-offs. Possible mechanisms here are interactions with other hormonal systems in the embryo. We urge endocrinologists to embark on suggested mechanistic studies and behavioural ecologists to adjust their interpretations to accommodate the current knowledge of mechanisms."

Parents, mothers in particular, may influence incubation periods and resulting offspring quality through proximate pathways, while variation in maternal strategies among species can result from selection by adult and offspring mortality. Parents of long-lived species, as is common in the tropics and subtropics, may be under selection to minimize costs to themselves during incubation. Indeed, time spent incubating is often lower in the tropical and subtropical species than the related north temperate species, causing cooler average egg temperatures in the southern regions. Decreased egg temperatures result in longer incubation periods and reflect a cost imposed on offspring by parents because energy cost to the embryo and risk of offspring predation are both increased. Mothers may adjust egg size and constituents as a means to partially offset such costs. For example, reduced androgen concentrations in egg yolks may slow development rates, but may enhance offspring quality through physiological trade-offs that may be particularly beneficial in longer-lived species, as in the tropics and subtropics. We provide initial data to show that yolks of tropical birds contain substantially lower concentrations of growth-promoting androgens than north temperate relatives.

Carotenoids on the other hand are suggested to be beneficial because they can counteract the oxidative stress and the immune-depressive effect of T. In this study we analyzed the effect of prenatal T exposure in the grey partridge. We injected eggs with three doses of T (high, intermediate, and physiological). After hatching, chicks exposed to a prenatal high dose of T were fed with two diets (rich or poor) differing in beta-carotene content. We found a significant effect of T on both chick growth and cell-mediated immunity, with high T doses resulting in detrimental effects while low doses were beneficial. Detrimental effects of the high dose of T on immunity were mitigated by P-carotene consumed in the diet. The differences between groups were observed in the early period of life (age 10 days for mass, and age 10 and 21 days for immunity), and disappeared in the following period, and up to 1 and 2years later. Overall, our observations show that T in the egg is not detrimental but beneficial, and that negative effects are found only at supraphysiological concentrations.

Testosterone is present in both sexes and implanting it can provoke a rise of individual aggressiveness leading consequently to an increase of social status. Many researchers have studied the relationship between plasma testosterone and dominance but few have focused on yolk testosterone and social hierarchy. Thus we aimed to study the possible influence of the mother's social status on egg yolk testosterone deposition. Our hypothesis is that dominant females lay eggs containing more testosterone than subordinate females. We recorded the social hierarchy of 24 female domesticated canaries, Serinus canaria, and studied the influence of their social status on the concentration of testosterone in their egg yolks and on other egg characteristics. Our results show a significant relationship between a mother's social status and the amount of testosterone deposited in its yolks: the more dominant the females are, the more concentrated in testosterone their eggs are. Our results also show that yolk testosterone increases with laying order, whereas no relationship between mothers' rank number and their clutch size or egg mass was found.

However, the proposed mechanisms of steroid effects are thought to differ between TSD and GSD: a direct effect of oestrogens on gonad feminisation in TSD species vs a differential induction of male-producing or female-producing gametes in GSD species. Geckos offer an ideal opportunity for testing these suggested mechanisms. Closely related gecko species differ in their modes of sex determination. They lay clutches of two synchronously formed eggs; both eggs share equal steroid levels. If identical hormonal composition and environment during vitellogenesis, gravidity and incubation determine the sex of the progeny, siblings should share the same gender in both TSD and GSD geckos. We found strong support for this prediction in a TSD gecko species. Among clutches that were incubated at the temperature that produced both sexes, there were no clutches with siblings of the opposite sex. On the other hand, about half of the clutches yielded siblings of the opposite sex in four GSD species. These results suggest that sex-determining systems constrain the ability of the female to produce single-sex siblings and, hence, it seems that the GSD mechanism constrains the opportunities for sex ratio manipulation in geckos via yolk steroid manipulation."

These findings, together with discoveries from other species that the effects of yolk androgens on growth of female nestlings may differ from their effects on growth of male nestlings, raise the hypothesis that natural changes in yolk-androgen concentrations with laying order are ultimately due to a difference between the sexes in their yolk-androgen sensitivity and between early- and late-laid eggs in their sex ratio. By re-analyzing previously published data and adding to the analysis data from previously unanalyzed blood samples used for sex determination, we investigated possible sex-specific effects of yolk-androgens in the context of a potential sex-biased laying order in free-living American kestrels. We used a multi-level, mixed model with a Gompertz function to analyze growth of nestlings hatching from a-eggs that were control-treated or in which we experimentally elevated yolk-androgen concentrations shortly after laying to the higher concentrations naturally found in later-laid eggs. We discovered that male nestlings were more susceptible than female nestlings to growth inhibition by yolk-androgen elevation but did not find a bias in sex ratio with respect to laying order. Together, these findings do not support the above hypothesis. However, they are consistent with the hypothesis that sex differences in yolk-androgen sensitivity enable mothers to economically tune reproductive effort to an individual offspring's reproductive value, which can vary more for one sex than the other."

Two dominant hypotheses about the function of yolk androgens in avian eggs concern maternal manipulation of sibling competition and post hatching paternal care. In megapodes, however, neither sibling competition nor post hatching parental care exists. Eggs are incubated by external heat sources, and chicks dig themselves out of their underground nest and live independently of their parents and their siblings. In this first study on egg androgens of such a megapode, the Australian Brush-turkey Alectura lathami, we found nevertheless substantial amounts of maternal androgens. Since size of the incubation mound, incubation temperature, egg size and laying date greatly vary in this species, we analysed variation in testosterone (T), androstenedione (A4) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in relation to these factors. T concentrations were significantly higher in eggs from bigger mounds and laid at greater depth, which may compensate via anabolic effects for the longer duration and higher energetic requirements of chicks when digging themselves out. T concentrations were higher in smaller eggs, and both yolk A4 and T concentrations increased with laying date, perhaps as a compensatory measure, while DHT concentrations only varied across different mounds. These results indicate that maternal androgens may influence offspring development outside the contexts of sibling competition or parental care. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

First, we found no relationship between concentrations or amounts of yolk androgens and carotenoids. Yolk carotenoids decreased with laying order, whereas we found no relationship between yolk androgens and laying order. Second, we tested the Investment Hypothesis, which predicts that high-quality females or females paired to high quality mates, allocate differentially more of these yolk compounds to their offspring. For carotenoids, we mostly found evidence to counter predictions of the Investment hypothesis: (1) Carotenoid concentrations varied among females, (2) heavier eggs contained lower carotenoid concentrations, although heavier yolks contained greater amounts of carotenoids, (3) eggs of earlier-laying females had lower concentrations in their eggs, and (4) yolk carotenoids were not correlated with clutch size or male plumage ornamentation. For androgens, we found weak support for the Investment Hypothesis: (1) Yolk androgens varied among females, (2) heavier eggs and yolks contained greater amounts, although not concentrations of androgens, (3) females paired to more colorful males laid eggs with greater concentrations of androgens, and (4) no effects of laying date or morphological correlates of female quality on androgen concentrations in egg yolks.

Testosterone (T) levels increased significantly with increasing density. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels increased with the number of nest boxes available.

Within-female yolk androgen levels were highly consistent over two consecutive years even though females were breeding in opposite breeding densities during each year, suggesting that individual characteristics are important determinants of variation in maternal androgen allocation in addition to potential effects of environmental conditions.

We examined yolk testosterone (T) concentrations in eggs of the smooth-billed ani (Crotophaga ani) to understand patterns of androgen deposition in eggs of this plural-breeding joint-nesting cooperatively breeding species. We tested the hatching; asynchrony adjustment hypothesis, which states that increases in yolk androgen levels over the laying sequence function to mitigate the disadvantage of being a later-hatched chick in species without adaptive brood reduction. We also investigated the effect of group size on yolk T deposition to test the hypothesis that females in multi-female groups could give a competitive edge to their own chicks by depositing higher T levels in their eggs. Predictions of the hatching asynchrony adjustment hypothesis were supported in both single- and multi-female groups as yolk testosterone levels increased from early- to late-laid eggs. This suggests that ani females can influence nestling competition and chick survival by within-clutch differential T allocation. Unexpectedly, we did not observe an effect of group size on yolk T deposition. Yolk testosterone concentrations may not be a mere reflection of a female's hormonal status as female plasma circulating levels of T did not vary in the same direction as yolk T levels.

However, current hypotheses lack supporting information on both intra- and inter-clutch variation in yolk corticosterone for wild birds. As such, we examined variation in yolk corticosterone levels in a wild population of European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). Maternal condition, clutch size and nesting density were all negatively related to yolk conicosterone deposition, females with high condition indices, those laying larger clutches and those nesting in high-density associations deposited lower amounts of the lion-none into eggs than those with low condition indices, laying small clutches and nesting in isolation. Alternatively, we found no effects of maternal age or human disturbance on yolk corticosterone deposition. Intra-clutch variation of yolk corticosterone was significant, with levels increasing across the laying sequence in all clutch sizes examined, with the difference between first and last-laid eggs being greater in large versus small clutches. Given the reported effects of yolk corticosterone on offspring size and growth, intra-clutch variation in yolk corticosterone has the potential to alter the competitive environment within a brood. Furthermore, our results indicate that variation in yolk corticosterone can originate from variation in both the mother's quality as well as the quality of her breeding environment. The presence of inter-female variation in particular is an important pre-requisite in testing whether the exposure of offspring to maternally-derived corticosterone is a mechanistic link between offspring phenotypic plasticity and maternal quality.

Offspring hatched from either T-treated or control eggs were subjected to a sequential series of behavioral tests in which we measured the neophobic response and its persistence towards two unfamiliar stimuli. Birds from T-treated and control eggs did not differ in their latencies to approach and eat a novel food source during their first encounter. However, egg treatment affected subsequent habituation. Latencies decreased in both groups over a habituation period of 5 days, but considerably more so in T-offspring. Although males appeared to approach novel food faster than females, there was no overall sex effect during the habituation period. When a novel object was added in combination with the previously learned food stimulus, this caused an behavioral shift in approach latencies. In males, control offspring had significantly shorter latencies than T-offspring, whereas there was no difference among females. The latency to eat in the same test was not significantly affected by sex or egg treatment. Our results demonstrate long-term effects of prenatal T on neophobic responses in adult zebra finches.

Accordingly, we tested the effect of embryonic corticosterone exposure (5.5 ng/ml egg) and intermittent handling after hatching on the behaviour and growth of 88 vehicle-treated (40 males and 48 females) and 88 corticosterone-treated (40 males and 48 females) chicks.

We examined correlations between naturally occurring yolk steroid levels and offspring traits in the scincid lizard Bassiana duperreyi, and also conducted experimental trials (exogenous application of testosterone or 17 beta-oestradiol to eggs) to test for causal effects of hormones.

However, although variation within Clutches in yolk androgens is relatively well understood, the adaptive significance of patterns of variation between clutches remains rather unclear. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that yolk androgens act as a means of an adaptive maternal effect to adjust offspring to a given posthatching environment. Thus, the consequences of maternal yolk androgens for offspring development are likely to depend on the specific environment of a given brood. We experimentally manipulated yolk androgen concentrations in spotless starling eggs, using a between-brood design in which full broods were manipulated applying either an androgen or sham treatment, in order to test the effects of between-brood variation in yolk androgen levels. We also included in the analysis several female characters that have been shown to affect androgen deposition. Androgen-chicks tended to gain more mass, a similar effect to that shown in previous studies where direct competition between chicks belonging to different treatments was allowed, but did not gain a survival benefit. Androgen-chicks had wider beak flanges, an effect that has not been described previously and could play an important role in food acquisition. In addition, androgen-chicks had higher endogenous plasma levels of androgens, which could induce higher begging intensity. We hypothesize that these effects are an important mechanistic link for our understanding of how yolk androgens exert their effects on offspring development after hatching. Contrary to our predictions, we found no evidence that the observed effects depended on the environment under which it was investigated. Because high yolk androgen levels seem to be beneficial for nestlings in this species, we hypothesize that yolk hormone deposition could be costly for females or alternatively that potential negative effects later in adulthood may constrain maternal hormone allocation."

However, contrary to commonly accepted assumptions of size-dependent vulnerability, the smaller sex (male) is more vulnerable to developmental stress caused by sibling competition. We investigated whether maternal investment would be biased by the position in laying order and the sex of eggs, and also explored the possible differences in growth patterns depending on sex, laying order, and age hierarchy by observing chicks fostered to experimentally manipulated broods where brood composition was controlled and age hierarchy was more enhanced than in natural breeding conditions. We found that overall patterns of maternal investment favored the disadvantageous sectors of sibling competition, i.e., eggs of later laying order and sons over those of early laying order and daughters. We also examined the effect of laying order on adult body size and sex differences in growth patterns. When reared in the subordinate age hierarchy, females could compensate for the deficit of decreased growth rate by taking longer to mature, whereas males could not.

Here, we show experimentally that elevated levels of prenatal testosterone increase resting metabolic rate in nestling zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata).

We investigated proximate determinants of SSD in several species of squamate reptiles, including three species of Sceloporus lizards and the diamond-backed rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox). In natural populations of these species, SSD is caused by sexual differences in age-specific growth. Males and females, however, may often share similar potentials for growth: growth is strongly responsive to the availability of food, and sexual differences in growth can be greatly suppressed or completely absent under common environmental conditions in the laboratory. Sexually divergent growth is expressed in natural environments because of inherent ecological differences between males and females and because of potential epigenetic effects of sex-specific growth regulators. In field-active Sceloporus, sexual differences in growth rate are associated with sexual divergence in plasma testosterone. Experiments confirm that testosterone inhibits growth in species in which females are larger (for example, S. undulatus and S. virgatus) and stimulates growth in those in which males are larger (for example, S. jarrovii). Interestingly, however, sexual divergence in plasma testosterone is not accompanied by divergence in growth in S. jarrovii or in male-larger C. atrox in the laboratory. Furthermore, experimental effects of castration and testosterone replacement on growth are not evident in captive S. jarrovii, possibly because growth effects of testosterone are superseded by an abundant, high-quality diet. In female-larger S. undulatus, growth may be traded-off against testosterone-induced reproductive costs of activity. In male-larger species, costs of reproduction in terms of growth are suggested by supplemental feeding of reproductive female C. atrox in their natural environment and by experimental manipulation of reproductive cost in female S. jarrovii. Growth costs of reproduction, however, do not contribute substantially to the development of SSD in male-larger S. jarrovii. We conclude that the energetic costs of testosterone-induced, male reproductive behavior may contribute substantially to the development of SSD in some female-larger species. However, despite strong evidence that reproductive investment exacts a substantial cost in growth, we do not support the reproductive cost hypothesis as a general explanation of SSD in male-larger species."

Ornithologists distinguish species with ``obligate{''} and ``facultative{''} siblicide. Sibling aggression was described in some mammal species: the domestic pig (Sits scrofa), the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), and the Iberian lynx (L. pardinus). In all of them, sibling aggression corresponds well with the ``facultative{''} siblicide model in birds. Sibling aggression was observed at the age of 36-64 days in both lynx species. It is usually restricted to a single fight and can change the hierarchical structure and growth rate of the kittens. In the spotted hyena and the domestic pig, the frequency and intensity of aggressive interactions between siblings are strongest during the first days of postnatal ontogeny and then decrease gradually. The newborns of these species are much developed than newborn lynx kittens. Usually adult lynx females, in contrast to hyenas and pigs, try to stop sibling fights. This is probably related to the larger parental investment at the time of the fight in lynxes (a kitten's body weight is about 10\% of the mother's) than in pigs (0.5\%) and hyenas (1.9\%). Sibling aggression in spotted hyenas could be related to the high level of androstenedione and is not related to testosterone concentration. In the Eurasian lynx, female sibs attack their littermates slightly more often than male sibs do, and sibling aggression is not testosterone-dependent. Hormones secreted by the adrenal glands may play an important role in this phenomenon. The data available so far, however, do not positively confirm the presence of hormonal trigger effects in mammal sibling aggression."

We measured growth rate and cellular immune response of nestlings that hatched from eggs laid by females injected with testosterone during egg laying and nestlings of unaffected control females. We found that sons of testosterone-treated females grew slower in comparison to sons of control females. The significant interaction between experimental group and offspring sex indicates that sons of testosterone-treated mothers suffered impaired immune responsiveness while daughters seemed to benefit from elevated androgen level in terms of enhanced immune responsiveness. We found no effects of androgens on offspring performance at adulthood-neither fecundity of females nor attractiveness of males was affected. We conclude that the benefits of biasing sex ratio towards males by increasing androgen level in the yolk may be limited due to negative effects on male offspring performance early in life."

However, two nonexclusive evolutionary hypotheses predict an interspecific relationship between egg testosterone levels and the elaboration of sexual traits. First, maternal investment may be particularly enhanced in sexually selected species, which should generate a positive relationship. Secondly, high prenatal testosterone levels may constrain the development of sexual characters, which should result in a negative relationship. Here we investigated these hypotheses by exploring the relationship between yolk testosterone levels and features of song in a phylogenetic study of 36 passerine species. We found that song duration and syllable repertoire size were significantly negatively related to testosterone levels in the egg, even if potentially confounding factors were held constant. These relationships imply that high testosterone levels during early development of songs may be detrimental, thus supporting the developmental constraints hypothesis. By contrast, we found significant evidence that song-post exposure relative to the height of the vegetation is positively related to egg testosterone levels. These results support the hypothesis that high levels of maternal testosterone have evolved in species with intense sexual selection acting on the location of song-posts.

To date, the field has been dominated by the idea that mothers use yolk hormones to adaptively adjust offspring development, a view that assigns control over hormone deposition and its effects on the offspring to the mother. This neglects the possibility that the evolutionary interests of the mother and offspring differ. When there is such parent-offspring conflict, the offspring are selected to respond to the hormones in a way that is adaptive for themselves rather than for the mother. Moreover, sexual conflict between the parents over parental investment may shape the evolution of yolk hormone deposition: females may manipulate the male's contribution to parental care through the effect of yolk hormones on offspring begging, competitiveness, and developmental rate.

It has been proposed that mothers adaptively adjust hormone levels experienced by particular young to optimize their reproductive output. In birds, systematic variation in egg hormone levels has been related to different female reproductive strategies. Because in many bird species prospects of the offspring change seasonally and with brood number, strategic adjustment of yolk androgen levels would be expected. To test this idea, we induced pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) females to nest twice during the same season by removing their first clutches shortly after clutch completion. We collected eggs of first and replacement clutches to measure yolk concentrations of androstenedione (A4) and testosterone (T) and captured the females that laid these clutches for phenotypic measurements. Although average egg androgen levels were remarkably consistent within females, hormone patterns differed considerably between first and replacement clutches. Eggs of replacement clutches were heavier with larger yolks compared to first clutches, but they contained on average lower levels of androgens. Within clutches, androgen concentration increased over the laying sequence in the first clutch, but decreased or remained more constant over the laying sequence in the replacement clutch. Mean yolk T, but not A4 levels, were negatively associated with laying date for both breeding attempts. Moreover, females in good body condition produced eggs containing lower levels of androgens than females in poor condition. Our results are consistent with the idea that differences in yolk androgen levels may be one mechanism underlying seasonal variation in reproductive success and it is possible that changes in egg androgen patterns may reflect a change in female reproductive strategy. High within-female consistency also highlights the possibility that there may be some underlying genetic variation in yolk androgen levels."

Females maintained on a poor-quality diet produced fewer clutches but massively (twofold) larger eggs with lower concentrations of yolk testosterone than did conspecific females given a high-quality diet. Although all eggs were incubated at the same temperature, and yolk steroid hormone levels were not correlated with offspring sex, the nutrient-deprived females produced highly male-biased sex ratios among their offspring. These responses to maternal nutrition generate a link between sex and offspring size, in a direction likely to enhance maternal fitness if large body size enhances reproductive success more in sons than in daughters (as seems plausible, given the mating system of this species). Overall, our results showthat sex determination in these animals is more complex, and responsive to a wider range of environmental cues, than that suggested by the classification of `environmental sex determination'."

Therefore, their allocation to the eggs may be influenced by the female's condition, age and environmental circumstances. Furthermore, the quality of the male parent, which affects the reproductive value of the offspring, may also influence this investment. In this correlational study, we investigated proximate and ultimate factors that may lead to variation in yolk lutein, zeaxanthin and beta-carotene concentrations among and within clutches of a wild passerine, the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis). We found that carotenoid concentration was positively associated with caterpillar supply at the time of egg formation, which suggests a proximate constraint of carotenoid availability on yolk composition. Neither female condition, body size, age, nor male plumage ornamentation, age and body size correlated with carotenoid deposition. Yolk beta-carotene concentration was found to be positively linked to yolk testosterone concentration. We suggest that females allocated more beta-carotene to their eggs to mitigate the potentially detrimental effects of elevated steroid concentration. We found that concentration of beta-carotene increased with laying order.

There is currently great interest among behavioural ecologists in maternally allocated yolk androgens, especially their relationship with offspring sex and development. Such studies need embryonic tissue for sexing, however, requiring eggs to be incubated (usually for 3 days). Therefore, there are concerns about whether the androgen concentrations assayed reflect those allocated by the mother. In addition, studies showing sex biases in maternal allocation of androgens could be confounded if male and female embryos uptake or metabolise androgens at different rates. We ran a series of experiments using zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) eggs to address these potential confounding factors. First we showed, using eggs naturally incubated for up to 5 days, that eggs containing embryos had lower yolk androgen concentrations than eggs that had failed to form embryos. We then tested various hypotheses for this difference using controlled incubation treatments. Our results suggested that (a) embryo development causes the yolk to become progressively more diluted with albumin; and (b) between 3 and 5 days of incubation embryos start uptaking or metabolising androgens. Crucially, we found no decline in yolk androgen concentration at 3 days incubation, and no evidence for sex-specific rates of uptake or metabolism of androgens. This strongly suggests that yolk androgen levels up to 3 days incubation do reflect those allocated by the mother, and that studies of sex biased maternal allocation of yolk androgens are not confounded by sex differences in embryo development.

Here we show that different dispersal strategies maximize the reproductive success of young great tits (Parus major) originating from a parasite-infested or a parasite-free nest and demonstrate that differential transfer of maternal yolk androgens in response to parasitism can result in a modification of the offspring's dispersal behavior that appears adaptive.

Thus, developmental traits that depend on the parental effort exerted (pre- and postnatal growth rate) should scale positively with adult mortality, in contrast to those that do not have a direct relationship with parental investment (timing of developmental events, e.g. nest leaving). I tested this prediction on a sample of 84 North American songbirds. Nestling growth rate scaled positively and incubation period duration negatively with annual adult mortality rates even when controlled for nest predation and other covariates, including phylogeny.

Such constraints are supported by the interspecific relationship between ontological differences and relative brain size in birds and mammals. Given that mothers can strongly influence the development of the offspring via maternal effects that potentially involve substances essential for growing brains, we argue that such effects may represent an important but overlooked component of developmental constraints on brain size. To demonstrate the importance of maternal effect on the evolution of brains, we investigated the interspecific relationship between relative brain size and maternal effects, as reflected by yolk testosterone, carotenoids, and vitamins A and E in a phylogenetic study of birds. Females of species with relatively large brains invested more in eggs in terms of testosterone and vitamin E than females of species with small brains. The effects of carotenoid and vitamin A levels on the evolution of relative brain size were weaker and non-significant. The association between relative brain size and yolk testosterone was curvilinear, suggesting that very high testosterone levels can be suppressive. However, at least in moderate physiological ranges, the positive relationship between components of maternal effects and relative brain size may imply one aspect of developmental costs of large brains. The relationship between vitamin E and relative brain size was weakened when we controlled for developmental mode, and thus the effect of this antioxidant may be indirect. Testosterone-enhanced neurogenesis and vitamin Emediated defence against oxidative stress may have key functions when the brain of the embryo develops, with evolutionary consequences for relative brain size.

According to life-history theory, reproduction is costly, and individuals that invest too much in a given reproductive bout pay with reduced reproductive output in the future. Likewise, investing , too little does not maximize reproductive potential. Because reproductive effort relative to output can vary with predictable and unpredictable challenges and opportunities, no single level of reproductive effort maximizes fitness. This leads to the prediction that individuals possessing behavioural mechanisms to buffer challenges and take advantage of opportunities would incur fitness benefits. Here, we review evidence in birds, primarily of altricial species, for the presence of at least two such mechanisms and evidence for and against the seasonal coordination of these mechanisms through seasonal changes in plasma concentrations of the pituitary hormone prolactin. First, the seasonal decline in clutch size of most bird species may partially offset a predictable seasonal decline in the reproductive value of offspring. Second, establishing a developmental sibling-hierarchy among offspring may), hedge against unpredictable changes in resource availability and offspring viability or quality, and minimize energy), expenditure in raising a brood. The hierarchy may be a product, in part, of the timing of incubation onset relative to clutch completion and the rate of yolk androgen deposition during the laying cycle. Because clutch size should influence the effects of both these traits on the developmental hierarchy, we predicted and describe evidence in some species that females adjust the timing of incubation onset and rate of yolk androuen deposition to match clutch size. Studies on domesticated precocial species reveal an inhibitory effect of the pituitary hormone prolactin on egg layin 9, suggesting a possible hormonal basis for the regulation of clutch size. Studies on the American kestrel (Falco sparverius) and other species suggest that the seasonal increase in plasma concentrations of prolactin may regulate both a seasonal advance in the timing of incubation onset and a seasonal increase in the rate of yolk androgen deposition. These observations, together with strong conceptual arguments published previously, raise the possibility that a single hormone, prolactin, functions as the basis of a common mechanism for the seasonal adjustment of reproductive effort. However, a role for prolactin in regulating, clutch size in any species is not firmly established, and evidence from some species indicates that clutch size may not be coupled to the timing of incubation onset and rate of yolk androgen deposition. A dissociation between the regulation of clutch size and the regulation of incubation onset and yolk androgen deposition may enable an independent response to the predictable and unpredictable challenges and opportunities faced during reproduction."

When relative importance of these effects varies across environments, evolution of developmental periods is expected to be slow. In birds, maternal effects on egg-laying order and offspring growth, two proximate determinants of nestling period, should enable rapid adjustment of developmental periods to even widely fluctuating mortality rates. We test this hypothesis in a population of house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) breeding under two contrasting mortality risks: (i) a nest mite-free condition when selection on offspring survival favors a longer time in the nest; and (it) a mite infestation when selection favors a shorter nest tenure. Mites affected survival of sons more than daughters, and females breeding under mite infestation laid male eggs last and female eggs first in the clutch, thereby reducing sons' exposure to mites and associated mortality. Strong sex bias in laying order and growth patterns enabled mite-infested offspring to achieve similar fledging size, despite a shorter nest tenure, compared with mite-free conditions. In mite-infested nests, male nestlings hatched at larger sizes, completed growth earlier, and had faster initial growth compared with mite-free nests, whereas mite-infested females grew more slowly but for a longer period of time. A combination of heavily sex-biased laying order and sex differences in growth patterns lowered mite-induced mortality by > 10\% in both sexes. Thus, strong maternal effects can account for frequently observed, but theoretically unexpected, concordance of mortality risks and growth patterns, especially under fluctuating ecological conditions."

We found that T embryos produced louder embryonic vocalizations than controls, whereas structural properties and the calling rate did not differ between T and control embryos. The post-hatch begging rate was unaffected by T treatment, but strongly decreased with increasing chick body mass, suggesting that intensity of the begging display was sensitive to chick state and may therefore reliably indicate the need of food in this species.

Two house finch populations at the northern and southern boundaries of the species range have opposite ovulation sequences of male and female eggs, and thus, in the absence of sex differences in ova growth or sex-specific maternal strategies, would be expected to have opposite sex-specific accumulation of maternal products. We found that the populations had strong and similar gradients of steroid distribution in relation to ovulation order, whereas distribution of carotenoids and vitamins correlated with each follicle's accumulation of steroids. In both populations, temporal bias in production of sons and daughters within a clutch enabled strongly sex-specific acquisition of maternal products, and oocytes of the same sex were highly interdependent in their accumulation of steroids. Moreover, in nests where the sex-bias in relation to ovulation order deviated from population-specific patterns, eggs had highly distinct concentrations of steroids, carotenoids and vitamins.

Yolk antioxidant and immunoglobulin concentrations decreased across the laying order, while yolk testosterone concentrations increased. This may substantially handicap the immune defence of last-hatched chicks. The decrease in antioxidant levels was greater when mothers had a low body mass and when the increase in testosterone concentrations was relatively large. This suggests that female black-headed gulls are constrained in the deposition of antioxidants in last-laid eggs and compensate for this by enhanced testosterone deposition.

Female birds deposit variable amounts of androgens in the yolks of their eggs, and it has been suggested that yolk androgen deposition is an adaptive mechanism preparing offspring for a competitive environment. Breeding pairs of Eastern Bluebirds (Sialia sialis) Linnaeus were stimulated with an intruder presentation while ovarian follicles were developing. Yolk steroid concentrations in eggs laid by stimulated females were then compared with yolk steroid concentrations in eggs laid by control females. Additionally, blood samples taken from a subset of control and stimulated females were analysed for plasma steroid hormone concentrations. We predicted that female bluebirds experiencing a simulated intrusion would experience increased levels of circulating plasma androgens that would be reflected by larger amounts of androgens deposited in their eggs compared with control females. 2. Patterns of steroid concentrations differed between egg yolks and female plasma. In egg yolks, androstenedione was the predominant hormone, followed by testosterone. Yolks contained minimal amounts of both corticosterone and oestradiol. In female plasma, however, corticosterone was the predominant hormone, while sex steroids were found at low levels. 3. Yolk steroid concentrations did not vary with laying order in either the control or the stimulated group, a result expected due to the relatively synchronous nature of incubation behaviour exhibited by Eastern Bluebird females. 4. Yolk androgen concentrations in eggs laid by stimulated females were significantly higher than in those laid by control females, suggesting that females increase yolk androgen deposition in response to aggressive encounters. 5. Females exposed to an intruder presentation contained significantly lower levels of plasma androgens than control females. We suggest that the deposition of androgens in the eggs serves as an adaptive method of regulating circulating androgen levels in the female, preventing potentially disruptive elevations in circulating androgen concentrations during a particularly sensitive period in the reproductive cycle."

In this study, we increased the concentration of androgens in the eggs of barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) within the physiological range of variation and analyzed the effect on nestling growth and begging behavior Egg androgens increased body size and mass of sons but reduced these characters in daughters when compared to two control groups in a repeated-measures analysis of variance of data collected at different ages.

Here we used geometric morphometrics to assess variation in plastron shell shape in 1314 neonatal slider turtles (Trachemys scripta) from 162 clutches of laboratory-incubated eggs from two nesting areas. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated that nesting area has a limited role in describing plastron shape variation among clutches, whereas differences between individual clutches were highly significant, suggesting a prominent clutch effect. The covariation between plastron shape and several possible maternal effect variables (yolk hormone levels and egg dimensions) was assessed for a subset of clutches and found to be negligible. We subsequently employed several recently proposed methods for estimating heritability from shape variables, and generalized a univariate approach to accommodate unequal sample sizes. Univariate estimates of shape heritability based on Procrustes distances yielded large values for both nesting populations (h(2) approximate to 0.86), and multivariate estimates of maximal additive heritability were also large for both nesting populations (h(max)(2) approximate to 0.57). We also estimated the dominant trend in heritable shape change for each nesting population and found that the direction of shape evolution was not the same for the two sites. Therefore, although the magnitude of shape evolution was similar between nesting populations, the manner in which plastron shape is evolving is not. We conclude that the univariate approach for assessing quantitative genetic parameters from geometric morphometric data has limited utility, because it is unable to accurately describe how shape is evolving."

Despite an accumulation of evidence that mothers can sex-specifically modulate investment in offspring in relation to maternal quality, few mechanisms have been proposed as to how this is achieved. We explored a hormonal mechanism for sex-biased maternal investment by measuring and experimentally manipulating baseline levels of the stress hormone corticosterone in laying wild female European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and examining effects on sex ratio and sex-specific offspring phenotype adjustment. Here we show that baseline plasma corticosterone is negatively correlated with energetic body condition in laying starlings, and subsequent experimental elevation of maternal baseline plasma corticosterone increased yolk corticosterone without altering maternal condition or egg quality per se. Hormonal elevation resulted in the following: female-biased hatching sex ratios (caused by elevated male embryonic mortality), lighter male offspring at hatching (which subsequently grew more slowly during postnatal development), and lower cell-mediated immune (phytohemagglutinin) responses in males compared with control-born males; female offspring were unaffected by the manipulation in both years of the study. Elevated maternal corticosterone therefore resulted in a sex-biased adjustment of offspring quality favorable to female offspring via both a sex ratio bias and a modulation of male phenotype at hatching. In birds, deposition of yolk corticosterone may benefit mothers by acting as a bet-hedging strategy in stochastic environments where the correlation between environmental cues at laying (and therefore potentially maternal condition) and conditions during chick-rearing might be low and unpredictable. Together with recent studies in other vertebrate taxa, these results suggest that maternal stress hormones provide a mechanistic link between maternal quality and sex-biased maternal investment in offspring."

Potential costs include an increased susceptibility to parasites in nestlings exposed to high concentrations of yolk androgens during embryonic development, weaker immune response or increased levels of circulating corticosterone that indirectly reduce immune function. 3. In a field study, we manipulated yolk testosterone in great tit (Parus major) eggs and tested the nestling's susceptibility to ectoparasites as measured by the parasites' effect on growth, the cellular immune response, and the levels of circulating corticosterone. 4.

In addition, parents may need to sex bias their investment if there is an asymmetry between the sexes in offspring fitness under different conditions. For studying maternal differential investment, egg resources are ideal subjects because they are self contained and allocated unequivocally by the female. Recent studies show that yolk androgens can be beneficial to offspring, so here we test for sex-biased investment with maternal investment of yolk testosterone ( T) in zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) eggs. From the Trivers - Willard hypothesis, we predicted females to invest more in male eggs in optimum circumstances ( e. g. good-condition mother, early-laid egg), and more in female eggs under suboptimal conditions ( e. g. poor-condition mother, late-laid egg). This latter prediction is also because in this species there is a female nestling disadvantage in poor conditions and we expected mothers to help compensate for this in female eggs. Indeed, we found more yolk T in female than male eggs. Moreover, in accordance with our predictions, yolk T in male eggs increased with maternal quality relative to female eggs, and decreased with laying order relative to female eggs. This supports our predictions for the different needs and value of male and female offspring in zebra finches. Our results support the idea that females may use yolk androgens as a tool to adaptively manipulate the inequalities between different nestlings."

Descriptive and experimental studies show systematic variation in maternal androgen deposition both within and among clutches, as well as in relation to the sex of the embryo. We discuss the potential adaptive value of maternal androgen transfer at all these three levels. We conclude that maternal androgen deposition in avian eggs provides a flexible mechanism of non-genetic inheritance, by which the mother can favour some offspring over others, and adjust their developmental trajectories to prevailing environmental conditions, producing different phenotypes. However, the literature is less consistent than often assumed and at all three levels, the functional explanations need further experimental testing.

In the present study, we show that free-living females of the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis), a small passerine bird, do not produce larger eggs or deposit more testosterone into eggs when mating with attractive males reflected by a large forehead patch size, which is contrary to the prediction of the differential allocation hypothesis. However, we found higher yolk testosterone concentrations in eggs laid for young than older males. Because in young males genetic quality, parental experience, or willingness to invest into paternal care is likely to be low, high yolk testosterone level in their clutches may indicate that their females follow a compensatory tactic. They may elicit more paternal care from young, inexperienced males by hormonally increasing nestling begging. Laying date was also correlated with yolk testosterone level; however, when we controlled for it, male age still remained a strong determinant of testosterone allocation."

The method of sampling is important because hormones are not homogeneously distributed within the egg, and after onset of embryonic development their levels may decrease and increase due to changes in egg structure and secretion or uptake of hormones by the embryo. The extraction of hormones from the yolk and chromatographic separation of different hormones for immunoassays can strongly influence the results because such procedures remove interfering substances such as proteins, lipids, and other hormones and their metabolites, which can cross-react with the antiserum used.

We examined primary resource allocation in zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, when mated to both an attractive and an unattractive male. In the first breeding round, as predicted, females mated to attractive males laid heavier eggs, and there was a positive relation between female mass and egg mass. In contrast, for females mated to unattractive males there was no correlation between egg mass and body mass. Mate attractiveness did not affect clutch size or yolk androgen investment. Unexpectedly, in the second breeding round, in which the same females were paired with different males of opposite attractiveness to those in the first round, females did not alter their individual patterns of investment in egg mass. Therefore, we suggest there may be a physiological carryover effect and that females were primed by their first reproductive experience. In both rounds of breeding there was no difference in egg mass or yolk androgen concentration between male or female eggs in either treatment. Similarly, the primary sex ratio did not differ between treatments.

Increasing deposition of maternal androgens with the laying sequence has been suggested to compensate for detrimental effects of hatching asynchrony, allowing a more precise adjustment of the survival probabilities of each chick. Here, we show for black-headed gulls that the increase in yolk testosterone with each successive egg is greater when the mother incubates longer before clutch completion, which is the major determinant of the degree of hatching asynchrony. This finding supports the idea that yolk testosterone has a compensatory function in the context of hatching asynchrony. Our data further show that if the time needed to complete a clutch is lengthened, the developmental differences due to incubation between the first- and the last-laid eggs increase. In addition, the onset of incubation before clutch completion occurs sooner as the breeding season progresses. Both long inter-egg intervals and the seasonal shift in incubation behavior enhance the necessity of compensation for later-hatching chicks. Indeed, yolk levels of testosterone increased more steeply over the laying order, if the duration of the egg-laying period was extended and in later-laid clutches. We suggest that prolactin plays a key role in the adjustment of testosterone allocation to the incubation pattern."

Hormones that regulate both the reproductive cycle and vitellogenic activity in turtles may provide a novel physiological mechanism for control of egg size. 3. This physiological constraint hypothesis was explored by examining the relationship between maternally derived yolk hormones and egg mass in the Painted Turtle (Chrysemys picta, Schneider). 4. Eggs from younger females contained significantly more testosterone in the yolk than did eggs from older females. Younger females laid eggs nearly 20\% smaller than those of older females even where body sizes overlapped. 5.

Furthermore, experimental elevation of both yolk androstenedione and testosterone increased chick growth and begging in black-headed gulls. We measured daily growth of European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) chicks hatching from testosterone-treated or vehicle-treated (control) eggs until 14 days of age, and measured begging behavior at hatching and at 5 days of age. A temporary drought caused relatively high levels of early brood reduction for this population; 2- and 3-day-old chicks were most likely to starve. We found that chicks from testosterone-treated eggs were less likely to starve than control chicks, and were heavier on the days when most brood reduction occurred. However, chicks from testosterone-treated eggs begged less than control chicks on the day of hatching, and begged similarly at 5 days of age. Thus, while yolk testosterone did increase growth during periods of (presumably) high competition, increased begging does not appear to mediate this effect. Instead, testosterone may induce more efficient energy use, for example, by decreasing ineffective begging.

Here, we report the results of a field experiment in which we manipulated the circulating levels of testosterone in female spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor) before egg formation. Focal females were controlled in subsequent years to explore possible delayed effects of hormone manipulation on primary sex ratio and social status that could persist because of permanent hormonal change or through hormone-dominance interactions. The results indicate that testosterone-implanted females (T-females) produced significantly more sons than control females (C-females) in the year in which they were manipulated. These differences in offspring sex ratio between T- and C-females persisted in the next 3 years, although no additional hormone treatments were given. These results were not mediated by an eventual effect of testosterone treatment on the quality of the females mates. A similar proportion of T- and C-females acquired a nest box and bred either in the manipulation year or in Year I after manipulation, but T-females tended to be more successful in acquiring a nest box than C-females in Years 2 and 3 after manipulation. These results suggest that added testosterone had a direct role on the acquisition and maintenance of high social rank. Delayed effects of testosterone on primary sex ratio might have been caused by altered endogenous production of T-females. Alternatively, the maintenance of sex ratio differences between T- and C-females long after having being implanted might be attributed to the positive effect that enhanced social rank of T-females has on their circulating testosterone levels.

This pattern suggests that yolk androgens are costly to females. In this study, we experimentally manipulated adult female condition in zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata by modifying the level of developmental stress they suffered as nestlings. This was achieved by cross-fostering nestlings to broods of varying brood size. Subsequently, we measured the yolk testosterone contents of the female offspring that resulted from the experimental manipulation. As predicted, females deposited decreasing concentrations of testosterone with increasing brood sizes experienced as nestlings: testosterone concentration (mean +/- S.E.M.) of eggs laid by females from small broods, 20.66 +/- 2.08 pg mg(-1); medium broods, 15.32 +/- 1.94 pg mg(-1); and large broods, 14.51 +/- 1.66 pg mg(-1). Additionally, testosterone concentration decreased with laying order, and varied with clutch size in a complex way. Differences in egg testosterone between females exposed to different brood sizes are in line with previous findings in showing that early developmental stress can affect adult reproductive performance, although our study did not detect an effect in other breeding parameters, such as latency to breed or clutch size.

In part, this is because we lack detailed information about the day-to-day pattern of changes in plasma hormone levels during the laying cycle for non-domesticated birds. Here, we describe changes in plasma estradiol-17beta (E2) and androgens, throughout laying in relation to specific stages of ovarian follicular development in the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris). Plasma E2 levels increased rapidly from the onset of rapid yolk development (RYD) to reach maximum levels in birds with a complete follicle hierarchy ( greater than or equal to 4 yolky follicles). However, levels decreased linearly throughout the later stages of follicle development returning to pre-breeding values before the final yolky follicle was ovulated. In females with greater than or equal to 4 yolky follicles there was 10-fold variation in plasma E2 levels among individual females, but this was not related to plasma levels of the main yolk precursor vitellogenin or to the total mass of yolky follicles developing at the time of blood sampling. In contrast to E2, plasma androgen levels showed only a very gradual linear decline throughout the laying cycle from pre-RYD to clutch completion. Furthermore, androgen levels showed less individual variability: 4-fold variation among females with greater than or equal to 4 yolky follicles, although this was also independent of our measures of reproductive function. Data on inter- and intra-individual variation in female hormone levels are important to set-up a priori predictions for, and interpretation of, studies of yolk hormone levels. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The concentration and total content of yolk androstenedione and yolk testosterone were measured in eggs from 24 clutches distributed across nine different colonies of nestboxes. 3.

These hormones can have profound influences in the development of the embryo and the nestling, and even shape the phenotype of the adult bird. In this review I evaluate the research that has been developed in the last ten years in this field, and I suggest several lines of research that might be worth following in the future. Evidence shows that high levels of androgens in eggs speed up embryonic development, boost muscular growth and begging rates in nestlings. A study in captivity with canaries Serinus domesticus has identified an influence of egg androgen in the social hierarchy of the adult bird. Research is needed to ascertain long-term effects of egg androgens in the wild, but the picture is a promising one. Several studies have found a positive correlation between female hormone levels and those of the egg. However, it is still not clear whether this is the re! sult of passive transfer or, on the contrary, there are mechanisms that control the transfer of hormones from the mother to the egg. Whatever the mechanism, several experiments show that females lay eggs with higher concentrations of androgens when paired to attractive mates. This pattern of differential allocation suggests that egg androgens are a costly resource, and that there are limiting factors for the mother or the offspring. Research has uncovered several other interesting patterns, such as differences between male and female bearing eggs in androgen levels, or a positive covariance with breeding density in different colonies of the same species. Another exciting issue concerns the uneven distribution of egg androgen within the same clutch. It has been suggested that females could use this mechanism to control aggression and competition among nestlings. To summarise, egg androgen allocation constitutes a powerful mechanism which females could use to modify offspring ph! enotype. Large between-species differences in egg androgen concentrations suggest that a comparative analysis may be the best tool to understand the role of the many ecological and evolutionary factors that may have shaped the evolution of this character."

Here, we experimentally investigated whether socially stressful conditions experienced by female house sparrows during egg laying affected their circulating levels of androgens and the amount transferred to the eggs. Social stress was simulated by the intrusion of a foreign male placed near the nest box during the egg-laying sequence. We found that (1) both female and yolk testosterone titres were positively related to breeding density; (2) yolk testosterone was negatively correlated with maternal testosterone; (3) yolk testosterone was positively correlated with the behavioural response of females towards the intruder and (4) the interaction between social intrusion and breeding density affected the amount of testosterone transferred to the eggs.

We experimentally enhanced maternal condition by supplementary feeding lesser black-backed gulls (Larus fuscus) during egg formation and compared the concentrations of androstenedione (A4), 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and testosterone (T) in their eggs with those in eggs laid by control females. We also measured circulating levels of T in females immediately after laying. Egg androgens could affect offspring performance directly through chick development and/or indirectly through changes in the competitive ability of a chick relative to its siblings. To avoid confounding these two routes, and to separate effects operating through the egg itself with those operating through experimental changes in parental chick rearing capacity, we fostered eggs from both maternal treatment groups singly into the nests of unmanipulated parents. Contrary to expectation, mothers with experimentally enhanced body condition laid eggs with lower levels of androgens, while exhibiting higher circulating T concentrations post-laying. Despite these lower levels of egg androgen, offspring hatched from eggs laid by mothers in good condition did not show reduced growth or survival when reared in the absence of sibling competition.

However, not all females show the same increase in yolk hormones from first to last egg or invest equally high amounts of androgens in their clutches. Possibly, there is a trade-off between the beneficial effects of high androgen levels and potential costs, such as increased metabolic rates. We studied possible metabolic costs of experimentally elevated yolk androgen levels for chicks of several age classes, starting three days prior to hatching until fledging at an age of approximately 30 days. Daily energy expenditure in the field, measured using the doubly labelled water technique, did not differ between treatments or between sexes. Oxygen consumption measured in birds at rest in the lab (RMR) did not vary between chicks hatched from androgen-injected (T) or oil-injected (Oil) control eggs at any age in thermo-neutral or below thermo-neutral conditions.

For sex determination the eggs have to be incubated to allow the germinal disc to grow and thus extract sufficient DNA. This means that yolk hormone levels are determined after a number of days of incubation and this may hamper interpretation of the data. If yolk utilization or embryonic hormone production are influenced by the sex of the embryo, differences in hormone content at a certain stage of incubation do not reflect the mother's initial allocation. In this experiment we show that testosterone levels in chicken eggs do not change with incubation period. A4 levels decrease between 3 and 5 days of incubation, which we cannot explain.

This hypothesis predicts that females of high quality or high reproductive potential should invest more yolk androgens in their eggs than females of low quality or low reproductive potential. We tested these predictions by examining interfemale variation in allocation of the androgenic steroids testosterone and androstenedione to eggs in a wild population of European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris. We collected 30 full clutches of eggs and captured 22 of the females that laid these clutches for phenotypic measurements. In agreement with the hypothesis, we found that there was significant interfemale variation in yolk androgen concentrations. Furthermore, older females deposited more androstenedione and testosterone in eggs than 1-year-old females, and females laying early or large clutches deposited more testosterone in eggs than females laying late or small clutches. However, females in good body condition did not deposit more androgens in eggs than females in poor body condition. Large-yolked eggs had a higher total yolk androgen content than small-yolked eggs, but larger eggs did not have higher concentrations of yolk androgens. The results in general support the investment hypothesis of yolk androgen allocation.

We found that sex-specific differences in the yolk hormones strongly depend on the social rank of the mother. First, dominant females, but not subdominant females, allocated significantly more testosterone to male eggs than to female eggs. Second, subordinate females increased the testosterone concentrations of female eggs. This pattern of yolk hormone deposition can be functionally explained. In polygynous species such as the chicken, reproductive success is more variable in males than in females. Parental investment in sons or daughters is therefore expected to occur in direct relation to parental rearing capacities. We found that the social status of a hen was indeed negatively correlated with her maternal capacities (for example, body mass, egg mass). Differential androgen deposition might thus provide a mechanism for adaptive maternal investment depending on both the sex of the egg and the social status of the mother."

In addition, some effects of progesterone treatment differed between male and female fetuses, suggesting that this buffering may differ between the sexes. In a second experiment, we examined the relationship between maternal and fetal hormone levels in viviparous versus oviparous species. We measured endogenous progesterone, testosterone, estradiol, and corticosterone levels in pregnant S. jarrovi and their fetuses and neonates, and in gravid S. graciosus (an oviparous congener) and their fetuses and hatchlings.

Androgen levels increased strongly with laying order, irrespective of egg or yolk mass. This may compensate for the disadvantages of the later hatching chicks. These results have implications for adaptive hypotheses that were proposed for asynchronous incubation. 4. Eggs of lighter clutches contained more androgens, perhaps to compensate for a lower nutritional quality of these eggs. 5. Birds breeding in the periphery of a colony, being relatively more aggressive and having relatively large territories, laid eggs that contained more androgens than those of birds breeding in the centre. These high yolk androgen levels may facilitate growth and motor development of the chicks, which may be especially important for chicks developing at the periphery of a colony. Reduced levels may be adaptive for birds breeding in the centre, where risk of infectious diseases is high, since steroids may be immunosuppressive. 6. Corrected for nest distance, clutches of birds in high vegetation, where predation risk is less severe and therefore competition for nest sites perhaps high, contained relatively high levels of androgens.

We documented plasma and yolk T concentrations in adult females, in their developing follicles and eggs, and in freshly oviposited and incubating eggs. Plasma T was higher in reproductively active than in reproductively inactive females. Within reproductively active females, those with a single, large yolking follicle had higher plasma T than those that had one or more shelling, oviductal eggs. Individual females contributed different amounts of T to their yolks, but within females, more mature follicles or eggs consistently had higher yolk T concentrations than did less mature follicles or eggs. Similar to previous research, yolk T concentrations at oviposition were higher in male eggs than in female eggs. However, T levels during incubation did not differ by embryo sex, but rather increased in both male and female eggs. These results suggest that T plays a role in the reproductive physiology of females and potentially in the phenotypic development of their offspring. Furthermore, whereas the yolk T increase observed during follicular maturation is clearly a maternal influence, it remains unclear whether that observed during egg development (i.e., postfertilization) results from a lack of T uptake by the embryo as yolk is absorbed, from embryonic production of T that diffuses into the yolk, or from some combination of these processes.

We characterized all three levels of variation in maternally derived androgens (testosterone and androstenedione) present in yolks of American coot eggs. We found no variation in testosterone levels within eggs which suggests that embryos are exposed to constant androgen levels during development. and that field-based yolk biopsies are an appropriate way to sample eggs for this species.

American coots lay large clutches, and unequal resource allocation among offspring may be the optimal strategy for females with access to limited resources. Most of the variation in androgen levels occurred among eggs from different females.

To investigate the effects of these yolk androgens on nestling `fitness', we injected both T and A(4) into the yolks of first-laid eggs and compared their hatching time, nestling growth and nestling survival with those of first laid eggs in which we injected vehicle as a control.

The adverse actions of yolk androgen treatment in the kestrel are in contrast to the favourable actions of yolk T treatment found previously in canaries (Serinus canaria).

Levels of the stress hormone, cortisol, in females are elevated by social interactions and transferred directly to the yolk of eggs, where they may influence developmental rates. In some vertebrates, prenatal exposure to high levels of testosterone determine early growth rates, social status and reproductive success. The present study examined whether post-fertilization exposure of eggs of the tropical damsel fish, Pomacentrus amboinensis (Pomacentridae), to natural levels of cortisol or testosterone directly affects larval morphology at hatching. Maternal and egg levels of cortisol and testosterone varied widely among clutches of eggs from local populations around Lizard Island on the Great Barrier Reef. The morphology of larvae produced by these local fish populations also varied widely and differed significantly among sites (e.g., standard length: 2.6-3.4 mm; yolk sac area: 0.01-0.13 x 10(-2) mm(2)). Laboratory experiments showed that elevated cortisol levels in the egg reduced larval length at hatching, while slight elevations in testosterone increased yolk sac size. The influence of testosterone, acid to a smaller extent cortisol, on larval morphology differed among egg clutches. These differences were partly explained by differences in initial egg hormone levels. Morphological changes induced by experimental hormonal regimes encompassed the entire range of variability in body attributes found in field populations. Tt is unclear whether cortisol influences growth alone or development rate or both. Testosterone appears to influence yolk utilization rates, and has no significant effect on growth, in contrast to its role in later developmental stages. Maternally derived cortisol and testosterone are important in regulating growth, development, and nutritive reserves of the embryo and larvae of this fish species. Factors that influence the maternal levels of cortisol and testosterone may have 3 major impact on laval mortality schedules and, therefore, on which breeding individuals contribute to the next generation."

However, most knowledge comes from captive animals or long-lived slow growing species. Moreover, little is known about how innate immune function, the important first line of defence, develops during early life in fast-growing animals such as free-living passerines. We studied development of innate baseline immune function in nestlings of free-living jackdaws Corvus monedula. We measured four immune parameters (hemolysis, hemagglutination, bacterial-killing capacity, haptoglobin concentration) and structural body size (body mass, wing length, tarsus length) at day 12 and day 29 post-hatching. We found that three out of four immune parameters (hemolysis, hemagglutination, bacterial-killing capacity) substantially increased with nestling age and had roughly reached adult levels shortly prior to fledging. We found little differences in immune development between males and females despite them differing in structural development. We also found no evidence that the nestlings traded off immune development with growth. That nestlings rapidly increase innate baseline immune function during early life and similarly in males and females indicates the importance of a well-functioning immune system already during the nestling phase.  2020 The Author(s)"

One such behaviour we observed was siblicide, the death of one chick from falling out of the nest as a consequence of agonistic harassment by the other (Dickins et al., 1985). This harassment involved what we termed siblicidal pecks inflicted by the dominant chick on its younger sib, not in the context of feeding. These we distinguished observationally from punishing pecks, also made by the dominant chick on its brood mate, specifically when the latter was begging for food from a parent, causing it to stop this behaviour in the short term. Though the evolution of siblicide initially seemed to present a paradox for Inclusive fitness theory it was soon seen to be a logical corollary thereof (O'Connor, 1978) (D. Mock & Parker, 1998), and dependent upon key ecological variables. A number of subsequent studies of these factors in the kittiwake, largely from the ecological and ornithological literature, are here collated, and it is considered how these might be integrated with the application of concepts from operant psychology to chick and parent behaviours (Reed, 2015), to give a full account.  2020 Elsevier Inc."

In this study, we tested if maternal stress affects measures of stress and fear in five strains of layer breeders: commercial brown 1 & 2, commercial white 1 & 2 and a pure line White Leghorn. Each strain was equally separated into two groups: Maternal Stress (MS), where hens were subjected to a series of 8 consecutive days of acute psychological stressors, and Control, which received routine husbandry. Additional eggs from Control were injected either with corticosterone diluted in a vehicle solution (CORT) or just Vehicle. Stress- and fear-responses of the offspring were measured in a plasma corticosterone test and a combined human approach and novel object test. While the stress treatments did not affect the measured endpoints in the offspring, significant strain differences were found. The offspring of the white strains showed a higher physiological response compared to brown strains and the White 2 offspring was the least fearful strain in the human approach test. Our study found that neither the acute psychological stressors experienced by layer breeders nor the egg injections of corticosterone affected the parameters tested in their offspring. Post hoc power analyses suggest that the lack of treatment effects might be due to a small sample size (type II error). Although studies on larger flocks of layers are still needed, our results provide an initial understanding of an important subject, as in poultry production, layer breeders are often subjected to short-term stressors. In addition, our results suggest the dissociation between the physiological and behavioural parameters of stress response in laying hens, showing that increased concentrations of plasma corticosterone in response to stress might not be directly associated with high levels of fear.  2020 Elsevier Inc."

Theory posits that parents interpretation and response to begging should vary with the likelihood of a return on their investment. We tested this in a wild population of prothonotary warblers (Protonotaria citrea), predicting that parents bias food non-randomly toward certain individuals within their broods depending on both the size and number of offspring. We observed parentoffspring interactions and detected strong dependence between brood size and nestling size in shaping parental responses to begging. Larger siblings were less likely to solicit food during feeding events than their smaller siblings, but they received a disproportionate share from parents in nests containing fewer-than-average young, whereas the smaller-than-average nestlings were disproportionately fed in broods containing a greater-than-average number of young. These findings suggest that parents respond to begging signals according to multiple social cues, favoring the stronger siblings with greater survival prospects when few copies of their genes are present, but overtly favoring runts to ensure whole-brood survival when capable of fledging more young. Future experimental studies may shed light on the contributions of parental decision-making and memory, how young nestlings learn in parentoffspring communication systems, and the adaptive significance of these behaviors.  2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature."

Endothermy is acquired and regulated via various endocrine and molecular pathways, and ultimately allows wide aerial, aquatic, and terrestrial distribution in variable environments. However, due to our changing climate, birds are faced with potential new challenges for thermoregulation, such as more frequent extreme weather events, lower predictability of climate, and increasing mean temperature. We provide an overview on thermoregulation in birds and its endocrine and molecular mechanisms, pinpointing gaps in current knowledge and recent developments, focusing especially on non-model species to understand the generality of, and variation in, mechanisms. We highlight plasticity of thermoregulation and underlying endocrine regulation, because thorough understanding of plasticity is key to predicting responses to changing environmental conditions. To this end, we discuss how changing climate is likely to affect avian thermoregulation and associated endocrine traits, and how the interplay between these physiological processes may play a role in facilitating or constraining adaptation to a changing climate. We conclude that while the general patterns of endocrine regulation of thermogenesis are quite well understood, at least in poultry, the molecular and endocrine mechanisms that regulate, e.g. mitochondrial function and plasticity of thermoregulation over different time scales (from transgenerational to daily variation), need to be unveiled. Plasticity may ameliorate climate change effects on thermoregulation to some extent, but the increased frequency of extreme weather events, and associated changes in resource availability, may be beyond the scope and/or speed for plastic responses. This could lead to selection for more tolerant phenotypes, if the underlying physiological traits harbour genetic and individual variation for selection to act on  a key question for future research.  2020 The Author(s)"

We found that cellular constitutive immunity could be affected by age, sex, brood size, or daily rhythm. Early-stage nestlings relied more on cells of the innate immunity rather than on cells linked to the adaptive immune system. Cellular immunity may not be fully mature in fledglings, as reflected by differences in phagocytic cell counts with regard to adults. Beyond the age-dependent effects, agranulocyte cell counts were affected by sibling competition while granulocyte cell counts showed a daily rhythm.

Here, we review the relationship between immunity, stress, spawning, and sex hormones in fish to gain a better understanding of sex-based differences in fish immune responses and its consequences for aquaculture. It is well known that there is a strong link between the stress response and immune function in fish. In addition, research to date has demonstrated that sexual dimorphism in the stress response exists in many species; yet, the relationship between the sexual dimorphic stress responses and immune function has rarely been explored together. Aside from stress, spawning is also known to trigger changes in fish immune responses. Estrogens and androgens have been shown to modulate the immune system which could account for differences between the two sexes of fish when spawning; however, evidence regarding the sexual dimorphism of these changes varies between fishes and is likely related to the spawning strategy employed by a given species. Sex hormones are also used in aquaculture practices to produce monosex populations, and exposure to these hormones early in development has been shown to impact the development of immune organs in several fishes. While female fish are generally thought to be more robust than males, aquaculture practices should also consider the role that maternal stress has on the immune function of the offspring and what role this plays in compromising the immune response of farmed fish.  2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature."

However, chronic exposure to high concentrations of glucocorticoids can lead to metabolic dysregulation, impaired immune function, and cognitive decline. In developing young, this hormonal stress response shows considerable variation. Generally, the physiological stress response of young of precocial species is comparable to that of adults, whereas offspring of altricial species exhibit an attenuated response compared to adults. The developmental hypothesis of the HPA axis proposes that the dampened stress response in dependent offspring is an adaptive response to avoid the negative effects of elevated glucocorticoids, particularly in altricial species where young lack the ability to mitigate stressful stimuli. We aimed to test the developmental hypothesis in a tropical avian species, the lance-tailed manakin (Chiroxiphia lanceolata). We predicted that nestlings of this altricial species should have a dampened corticosterone response, in both magnitude and duration, compared to that of adults. We also predicted that recently fledged hatch-year birds would display a response intermediate to that of adults and nestlings. We quantified circulating corticosterone levels in adults, recently fledged hatch-year birds, and 11-day-old nestlings using a standardized capture and restraint protocol. Nestlings showed a lower maximal corticosterone response and faster negative feedback compared to adults. Further, five post-fledging hatch-year birds showed a feedback response intermediate to those of nestlings and adults. However, we caution against generalizing about fledgling responses beyond this study due to the small sample (n = 5). Interestingly, lance-tailed manakin nestlings appear to return to baseline concentrations faster than nestlings of temperate species. These results support the developmental hypothesis of the HPA axis explaining variation in stress response. This study is the first to assess the development of the hormonal stress response in nestlings of a tropical bird, which is of interest because of our still-developing understanding of how tropical and temperate species differ physiologically. Finally, findings here underscore the importance of validating and adjusting sampling protocols that quantify nestling stress responses, as sampling timelines identified for adults may underestimate the magnitude of the nestling stress response.  2020 Elsevier Inc."

In this study, we synthesized insights derived from empirical studies on social networks and parasites using a meta-analytical approach. We analysed 210 associations between parasite burden and individual level network metrics extracted from 18 published articles. Overall, we found a positive effect of social behaviour, measured by social network metrics, on parasite infection at the individual level, with no evidence of publication bias. The magnitude of the mean effect size for associations between social network metrics and measures of parasitism was nearly twice as large as that observed for group size in previous meta-analyses. However, there was significant heterogeneity in effect sizes across studies, and this pattern could not be explained by either host traits, parasite traits or the social network metric examined. We discuss potential reasons for this unexplained heterogeneity, such as possible mismatches between focal host social behaviour and focal parasite biology as well as methodological considerations.

Because circulating GC levels increase in response to challenges, within-population variation in GCs could reflect among-individual variation in condition or experience. At the same time, individual variation in GC regulation could have causal effects on energetic balance or stress coping capacity in ways that influence fitness. Although a number of studies in vertebrates have tested whether variation in GCs among individuals predicts components of fitness, it is not clear whether there are consistent patterns across taxa. Here we present the first phylogenetic meta-analysis testing whether variation in GCs is associated with survival and reproductive success across vertebrates. At the same time, we introduce and test predictions about a potentially important mediator of GC-fitness relationships: life history context. We suggest that strong context-dependence in the fitness benefit of maintaining elevated GCs could obscure consistent patterns between GCs and fitness across taxa. Meta-analyses revealed that baseline and stress-induced GCs were consistently negatively correlated with reproductive success. This relationship did not differ depending on life history context. In contrast, the relationships between GCs and survival were highly context dependent, differing according to life history strategy. Both baseline and stress-induced GCs were more strongly negatively associated with survival in longer-lived populations and species. Stress-induced GCs were also more positively associated with survival in organisms that engage in relatively more valuable reproductive attempts. Fecal GCs did not correlate with survival or reproductive success. We also found that experimental increases in GCs reduced both survival and reproductive success; however, evidence of publication bias and the small sample size suggest that more data is required to confirm this conclusion. Overall, these results support the prediction that GC-fitness relationships can be strongly context dependent, and suggest that incorporating life history may be particularly important for understanding GC-survival relationships.  2020 Elsevier Inc."

Multivariate effects on offspring phenotype were evaluated in a study on captive zebra finches, by simultaneously manipulating maternally derived antibodies (MAb) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment of mothers and injection of testosterone into the egg yolk. LPS treatment had a positive effect on body mass growth at 30days after hatching and immune response at sexual maturity, while egg testosterone treatment positively influenced immune response at fledging and courtship behaviour in sexually mature male offspring. Maternal effects are known to modulate offspring telomere length (TL). However, the multivariate effects of egg-derived maternal components on offspring telomere dynamics from hatching to sexual maturity are undefined. Here, we tested: (1) the effects of LPS and testosterone treatments on TL from hatching to sexual maturity (day 82); (2) how LPS treatment modulated TL over reproduction in adult females; and (3) the relationship between maternal and offspring TL. We predicted that TL would be shorter in LPS fledglings (as a cost of faster growth) and that TL would be longer in sexually mature adults after yolk testosterone treatment (as a proxy of individual quality). In adult females, there was an overall negative relationship between laying and rearing investments and TL, this relationship was weaker in LPS-treated females. In chicks, there was an overall negative effect of LPS treatment on TL measured at fledging and sexual maturity (day 25-82). In addition, at fledging, there was a SexLPSTestosterone interaction, suggesting the existence of antagonistic effects of our treatments.

The offspring of these birds and control parents were cross fostered at hatching to enlarge or reduce its brood size. Independent of parents early-life OS levels, the chicks raised in enlarged broods showed lower erythrocyte glutathione levels, revealing glutathione sensitivity to environmental conditions. Control biological mothers produced females, not males, that attained a higher body mass when raised in a benign environment (i.e., the reduced brood). In contrast, biological mothers exposed to early-life OS produced heavier males, not females, when allocated in reduced broods. Early-life OS also affected the parental rearing capacity because 12-day-old nestlings raised by a foster pair with both early-high-OS members grew shorter legs (tarsus) than chicks from other groups. The results indicate that environmental conditions during development can affect early glutathione levels, which may in turn influence the next generation through both pre-and postnatal parental effects. The results also demonstrate that earlylife OS can constrain the offspring phenotype.  2020 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved."

We experimentally exposed a parental generation of Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica) to GBHs (200 mg/kg feed) or respective controls. Glyphosate residues were found in eggs (ca 0.76 kg/mg). Embryonic development tended to be poorer in the eggs of GBH-exposed parents (76% of eggs showed normal development) compared to control parents (89% normal eggs). Embryonic brain tissue from GBH-exposed parents tended to express more lipid damage (20% higher), yet other biomarkers showed no apparent differences. We detected no differences in egg quality (egg, yolk, or shell mass, egg hormone concentration) across the treatment groups. Given this is the first long-term study testing parental effects of GBHs with birds, more studies are needed characterizing GBH-associated changes in maternal allocation and for example epigenetic programming.  2020, The Author(s)."

Yet context-dependent effects have rarely been experimentally tested. We therefore studied whether maternally transferred thyroid hormones (THs) exert context-dependent effects on offspring survival and physiology by manipulating both egg TH levels and post-hatching nest temperature in wild pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) using a full factorial design. We found no clear evidence for context-dependent effects of prenatal THs related to postnatal temperature on growth, survival and potential underlying physiological responses (plasma TH levels, oxidative stress and mitochondrial density). We conclude that future studies should test for other key environmental conditions, such as food availability, to understand potential context-dependent effects of maternally transmitted hormones on offspring, and their role in adapting to changing environments.  2020, The Author(s)."

We also evaluated whether the experienced situations by adults can affect the immune response of their undisturbed offspring. In the parental generation, supplemented quail exposed to CHS had a higher inflammatory response and similar values of the heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio than those that were not supplemented. In their offspring, those chicks whose parents were exposed to CHS showed higher inflammatory response and lower antibody production. Regarding the H/L ratio, chicks whose parents were supplemented showed lower H/L ratio values. Dietary supplementation with thymol partially and positively modulated the inflammatory response and avoided H/L ratio alteration in the parental generation exposed to high environmental temperatures, suggesting these adults were better at dealing with the challenge. The lower H/L ratio values in the offspring suggests that chicks are more capable to deal with potential stressful situations associated with conventional breeding conditions.  2020, The Author(s)."

Maternal mediated effects have significant potential in the chicken meat industry, as breeder hens are feed restricted in a bid to improve performance. Evidence suggests breeder hens are chronically stressed, resulting from periods of prolonged hunger. However, evidence linking embryonic exposure to early-life stress and altered offspring phenotype in meat chickens is lacking. Additionally, methods to alleviate the phenotypic consequences of early-life stress have not been comprehensively explored. Nutritional supplementation with amino acids, such as arginine (Arg), may provide one such option, as Arg reportedly enhances performance characteristics in chicken meat birds. Aims: An in ovo study was conducted to investigate whether exposure to in ovo stress altered offspring performance in meat chickens. Additionally, Arg was supplemented post-hatch to alleviate reductions in performance, hypothesised to occur as a result of exposure to corticosterone. Method: A total of 400 eggs were divided into two groups and administered a corticosterone (CORT) or control (CON) solution at embryonic Day 11. At hatch, birds were separated into four groups based on in ovo and dietary treatments: CORT-Control, CORT-Arg, CON-Arg and CON-Control. Birds fed supplementary Arg diets received an Arg: lysine inclusion of 125%. Bodyweight (bwt) and feed conversion were recorded weekly. Birds were euthanised at embryonic Day 15, Day 0, 7, 21 (n = 40 birds/time point), 28 and 35 (n = 48 birds/time point) for organ collection. A total of 12 additional female birds were euthanised and subjected to a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan for body composition at Day 35. Results: Neither in ovo nor diet treatments influenced bwt, bwt gain, feed conversion or plasma corticosterone at any time point, nor did any in ovo by diet interaction exist. Female birds exposed to CORT exhibited significantly greater fat mass (%bwt P = 0.007) and reduced lean mass (%bwt P = 0.026) compared with CON females at Day 35. Supplementary Arg did not influence bird body composition. Conclusions: These findings suggest in ovo exposure to CORT may negatively influence body composition of female birds. Implications: Understanding the effects of the maternal/in ovo environment may provide a novel approach to further improve carcass quality and flock uniformity.  2021 CSIRO."

In vertebrates, predation risk activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and there is growing evidence that activation of the maternal HPA axis can have intergenerational consequences via, for example, maternally-derived steroids in eggs. Here, we investigated how predation risk affects a suite of maternally-derived steroids in threespine stickleback eggs across nine Alaskan lakes that vary in whether predatory trout are absent, native, or have been stocked within the last 25 years. Using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS), we detected 20 steroids within unfertilized eggs. Factor analysis suggests that steroids covary within and across steroid classes (i.e. glucocorticoids, progestogens, sex steroids), emphasizing the modularity and interconnectedness of the endocrine response. Surprisingly, egg steroid profiles were not significantly associated with predator regime, although they were more variable when predators were absent compared to when predators were present, with either native or stocked trout. Despite being the most abundant steroid, cortisol was not consistently associated with predation regime. Thus, while predators can affect steroids in adults, including mothers, the link between maternal stress and embryonic development is more complex than a simple one-to-one relationship between the population-level predation risk experienced by mothers and the steroids mothers transfer to their eggs.  2020, The Author(s)."

Hematological parameters such as white blood-cell counts have emerged as a valuable tool to understand this variation by assessing the immunological status of individuals. These tools have long revealed that vertebrate cellular immune systems are highly plastic and respond to injury and infection. However, cellular immune systems may also be able to anticipate a high risk of injury from environmental cues (e.g., predation-related cues) and respond plastically ahead of time. We studied white blood-cell (leukocyte) profiles in African cichlids Pelvicachromis taeniatus that were raised for 4years under different levels of perceived predation risk. In a split-clutch design, we raised fish from hatching onwards under chronic exposure to either conspecific alarm cues (communicating high predation risk) or a distilled water control treatment. Differential blood analysis revealed that alarm cue-exposed fish had twice as many lymphocytes in peripheral blood as did controls, a condition called lymphocytosis. The presence of a higher number of lymphocytes makes the cellular immune response more potent, which accelerates the removal of invading foreign antigens from the bloodstream, and, therefore, may be putatively beneficial in the face of injury. This observed lymphocytosis after long-term exposure to conspecific alarm cues constitutes first evidence for an anticipatory and adaptive plastic response of the cellular immune system to future immunological challenges.  2020, The Author(s)."

However, limited work has examined contributions of both factors across sequential ontogenetic stages for larvae of wild origin. Using a wild population of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) from Black Lake, Michigan (USA), fertilized eggs were collected from stream substrate just prior to hatch at one-meter intervals along seven transect lines at an adult-selected spawning area. Microhabitat variables (depth, discharge, substrate size) were recorded at egg collection points. Body length, body area, and yolk-sac area were quantified for yolk-sac larvae (N= 359) at the time of hatch. Following the onset of exogenous feeding, larval growth was measured weekly for four weeks. Parentage was assigned using genetic-based analysis. Inter-individual variation in phenotypic traits quantified at hatch were attributed to stream microhabitat variables; mean depth had the largest influence. No additive genetic effects were detected at hatch. Post-emergence larval growth significantly varied within and among half-sibling groups with the greatest range in body size observed at 33days post-hatch. Additive genetic variance and heritability increased with age. Results demonstrate that female-selected incubation habitats influenced traits at hatch for wild-origin fish, but effects do not persist to a sequential ontogenetic stage. Alternatively, growth after the onset of exogenous feeding was largely influenced by intrinsic (genetic) factors which must be considered when designing and implementing rehabilitation strategies for lake sturgeon and potentially other threatened riverine fishes.  2020, Springer Nature B.V."

The exposure of embryos to a set of sex hormones and the mutual relations between those hormones cause the emergence of individual morphological and/or behavioural characteristics as well as differences between sexes. We have thus hypothesised that differences in one of these morphological traitsdigit ratiomay be a proxy representing a tendency towards tail autotomy. The aim of this study is to investigate the digit ratio (2D:3D, 2D:4D, 3D:4D) of the sand lizard, Lacerta agilis, Lacertidae, a species characterised by well-developed sexual dimorphism, whereby females are larger than males. We also tested associations between patterns in digit ratio and caudal autotomy, a common defensive mechanism among lizards. To our knowledge, the relationship between a tendency towards autotomy and digit ratio pattern has never been researched. To date, studies on autotomy have mainly focused on the consequences, costs or evolutionary background of tail loss. Hence, researchers examined mostly the frequency of autotomy in the context of predatory pressure or habitat conditions, omitting an individual's behavioural tendency to shed its tail. However, behavioural traits can affect an individual's exposure to predator attack and consequently the need to use an anti-predator strategy. Thus, following this logic, dropping the tail may be the result of the lizard's intraspecific personality characteristics, resulting from the effect of hormones on behaviour or innate traits. Therefore, we suggest that the inclusion of autotomy as a factor explaining observed digit ratio patterns and their variability between taxa has great potential. We used computerised measurements of photographed limbs to determine the length of digits. We found that the digit ratios for all four limbs were significantly lower in females than in males, excluding the 3D:4D ratio for the right hindlimbs. Therefore, the results confirmed the pattern already observed for most lizards. The novel element in our study is the detection of the relationship between a tendency towards caudal autotomy and digit ratio. Individuals with a tendency towards autotomy have a higher 2D:4D ratio in the right forelimbs and a lower 2D:3D ratio in the right hindlimbs. Obtained results suggest that these morphological characteristics are most likely related to intraspecific differences (between bold and shy individuals) which consequently may determine an individual's reaction or susceptibility to be a prey and escape behaviour. Thus, our results are probably the first attempt to link digit ratio to the susceptibility of lizards to tail autotomy.  2020 Anatomical Society"

This pleiotropy, sex dependency and persistency may be the consequence of developmental programming of basic systemic processes such as adrenocortical activity or metabolic rate. We investigated whether experimentally increased in ovo exposure to testosterone influenced hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal function, i.e. baseline and stress-induced corticosterone secretion, and resting metabolic rate (RMR) of adult male and female house sparrows (Passer domesticus). In previous experiments with this passerine bird we demonstrated effects of embryonic testosterone exposure on adult agonistic and sexual behavior and survival. Here we report that baseline corticosterone levels and the stress secretion profile of corticosterone are modified by in ovo testosterone in a sex-specific and life history stage-dependent manner. Compared with controls, males from testosterone-treated eggs had higher baseline corticosterone levels, whereas females from testosterone-treated eggs showed prolonged stress-induced corticosterone secretion during the reproductive but not the non-reproductive phase. Adult RMR was unaffected by in ovo testosterone treatment but correlated with integrated corticosterone stress secretion levels. We conclude that exposure of the embryo to testosterone programs the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in a sex-specific manner that in females depends, in expression, on reproductive state. The modified baseline corticosterone levels in males and stress-induced corticosterone levels in females may explain some of the long-lasting effects of maternal testosterone in the egg on behavior and could be linked to previously observed reduced mortality of testosterone-treated females.  2020.

To flexibly influence offspring, mothers should be able to transmit the hormonal signals independent of their own hormonal status. However, the ability to regulate hormone transfer to the next generation is under debate. We studied the transfer of thyroid hormones (THs) to eggs in a bird model. We elevated thyroxine (T4, the prohormone for the biologically active triiodothyronine, T3) during egg laying using T4 implants in females of a wild population of pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca), and measured the resulting plasma and yolk T4 and T3 levels. We found an increase in plasma and yolk T4 and no change in plasma or yolk T3 concentration, leading to a decrease in yolk T3/T4 ratio in response to the T4 treatment. The yolk T3/T4 ratio was similar to the plasma ratio in females during the yolking phase. This suggests that mothers are not able to regulate TH transfer to yolk but may regulate the T4 to T3 conversion to avoid potential costs of elevated exposure to the active hormone to herself and to her progeny. The absence of regulation in hormone transfer to eggs is in contrast to our predictions. Future studies on deiodinase activity that converts T4 to T3 in maternal and embryonic tissues may help our understanding of how mothers regulate circulating THs during breeding, as well as the embryos' role in converting maternal T4 to its biologically active T3 form during development.  2020.

However, sources of variation in hormone transfer are poorly understood in fish, and thus the first step is to characterise whether environmental challenges alter transfer of maternal hormones to eggs. To this end, we explored the population variation and environmental variation (in response to temperature and endocrine disrupting copper) in maternal thyroid hormone (TH), transfer to offspring in a common fish model species, the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) using multiple approaches: (i) We compared ovarian TH levels among six populations across a wide geographical range in the Baltic Sea, including two populations at high water temperature areas (discharge water areas of nuclear power plants) and we experimentally exposed fish to (ii) environmentally relevant heat stress and (iii) copper for 7 days. We found that populations did not differ in intraovarian TH levels, and short-term heat stress did not influence intraovarian TH levels.

Viviparous species might be more susceptible to increasing temperatures because of their inability to meet their energetic demands following rapid environmental changes. Nevertheless, we do not yet fully understand how lizards with different reproductive modes can respond to climate change. We investigated the effect of both maternal thermal environment during pregnancy and incubation temperature on hatchling morphology and physiological performance of two populations of the lizard Saiphos equalis differing in their mode of reproduction, to test whether reproductive mode affects the ability to buffer against rising temperatures. Gravid females from both populations were subjected to current or projected end-of-century (future) thermal environments, to evaluate differences in the body size, growth rate, thermal preference, and locomotor performance of their offspring. Our results show that independently of the mode of reproduction, high temperatures accelerated gestation periods. Thermal environments did not affect hatchling thermal preference, but viviparous hatchlings consistently preferred lower temperatures. Unlike viviparous lizards, oviparous hatchlings incubated under future temperatures were smaller and had a lower growth rate compared to current-incubated hatchlings. Finally, thermal environments did not affect hatchling endurance and speed when controlling for body size. Our results show that global warming is likely to have a negative impact on S. equalis, but suggest that some of its effects may be ameliorated by maternal responses during pregnancy, particularly in viviparous populations.  2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

The Directive 2010/63/EU requires the full implementation of the 3-R Principle of Russel and Burch in animal experiments, which means not only to replace the use of animals, but also to reduce the number of animals used and to refine procedures whenever possible. In response to this issue, the aim of this study was to validate an alternative, less invasive sampling method by cutting feathers close to the skin in comparison to the gold standard of plucking them. For this proof-of-principle study, a conventional poultry husbandry with trial groups of geese (Anser anser domesticus) and ducks (Anas sterilis) was selected. All birds were kept under the same living conditions to standardize the influencing factors regarding husbandry, and thus, their stress levels. Feather samples were collected between the shoulders from 46 geese and 51 ducks, both by cutting as well as by plucking, directly after slaughter for meat production. Feather corticosterone levels were measured with Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Results were compared using BlandAltman plots and concordance correlation coefficients (CCC). It could be seen that concordance between corticosterone levels in cut and plucked feathers was rather poor: 0.38 for Anser, and 0.57 for Anas. However, comparing the mean corticosterone values in pg/mm of each species with their respective standard deviations, the differences between the methods were negligible. As the results showed that the differences between the individuals were markedly greater than the differences between the methods, the determination of corticosterone levels in cut feathers is valid compared to using plucked feathers. The validation tests of ELISA showed only acceptable repeatability and reliability. Hence, the results should be verified in further studies. In conclusion, it is recommended for future research to use cut instead of plucked feathers for corticosterone measurement.  2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

Beginning with maternal deposition of cortisol in the egg, followed by development of de novo synthesis, a hypo-responsive period, and finally the ability of the fish to appropriately increase whole-body levels of cortisol in response to a stressor. In the present study, we demonstrate a similar pattern of ontogeny in the cortisol response in lake sturgeon over two-year classes. Whole-body levels of cortisol were examined over two cohorts and found to be different in both concentration and timing of endogenous production. The 2016 cohort were found to have relatively high levels of cortisol and developed to first feeding approximately six days faster than the 2017 cohort with lower levels of cortisol. In the 2017 cohort, mRNA expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and glucocorticoid receptor 1 (GR1) increased just prior to the increase in cortisol and associated onset of exogenous feeding. Treatment in metyrapone, an inhibitor of 11-hydroxylase, significantly inhibited cortisol production and resulted in the inability of the fish to appropriately transition to exogenous feeding.

Thus, as climate change leads to rapid increases in water temperatures in rivers, aquatic ectotherms, such as fish may be highly impacted. Organisms can respond to these stressors through flexible and rapid phenotypic change induced via developmental and/or transgenerational plasticity. In oviparous species, gravid females may translate environmental stress across generations via increased exposure of eggs to maternally derived glucocorticoids (i.e., maternal stress), which has been shown to result in diverse phenotypic effects in offspring. Recent studies suggest these phenotypic changes from maternal glucocorticoids may elicit predictive adaptive responses, where offspring exposed to maternal stress may be better prepared for the stressful environment they will encounter (i.e., environmental match hypothesis). We applied the environmental match hypothesis to examine whether a prenatal exogenous increase in egg cortisol may prepare Chinook salmon offspring (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) to cope with thermal challenges after being reared in chronically elevated temperatures. Specifically, we exposed eggs to aqueous bath of cortisol-dosed (1,000 ng/mL) or control (0 ng/ml) solutions, and then raised both treatments at current (+0Ccontemporary ambient river temperature) or elevated (+3Cprojected future river temperature) thermal regimes. We quantified thermal performance in fish 79 month post fertilization using two methods: via critical thermal maximum (CTMax), and energetic responses (in plasma cortisol, glucose, and lactate) to environmentally relevant, but challenging thermal spikes over 3 days. Overall, we found that exposure to elevated rearing temperatures had a large impact on thermal tolerance, where elevated-temperature reared offspring had significantly higher CTMax. In comparison, egg cortisol treatment had little to no clear effects on CTMax and blood energetic response. Our study demonstrates the importance of elevated water temperatures as an inducer of offspring phenotypes (via early developmental cues), and highlights the significance of examining offspring performance in environments with ecologically relevant stressors.

So far, the studies that experimentally investigated the consequences of maternal THs focused on short-term effects, while early organisational effects with long-term consequences, as shown for other prenatal hormones, could also be expected. In this study, we aimed at investigating both the short- and long-term effects of prenatal THs in a bird species, the Japanese quail Coturnix japonica. We experimentally elevated yolk TH content (the prohormone T4, and its active metabolite T3, as well as a combination of both hormones). We analysed hatching success, embryonic development, offspring growth and oxidative stress as well as their potential organisational effects on reproduction, moult and oxidative stress in adulthood. We found that eggs injected with T4 had a higher hatching success compared with control eggs, suggesting conversion of T4 into T3 by the embryo. We detected no evidence for other short-term or long-term effects of yolk THs. These results suggest that yolk THs are important in the embryonic stage of precocial birds, but other short- and long-term consequences remain unclear. Research on maternal THs will greatly benefit from studies investigating how embryos use and respond to this maternal signalling. Long-term studies on prenatal THs in other taxa in the wild are needed for a better understanding of this hormone-mediated maternal pathway.  2020 Sarraude et al."

Yet organisms live in multifaceted environments that are dynamic and ever changing, making it difficult to understand how complex adaptations evolve. This problem is particularly apparent in the evolution of adaptive maternal effects, which are often assumed to require reliable and discrete cues that predict conditions in the offspring environment. One resolution to this problem is if adaptive maternal effects evolve through preexisting, generalized maternal pathways that respond to many cues and also influence offspring development. Here, we assess whether an adaptive maternal effect in western bluebirds is influenced by maternal stress pathways across multiple challenging environments. Combining 18 years of hormone sampling across diverse environmental contexts with an experimental manipulation of the competitive environment, we show that multiple environmental factors influenced maternal corticosterone levels, which, in turn, influenced a maternal effect on aggression of sons in adulthood. Together, these results support the idea that multiple stressors can induce a known maternal effect in this system. More generally, they suggest that activation of general pathways, such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, may simplify and facilitate the evolution of adaptive maternal effects by integrating variable environmental conditions into preexisting maternal physiological systems.  2020 by The University of Chicago."

We evaluated how adoptive quail mothers (unstressed) raised chicks of females that had either been stressed (PS) or were non-stressed (NPS) during laying. We demonstrated previously that our social stress procedure during laying increases levels of egg yolk steroid and chicks emotional reactivity during the postnatal period. We found that, compared to NPS mothers, PS mothers remained closer to their chicks, were aggressed and neglected them less, emitted more maternal vocalisations and called their chicks more when they were separated. Moreover, PS chicks made more requests on their mother. Our results show that mothers responded to chicks behavioural changes caused by prenatal stress by adapting their maternal behaviour. As exemplified here, for the first time in birds, prenatal environment can affect postnatal maternal behaviour by changing their offspring's behaviour.  2020"

In contrast, the CORT-adaptation hypothesis suggests that, during energetically demanding periods, CORT will mediate physiological or behavioral changes that result in increased reproductive investment and success (a positive relationship). During two breeding seasons, we experimentally manipulated circulating CORT levels in female tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) prior to egg laying, and measured subsequent reproductive effort, breeding success, and maternal survival.

By considering variation among females, we found support for the CORT-adaptation hypothesis; there was a significant positive relationship between CORT levels during incubation and hatching and fledging success.

While the stress response happens on a short time-scale, chronic stress results over longer time-scales. Therefore, the temporal dynamics of techniques used to assess stress need to be fully understood in order to be applied correctly. In this review, we provide information on 37 physiological and behavioural metrics that are commonly used to measure stress, especially in wild free-living vertebrates, with a particular focus on which time-scale they integrate stress. We organize these metrics into seven broad categories based on which physiological system they are most closely associated with (glucocorticoids, sympathetic/parasympathetic nervous system, immune, metabolic, cellular/molecular, tissue development and behaviour). We conclude by summarizing which kind of biological questions and variation each technique is most suitable for.

The goal of this systematic review is three-fold. First, we will describe how multilevel models with multiple random effects (i.e., hierarchical three-, four-, five-level models and cross-classified random effects models) are applied in meta-analysis. Second, we will illustrate how in some specific three-level meta-analyses, a more sophisticated model could have been used to deal with additional dependencies in the data. Third and last, we will describe the distribution of the characteristics of multilevel meta-analyses (e.g., distribution of the number of outcomes across studies or which dependencies are typically modeled) so that future simulation studies can simulate more realistic conditions. Results showed that four- or five-level or cross-classified random effects models are not often used although they might account better for the meta-analytic data structure of the analyzed datasets. Also, we found that the simulation studies done on multilevel meta-analysis with multiple random factors could have used more realistic simulation factor conditions.

However, embryos that use most, or all, of their yolk supply before hatching should hatch at a larger size than those that do not exhaust those energy reserves, which could also have benefits for posthatching growth and survival. To examine the trade-off between residual yolk and offspring size, we experimentally reduced yolk quantity at oviposition in lizard eggs (Amphibolurus mu-ricatus) and then quantified offspring size and the amount of internalized residual yolk. This design enabled us to determine whether embryos (1) exhaust yolk supply during development (thereby maximizing neonatal size) or (2) reduce neonatal size by retaining yolk reserves at hatching. Our data support the latter scenario. Eggs from the yolk-reduced treatment produced smaller offspring with a proportion of residual yolk similar to that of offspring from unmanipulated eggs, suggesting that the fitness benefits of posthatching energy stores outweigh those of larger neonatal size.  2020 by The University of Chicago.

Examining the development of the hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis and its responsiveness, or lack thereof, during development are important for understanding the short- and long-term impacts of stressors on embryonic and larval fish. We examined the ontogeny of the HPI axis in embryonic (21, 38, 63, 83 and 103 days post-fertilisation (dpf)) and larval (1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks post-hatch (wph)) lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) by quantifying changes in mRNA levels of several genes associated with HPI axis functioning and whole animal cortisol levels throughout development and in response to a severe or mild hypoxic stress. Cortisol, and crh, crhbp1, pomc and star transcripts were detected from the earliest embryonic age studied. Cortisol levels in control embryos decreased between 21 and 63 dpf, suggesting the utilisation of maternal cortisol deposits. However, by 83 dpf (70% developed) endogenous de novo synthesis had generated a 4.5-fold increase in whole embryo cortisol. Importantly, we provide novel data showing that the HPI axis can be activated even earlier. Whole body cortisol increased in eyed lake whitefish embryos (38 dpf; ~32% developed) in response to hypoxia stress. Coincident with this hypoxia-induced increase in cortisol in 38 dpf embryos were corresponding increases in crh, crhbp1, pomc and star transcript levels. Beyond 38 dpf, the HPI axis in lake whitefish embryos was hyporesponsive to hypoxia stress at all embryonic ages examined (63, 83 and 103 dpf; 54, 72 and 85% developed, respectively). Post-hatch, larvae responded to hypoxia with an increase in cortisol levels and HPI axis genes at 1 wph, but this response was lost and larvae appeared hyporesponsive at subsequent ages (2, 3 and 4 wph). Collectively our work demonstrates that during fish embryogenesis and the larval stage there are windows where the HPI axis is responsive and windows where it is truly hyporesponsive; both could be beneficial in ensuring undisrupted development particularly in the face of increasing environmental changes.  2020 Elsevier Inc."

In vertebrates, prolactin and corticosterone are two important hormones that regulate parental investment because they stimulate parental care and mobilize energy, respectively. Further, concentrations of both hormones change in response to disturbances. One of the most important parental care behaviors in birds is incubation, since small changes in egg temperature have large effects on offspring. We investigated how prolactin and corticosterone may mediate parental incubation constancy (i.e., the daily amount of time spent incubating eggs) and regulation of egg temperature. We collected blood samples from female wood ducks (Aix sponsa) near the start and end of the incubation period to measure baseline and stress-induced (30 min after capture and restraint) hormone concentrations. We also quantified incubation constancy and egg temperature using artificial egg temperature loggers. As expected, prolactin decreased and corticosterone increased after 30 min of capture and restraint. Corticosterone concentrations (baseline and stress-induced) were negatively related to body mass, but were not related to incubation constancy. In contrast, prolactin concentrations (baseline and stress-induced) were higher at the end than the start of the incubation period, and stress-induced prolactin concentrations were positively related to incubation constancy following a nest disturbance (i.e., capture). Further, prolactin (baseline and stress-induced) concentrations were positively related to egg temperatures, but only after the disturbance. These results suggest that prolactin may be associated with the regulation of parental incubation constancy and resulting heat-transfer after a disturbance, which may ultimately affect offspring development.  2020 Elsevier Inc."

To understand this disconnect, we examined transcriptional and behavioral responses to prolactin in brown-headed (Molothrus ater) and bronzed (M aeneus) brood parasitic cowbirds. We first examine prolactin-dependent regulation of transcriptome wide gene expression in the preoptic area (POA), a brain region associated with parental care across vertebrates. We next examined prolactin-dependent abundance of seven parental care-related candidate genes in hypothalamic regions that are prolactin-responsive in other avian species. We found no evidence of prolactin sensitivity in cowbirds in either case. To understand this prolactin insensitivity, we compared prolactin receptor transcript abundance between parasitic and nonparasitic species and between prolactin treated and untreated cowbirds. We observed significantly lower prolactin receptor transcript abundance in brown-headed but not bronzed cowbird POA compared with a nonparasite and no prolactin-dependent changes in either parasitic species. Finally, estrogen-primed female brown-headed cowbirds with or without prolactin treatment exhibited significantly greater avoidance of nestling begging stimuli compared with untreated birds. Taken together, our results suggest that modified prolactin receptor distributions in the POA and surrounding hypothalamic regions disconnect prolactin from parental care in brood parasitic cowbirds.  2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and International Behavioural and Neural Genetics Society"

These discrepancies may arise because the fitness costs and benefits of MHC diversity differ among individuals depending on their exposure and immune responses to parasites. Here, we investigated in black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) chicks whether associations between MHC class-II diversity and fitness vary with sex and hatching order. MHC-II diversity was positively associated with growth and tick clearance in female chicks, but not in male chicks. Our data also revealed a positive association between MHC-II diversity and survival in second-hatched female chicks (two eggs being the typical clutch size). These findings may result from condition-dependent parasite infections differentially impacting sexes in relation to hatching order.

For example, long periods of sustained locomotion in migrating birds are supported by the androgenic up-regulation of aerobic factors, such as new red blood cell production and hematocrit. However, towards the end of migration, many female birds begin up-regulating 17-estradiol (E2) to support vitellogenesis and egg production, but E2 secretion is known to have suppressive effects on red blood cell production (anti-erythropoiesis). We explored potential trade-offs between factors related to aerobic performance (hematocrit, reticulocyte index) and the expression of factors related to E2-mediated vitellogenesis (i.e. yolk precursor production) in female macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus), a species in which the physiologies controlling egg production and migratory activity run simultaneously (e.g. females experience a migratory conflict). We collected blood samples from penguins immediately upon their return to the colony, prior to egg laying. Hematocrit was elevated when the penguins returned to the colony (50.05%  3.40 SD), which is similar to pre-laying values observed in other migratory bird species. Furthermore, mean reticulocyte levels were elevated (34.87%  2.34), which is the highest level yet recorded in birds. Similarly, both plasma vitellogenin and yolk-targeted very low density lipoprotein levels were upregulated (2.30  0.06 g Zn ml1, and 9.70  0.19 mmol l1, respectively), indicating that penguins were reproductively active and producing eggs during migration and upon arrival on land. As predicted, a negative relationship between hematocrit and plasma vitellogenin was found, but we found no evidence to suggest that birds were experiencing reproductive anemia. Alternatively, we attribute the negative relationship to a hemodilution effect of yolk precursor secretion into circulation. It appears that female macaroni penguins are able to preserve hematocrit levels and new red blood cell production when migratory activity overlaps with reproductive processes.  2020"

Interestingly, this high degree of territoriality persists during the non-breeding season, despite low levels of circulating gonadal steroids (ie, testosterone [T] and oestradiol [E2]). Our previous work suggests that the pineal hormone melatonin mediates a seasonal switch from gonadal to adrenal regulation of aggression in Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus); solitary, seasonally breeding mammals that display increased aggression during the short, winter-like days (SDs) of the non-breeding season. To test the hypothesis that melatonin elevates non-breeding aggression by increasing circulating and neural steroid metabolism, we housed female hamsters in long days (LDs) or SDs, administered them timed or mis-timed melatonin injections (mimic or do not mimic a SD-like signal, respectively), and measured aggression, circulating hormone profiles and aromatase (ARO) immunoreactivity in brain regions associated with aggressive or reproductive behaviours (paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus [PVN], periaqueductal gray [PAG] and ventral tegmental area [VTA]). Females that were responsive to SD photoperiods (SD-R) and LD females given timed melatonin injections (Mel-T) exhibited gonadal regression and reduced circulating E2, but increased aggression and circulating dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Furthermore, aggressive challenges differentially altered circulating hormone profiles across seasonal phenotypes; reproductively inactive females (ie, SD-R and Mel-T females) reduced circulating DHEA and T, but increased E2 after an aggressive interaction, whereas reproductively active females (ie, LD females, SD non-responder females and LD females given mis-timed melatonin injections) solely increased circulating E2. Although no differences in neural ARO abundance were observed, LD and SD-R females showed distinct associations between ARO cell density and aggressive behaviour in the PVN, PAG and VTA.

One-hundred twenty 52-week-old laying hens were raised in three temperature-controlled facilities with constant humidity (50% RH), either normal temperature (LT; 22C) or heat stress considered being moderate (MT; 27C) or severe (HT; 32C) for 42 days. Feed intakes were consistently low (p < 0.01) in HT hens compared with those in LT or MT over the period of 42 days. Egg production kept markedly (p < 0.05) or numerically (p > 0.05) low in hens exposed to HT vs. LT or MT. Egg mass and egg weight were consistently low (p < 0.01) in hens exposed to HT compared with those raised under LT or MT. On the other hand, feed conversion ratio and frequency of dirty and cracked eggs were not significantly affected (p > 0.05) during the experimental period. HT-exposed hens consistently had lowered (p < 0.05) eggshell thickness and breaking strength, eggshell weight, and plasma Ca, P, and Mg levels compared with LT- or MT-treated hens. HT hens had lower (p < 0.01) relative oviduct weight and less number of large yellow follicles compared with those raised under LT or MT conditions at 42 days. Tibia traits measured at 42 days were not affected by any of heat treatments. Fecal volatile fatty acids tended to be higher in HT-exposed laying hens throughout the experiment. It was noted that digestibilities of neutral detergent fiber and dry matter were lowest (p < 0.05) in hens exposed to HT vs. LT or MT environments. Our study suggests that heat stress could lower laying performance, egg quality, and physiological parameters that are coupled with alterations in gut metabolites and mineral/lipid metabolism. The findings emerged from this study will help us design the nutritional and environmental strategies to mitigate the negative effect of heat stress on laying hens.

To assess the strength of such transgenerational effects we propose a strategy aimed at overcoming the problem of type I errors when testing multiple proxies of stress in multiple ancestors against multiple offspring performance traits, and we apply it to a large observational dataset on captive zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). We combine clear one-tailed hypotheses with steps of validation, meta-analytic summary of mean effect sizes, and independent confirmatory testing. We find that drastic differences in early growth conditions (nestling body mass 8 days after hatching varied sevenfold between 1.7 and 12.4 g) had only moderate direct effects on adult morphology (95% confidence interval [CI]: r = 0.190.27) and small direct effects on adult fitness traits (r = 0.020.12). In contrast, we found no indirect effects of parental or grandparental condition (r = 0.017 to 0.002; meta-analytic summary of 138 effect sizes), and mixed evidence for small benefits of matching environments between parents and offspring, as the latter was not robust to confirmatory testing in independent datasets. This study shows that evolution has led to a remarkable robustness of zebra finches against undernourishment.

Thus, begging has direct fitness benefits as it enhances offspring growth and survival. It is nevertheless subject to a complex evolutionary trajectory, because begging may serve as a means for the offspring to manipulate parents in the context of evolutionary conflicts of interest. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that begging is coadapted and potentially genetically correlated with parental care traits as a result of social selection. Further experiments on the causal processes that shape the evolution of begging are therefore essential. We applied bidirectional artificial selection on begging behaviour, using canaries (Serinus canaria) as a model species. We measured the response to selection, the consequences for offspring development, changes in parental care traits, here the rate of parental provisioning, as well as the effects on reproductive success. After three generations of selection, offspring differed in begging behaviour according to our artificial selection regime: nestlings of the high begging line begged significantly more than nestlings of the low begging line. Intriguingly, begging less benefitted the nestlings, as reflected by on average significantly higher growth rates, and increased reproductive success in terms of a higher number of fledglings in the low selected line. Begging could thus represent an exaggerated trait, possibly because parentoffspring conflict enhanced the selection on begging. We did not find evidence that we co-selected on parental provisioning, which may be due to the lack of power, but may also suggest that the evolution of begging is probably not constrained by a genetic correlation between parental provisioning and offspring begging.  2020 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

In contrast, in birds, estrogens produced by females induce demasculinization, but whether microglia are involved in this process is unknown. This study assessed whether microglial number, morphology, and/or activity differ between the sexes in selected regions of the developing quail brain and whether they are influenced by estrogens. We found a robust female-biased sex difference in microglial numbers between embryonic day 9 and 12 in the medial preoptic nucleus (POM), a key region for the expression of male sexual behavior. This difference relies on estrogens produced during the sensitive period. Although most embryonic microglia express iNOS, the expression of iNOS in individual microglia does not differ between sexes. Finally, microglial number and the expression of iNOS were not affected by the microglia inhibitor minocycline. Together, these results revealed an estrogen-dependent sex difference in microglia during the critical period for the sexual differentiation of the quail brain. This difference mirrors the different role of estrogens in the development of birds and rodents and suggests a role for microglia in the sexual differentiation of the brain of birds, as in rodents, thus supporting the hypothesis of a conserved role of the neuroimmune system in the organization of the brain by estrogens.  2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC"

Cooler temperatures extend development time and can increase the amount of energy required to achieve hatching success, which can pose fitness consequences later in life. Yet, for locally-adapted populations, genetic variation can oppose environmental variation across ecological gradients, known as countergradient variation (CnGV). Biologists often seek to understand the presence of phenotypic variation, yet the absence of such variation across environmental gradients can also reveal insights into the mechanisms underlying local adaptation. While evidence for genetic variation opposing environmental variation in physiological rates has been summarized in other taxa, the generality of CnGV variation in reptiles is yet unknown. Here I present a summary of studies measuring development time and metabolic rates in locally-adapted populations across thermal clines for 15 species of reptiles across 8 families. CnGV in development time is found to be common, while no clear pattern emerges for the thermal sensitivity of metabolic rates across locally-adapted populations. CnGV in development time may be an adaptive response in order to decrease the costly development in cool climates, however, empirical work is needed to disentangle plastic from genetic responses, and to uncover potentially general mechanisms of local thermal adaptation in reptiles.

For example, many viviparous lizards are cold adapted which may restrict their activity times during the reproductive season, increasing their susceptibility to global warming. However, it is unclear if and how lizards with different reproductive modes (oviparity vs. viviparity) can respond to rising temperatures by modifying their life-history traits. We examined the effect of developmental temperatures on hatchling behavior and learning in viviparous and oviparous populations of the lizard Saiphos equalis to test whether their reproductive behavior can buffer against rising temperatures. Gravid females from both populations were subjected to current or projected end-of-century (future) thermal environments to evaluate differences in the exploratory, foraging and antipredator behavior, and spatial learning ability of their offspring. We found that viviparous lizards were more exploratory and had a less-pronounced antipredator response than oviparous lizards. Regardless of the mode of reproduction, elevated temperatures reduced the exploratory behavior of hatchling lizards. Elevated temperatures also reduced the foraging efficiency of oviparous, but not viviparous, hatchlings. Finally, future-gestated oviparous hatchlings were more likely to choose the correct refuge and made fewer mistakes in a spatial learning task; however, we found only weak evidence of spatial learning in S. equalis. Our results suggest that although global warming is likely to have a negative impact on phenotypic traits, in S. equalis, some of these effects may be ameliorated by maternal behavior and/or physiological responses during pregnancy, particularly in viviparous populations. Significance statement: Computational modeling studies suggest that live-bearing lizards (viviparous) are more vulnerable to global warming compared with egg-laying ones (oviparous). However, there is little experimental evidence showing that viviparous species are indeed at a greater risk of extinction. Using a lizard species that has both oviparous and viviparous populations, we tested the effect of high developmental temperatures (projected for 2100) on the behavior and learning of their offspring. We found that elevated temperatures had a stronger negative effect on egg-laying lizards by producing hatchlings with lower foraging efficiency. Our results suggest that viviparous mothers can ameliorate some of the effects of global warming on their offspring. Moreover, our study suggests that if live bearers are indeed more vulnerable to global warming, it is likely not due to maladaptive behavior in offspring, but rather, to other causes that affect pregnant females.  2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Prey may respond differently to predation risk based on key traits such as sex, but the influence of sex-specific variation is typically explored in species with strong sexual dimorphism. However, sex-specific responses to predation risk may arise even in prey species lacking sexual dimorphisms based on differences in the relative cost of reproduction. Using a rocky intertidal food chain, we conducted a laboratory mesocosm experiment to explore sex-specific responses of morphologically similar, reproductively mature prey (the snail Nucella lapillus) to predation risk and whether risk affected female fecundity. We found that predation risk suppressed prey growth only in males via effects on growth efficiency, suggesting that sex-specific disparities may arise due to differences in the energy required for reproduction and/or the costs of mounting a physiological stress response. Moreover, while risk did not affect overall female fecundity, it eliminated the positive relationship between female size and fecundity observed in the absence of risk. We hypothesize that these sex-specific disparities arise due to differences in the energy required for reproduction and/or the costs of mounting a physiological stress response. Reproduction is likely more energetically costly for females than males, so females may display weaker antipredator responses in order to maintain energetic reserves needed for reproduction. Our results suggest that sex-specific responses may be an important component of inter-individual differences in prey responses to risk and influence prey population growth and demography even in species lacking sexual dimorphism.

Our understanding of sex ratio evolution independent of these confounds, in addition toany putative links between skewed sex ratios and other factors (e.g. life history), therefore remains largely unexplored. Here, we conducted an exploratory study investigating differences in sex ratios across closely related species while controlling for extrinsic mortality. We also tested two factors, non-overlapping/overlapping generations and the social environment, which have both been hypothesised to affect sex ratios. Specifically, we raised 15 species of killifish, which have either overlapping or discrete generations, under both solitary and social treatments. We found substantial divergences in sex ratios across closely related species, which exhibited both male and female biases. In conjunction with a low phylogenetic signal, our results suggest that sex ratios can evolve rapidly in this group. However, we found no evidence that overlapping generations or the social environment affected sex biases, suggesting that other factors drive the rapid evolution of sex ratios in killifishes.  2020, The Author(s)."

Through indoor manipulative experiments, we assessed here the effects of the temporal regime of reworking of contaminated sediment from the Bagnoli-Coroglio brownfield (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy) on the fertilization process in Paracentrotus lividus. Adult sea urchins were kept for one month in tanks containing contaminated sediment that was re-suspended according to two temporal patterns of water turbulence differing in the time intervals between consecutive events of agitation (mimicking the storms naturally occurring in the study area) in seawater with natural vs. supersaturated oxygenation levels. At the end of the treatment, gametes were collected and used to test the hypothesis that the regime of contaminated sediment reworking negatively, but reversibly, affects morphological and physiological traits of the fertilized eggs. We found that aggregated events of sediment re-suspension had profound negative effects on gamete interactions and Ca2+ signaling at fertilization. The same experimental condition also inflicted marked ultrastructural changes in eggs. Importantly, however, such detrimental effects were inhibited by increased oxygenation. By contrast, the regime of sediment re-working with a longer interval between consecutive turbulent events had only marginal effects. Thus, the current and predicted changes of climate-related disturbance appear to modulate the biological effects of chronic contamination in post-industrial areas, suggesting that environmental rehabilitation via restoration of habitat-forming primary producers such as seagrasses or algal canopies could alleviate the pollutants effects on resident biota.  2020 Elsevier Ltd"

Hormone concentrations, however, are labile, responding to both internal and external stimuli, so the relationship between hormones and fitness can be non-consistent. One explanation of this inconsistent relationship is that a single hormone sample may not be representative of individual phenotypes in a free-living species. We addressed this issue by repeatedly sampling a free-living population of mountain white-crowned sparrows, Zonotrichia leucophrys oriantha, for baseline and stress-induced corticosterone (cort) and testosterone (T) across different stages of the breeding season. We measured (co)variation using three different methods, taking into account inter- and intra-individual variances, to determine whether hormone levels and the stress response are repeatable. We documented the temporal (over 3 months) and spatial (home-range) variation of individual hormone phenotypes and investigated how these components related to nesting success. At the population level, we found significant repeatability in male stress-induced cort concentrations but no repeatability in male or female baseline cort or male T concentrations. Using a new metric of intra-individual variance focusing on the stress response (profile repeatability), we found a wide range of variance scores, with most individuals showing high variation in their stress response. Similarly, we found a low level of repeatability of the reaction norm intercept and slope for the stress response across different life-history stages. Males with higher concentrations of stress-induced cort had more central home-ranges. Males with higher body condition had larger home-ranges; however, home-range size did not relate to male hormone concentrations or nesting success. We also did not find any significant relationship between variation in hormone levels and nesting success. We recommend that future studies combine both physiological and environmental components to better understand the relationship between hormones and fitness.  2020 Elsevier Inc."

It is believed that the pituitary hormone prolactin plays an important role in such allocation processes. Incubation does not solely imply the active warming of the eggs but also the active egg-turning to facilitate absorption of albumen by the embryo, reduce malposition and prevent the embryo from adhering to the inner shell membrane. However, how prolactin secretion is related to egg-turning behaviors is presently poorly addressed. In addition, several environmental contaminants can affect parental care behaviors through their endocrine disrupting properties but the effects of such contaminants on egg-turning behaviors remain so far unexplored. Using artificial eggs equipped with miniaturized data loggers, we investigated the relationships between egg-turning behaviors, prolactin secretion and contaminants burden in Arctic black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla). Specifically, we examined the relationships between blood concentrations of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), organochlorines (OCs), mercury (Hg), plasma prolactin levels and both egg-turning frequency and angular change. We also incorporated baseline corticosterone levels since this glucocorticoid is known to affect parental care. Plasma prolactin levels were positively related to angular change in female kittiwakes while corticosterone was not related to egg-turning behaviors in either sex. Hg was not related to egg-turning behaviors in either sex. We found contrasting associations between OCs and PFASs, since polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were negatively associated with angular change in females, contrary to linear perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOSlin) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) which were positively related to egg-turning frequency and angular change in both sexes. Additionally, PFASs concentrations were positively related to prolactin levels in female kittiwake. The possible stimulation of prolactin secretion by PFASs could therefore make adult kittiwakes to allocate more time taking care of their eggs, and thus possibly modify the trade-off between spending enough time caring for the clutch and obtaining enough nutrients at sea.  2020 Elsevier Inc."

However, developing young of altricial species typically have a damped glucocorticoid stress response. The developmental hypothesis posits that the physiological stress response should develop concurrently with an individual's ability to respond to a challenge. The dampened response may benefit an organism, as chronic exposure to glucocorticoids can have short- and long-term detrimental effects, and altricial young are unable to escape most stressors. However, we do not know if or why species with similar ontogeny vary in their development of the physiological stress response. We assessed levels of baseline and stress-induced corticosterone (the main avian glucocorticoid) in six passerine species with varying life-history strategies, including a brood parasite, the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater). Circulating baseline corticosterone levels increased with nestling age for all species. Stress-induced corticosterone levels sampled at 15-min post-capture significantly increased with nestling age at a similar rate and magnitude in brown-headed cowbirds, eastern phoebes (Sayornis phoebe), hooded warblers (Setophaga citrina), red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), and song sparrows (Melospiza melodia). However, gray catbird (Dumetella carolinensis) nestlings showed an extremely dampened elevation in corticosterone in response to stress, even near fledge. Gray catbirds are unusual among songbirds, as they are open-ended song learners. Stress during development can profoundly influence avian song learning and performance abilities.

In insects, there is also evidence that females deposit juvenile hormones (JH) and ecdysteroids (ESH) in their eggs, hormones that play a key role in regulating offspring growth and metamorphosis. However, it is unclear whether females adjust their hormonal deposition in eggs in response to prenatal environmental conditions. Here we address this gap by conducting an experiment on the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides, in which we manipulated the presence of the male parent and the size of the carcass used for breeding at the time of laying. We also tested for effects of the condition (i.e., body mass) of the parents. We then recorded subsequent effects on JH and ESH concentrations in the eggs. We found no evidence for an effect of these prenatal environmental conditions (male presence and carcass size) on hormonal concentration in the eggs. However, we found that females reduced their deposition of JH when mated with heavier males. This finding is consistent with negative differential allocation of maternal hormones in response to variation in the body mass of the male parent.

As reproductive seasons progress, females often shift from greater energetic investment in many small offspring towards investing less total energy into fewer, better provisioned (i.e. larger) offspring. The underlying causes of this pattern have not been assessed in many systems. Two primary hypotheses have been proposed to explain these patterns. The first is an adaptive hypothesis from life-history theory: early offspring have a survival advantage over those produced later. Accordingly, selection favours females that invest in offspring quantity early in the season and offspring quality later. The second hypothesis suggests these patterns are not intrinsic but result from passive responses to seasonal changes in the environment experienced by reproducing females (i.e. maternal environment). To disentangle the causes underlying this pattern, which has been reported in brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei), we performed complementary field and laboratory studies. The laboratory study carefully controlled maternal environments and quantified reproductive patterns throughout the reproductive season for each female. The field study measured similar metrics from free ranging lizards across an entire reproductive season. In the laboratory, females increased relative effort per offspring as the reproductive season progressed; smaller eggs were laid earlier, larger eggs were laid later. Moreover, we observed significant among-individual variation in seasonal changes in reproduction, which is necessary for traits to evolve via natural selection. Because these patterns consistently emerge under controlled laboratory conditions, they likely represent an intrinsic and potentially adaptive adjustment of reproductive effort as predicted by life-history theory. The field study revealed similar trends, further suggesting that intrinsic patterns observed in the laboratory are strong enough to persist despite the environmental variability that characterizes natural habitats. The observed patterns are indicative of an adaptive seasonal shift in parental investment in response to a deteriorating offspring environment: allocating greater resources to late-produced offspring likely enhances maternal fitness.  2020 British Ecological Society"

Often this research emphasizes the maladaptive effects of early stressful experiences. Here we posit that the HPAA and HPAG systems in human developmental plasticity have evolved to be responsive to complex and dynamic problems associated with human sociality. The lengthy period of human offspring dependency, and its associated brain development and risks, is linked to the uniquely human combination of stable breeding bonds, extensive paternal effort in a multi-male group, extended bilateral kin recognition, grandparenting, and controlled exchange of mates among kin groups. We evaluate an evolutionary framework that integrates proximate physiological explanations with ontogeny, phylogeny, adaptive function, and comparative life history data.  2020 Elsevier B.V."

Physiological stress reactions have been shown to affect the immune system of an animal and therefore may also affect the amount of maternal antibodies a female transmits to her offspring. A few studies have revealed that the presence of predators affects the amount of maternal antibodies deposited into eggs of birds. In this study, using Eurasian blue and great tit offspring (Cyanistes caeruleus and Parus major) as model species, we experimentally tested whether human recreation induces changes in the amount of circulating antibodies in young nestlings and whether this effect is modulated by habitat and competition. Moreover, we investigated whether these variations in antibody titre in turn have an impact on hatching success and offspring growth. Nestlings of great tit females that had been disturbed by experimental human recreation during egg laying had lower antibody titres compared with control nestlings. Antibody titre of nestling blue tits showed a negative correlation with the presence of great tits, rather than with human disturbance. The hatching success was positively correlated with the average amount of antibodies in great tit nestlings, independent of the treatment. Antibody titre in the first days of life in both species was positively correlated with body mass, but this relationship disappeared at fledging and was independent of treatment. We suggest that human recreation may have caused a stress-driven activation of the HPA axis in breeding females, chronically increasing their circulating corticosterone, which is known to have an immunosuppressive function. Either, lower amounts of antibodies are transmitted to nestlings or impaired transfer mechanisms lead to lower amounts of immunoglobulins in the eggs. Human disturbance could, therefore, have negative effects on nestling survival at early life-stages, when nestlings are heavily reliant on maternal antibodies, and in turn lead to lower breeding success and parental fitness. This is a so far overlooked effect of disturbance on early life in birds.  2020 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd."

Here, zebrafish (Danio rerio) was employed to investigate the transgenerational impacts of an immunotoxic and endocrine disruptor, atrazine (AZ). In addition, the possible ameliorated effects of a nutraceutical, Arthrospira platensis (spirulina- SP), was considered. Adult females were either exposed to 0 (Cn), 5 (AZ5), and 50 (AZ50) g/L AZ or fed SP-supplemented diet (10 g/kg; SP). In combination treatments, fish were also exposed to AZ and fed SP (SP-AZ5 and SP-AZ50). Embryos were obtained after 28 d of exposure. Exposure to AZ50 caused females to produce eggs with significantly lower fertilization and hatching. No changes were observed in the concentrations of thyroid hormones. AZ significantly increased cortisol response and reduced levels of immunoglobulin, lysozyme and complement activities in females and their offspring. SP-AZ5 and SP-AZ50 females, however, resisted to the toxic effects of AZ, produced embryos with lower cortisol content and higher immunity competence. Bactericidal activity of the embryos also showed the transgenerational antimicrobial effects of SP along with the AZ immunotoxicity. Overall, these results indicate that AZ could have long lasting toxic effects on fish, and that dietary SP-supplementation could ameliorate AZ induced transgenerational toxic effects.  2019"

Young, nest-bound birds are exposed to a diversity of nest-dwelling ectoparasites that typically feed on their blood. Within broods, hatching asynchrony creates size hierarchies that result in morphological and physiological variation among nest mates, and susceptibility to parasites also may vary predictably with this size hierarchy. Our objective was to use a broad-spectrum, anti-parasite drug, ivermectin (IVM), to treat individual nestling Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) and assess how nestling susceptibility to parasites varied both within and among broods. Broods were either assigned to an IVM group, where half of the nestlings in a brood received IVM injections and half received control injections of pure sesame oil, or to a control group, where all nestlings received oil injections. We found that the IVM treatment reduced parasite loads for broods as a whole, thereby benefiting all nestlings in IVM broods and suggesting our treatment resulted in herd immunity. Specifically, nestlings from IVM broods had higher hemoglobin concentrations, regardless of whether they received injections with IVM or oil, and greater fledging success, than nestlings from control broods. On the contrary, IVM treatment did not strongly affect nestling morphology, with only marginal effects on the growth rate of ninth primary feathers, and the effects of the treatment on 2 other morphological traits depending on temporal factors. Variation in size within broods, however, influenced the chance of an individual fledging, which increased with relative size within a brood, but only under lower parasite loads (i.e. IVM broods). By experimentally manipulating nestling susceptibility to parasites, we have demonstrated variation in nestling response to an anti-parasite treatment both within and among broods, and future studies should investigate the underlying mechanism for why certain nestlings along the brood size hierarchy are more susceptible to parasites.

In this study, we investigated the effects of maternal stress on the behavior of different strains of laying hens and the role of corticosterone as its mediator. For this, fertilized eggs of five genetic linestwo brown (Brown 1 and 2), two white (White 1 and 2), and one pure line White Leghornwere reared identically as four flocks of 27 birds (24F: 3M) per strain. Each strain was equally separated into two groups: Maternal Stress (MS), where hens were subjected to a series of daily acute psychological stressors for 8 days before egg collection, and Control, which received routine husbandry. Fertile eggs from both treatments were collected at three different ages forming different offspring groups that were treated as replicates; additional eggs from Control were injected either with corticosterone diluted in a vehicle solution (CORT) or just Vehicle. Eggs from each replicate were incubated and hatched, and offspring (N = 1,919) were brooded under identical conditions. To measure the effects of maternal stress on anxiety and fear-like behavior, offspring were subjected to a social isolation test (SI) between 5 and 10 days of age and a tonic immobility test (TI) at 9 weeks of age. Compared to Control, MS decreased the number of distress vocalizations emitted by White 2 in SI. No effects of MS were observed in TI, and no effects of CORT were observed in any tests. Overall, brown lines vocalized more in SI and remained in TI for a longer duration than white strains, suggesting genetic differences in fear behavior. Females vocalized more than males in TI and showed a trend toward significance for the same trait in SI. Overall, results suggest that the effects of maternal stress on fearfulness are not directly mediated by corticosterone. Moreover, it highlights behavioral differences across various strains of laying hens, suggesting that fear responses are highly dependent on genotype.

Maternal stress can programme physiological and behavioural phenotypes in offspring, which may be maladaptive if maternal and offspring environments are mismatched. We investigated effects of a match and mismatch between egg cortisol and offspring stress levels in lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, using artificially elevated egg cortisol levels (simulating maternal stress) and a chronic unpredictable stress regime for offspring after hatch. Offspring cortisol levels were quantified at baseline and after an acute stressor. Multiple measures of offspring swimming activity were assessed in behaviour trials. Individuals that experienced elevated egg cortisol and high offspring stress exhibited a diminished cortisol response to an acute stressor, but responses varied among offspring from different families. Results suggest that the interaction between maternal and offspring experience may cue an offspring phenotype that is adaptive in high-stress conditions. Principal components analysis characterizing interindividual variation in offspring behavioural variables showed that treatment significantly affected multivariate offspring response along the PC1 axis (associated with inactivity), and both treatment and family significantly affected response along the PC2 axis (associated with shorter distance moved). The largest differences for PC1 occurred between the mismatch treatments (high egg cortisol and low offspring stress exhibiting lower activity; low egg cortisol and high offspring stress exhibiting higher activity), indicating that the combination of egg cortisol and offspring stress is more important in determining offspring behaviour than is egg cortisol or offspring stress alone. Findings suggest that family effects, such as genetic components or maternal experience, may mediate how the interaction of maternal and offspring stress influences offspring physiological and behavioural outcomes, and indicate the need for further research into environmental factors experienced by females that influence how offspring respond to egg cortisol and early life stress.  2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour"

Although these maternal stress effects are often considered negative, recent studies suggest this maternal stress signal may prepare offspring for a similarly stressful environment (environmental match). We applied the environmental match hypothesis to examine whether a prenatal stress signal can dampen the effects of elevated water temperatures on body size, condition, and survival during early development in Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha from Lake Ontario, Canada. We exposed fertilized eggs to prenatal exogenous egg cortisol (1,000ng/ml cortisol or 0ng/ml control) and then reared these dosed groups at temperatures indicative of current (+0C) and future (+3C) temperature conditions. Offspring reared in elevated temperatures were smaller and had a lower survival at the hatchling developmental stage. Overall, we found that our exogenous cortisol dose did not dampen effects of elevated rearing temperatures (environmental match) on body size or early survival. Instead, our eyed stage survival indicates that our prenatal cortisol dose may be detrimental, as cortisol-dosed offspring raised in elevated temperatures had lower survival than cortisol-dosed and control reared in current temperatures. Our results suggest that a maternal stress signal may not be able to ameliorate the effects of thermal stress during early development.

They can have consistent differences in grazing patterns and occupy specific spatial domains, whilst developing tactics and strategies for foraging that are specific to their grazing personalities. In this review, we explore the development of our understanding of grazing personalities, as we move away from the search for an optimal animal toward designing behavior-customized herds with an arrangement of individual grazing personalities that enhance ecosystem services and productivity. We present a grazing personality model that accounts for the personality of individual animals and for collective behaviors of herds. We argue that grazing personalities of grazing ruminants and other large herbivores are in part genetically determined, and that they can act at the individual and collective level. The social and biophysical environments as well as the emotional state of animals regulate the expression of grazing genes that are observed phenotypically as distinct grazing personalities. The reproductive and sexual successes of individuals and herds filter for allele variants of grazing genes and in turn determines their relative frequency. While the selection of one grazing personality may be adequate for homogeneous pastoral systems, the design of herds with a range of grazing personalities that are matched to the habitat diversity may be a better approach to improving the distribution of grazing animals, enhancing ecosystem services, and maximizing productivity.

The systematic changes of yolk hormone concentrations within asynchronously hatching clutches have been interpreted as a means to adaptively shape the offspring's phenotype. However, in synchronously hatching clutches the role of yolk hormones is less understood. We investigated whether seasonal changes between eggs in the yolk hormones testosterone (Testo), progesterone (Prog) and corticosterone (Cort) also occur in the grey partridge, a synchronously hatching precocial species without direct food competition between siblings. Specifically we asked whether yolk hormone concentrations systematically vary with season and whether they affect the offspring's hatching mass, mass gain, circulating baseline and stress-induced Cort. Additionally, we investigated the effect of genetic background and food availability on yolk hormone concentrations by subjecting grey partridge hens of two strains (wild and domesticated) to two different feeding regimes (predictable vs. unpredictable feeding) during egg laying. We hypothesized that egg hormone concentrations change over the season, but breeding in captivity over many generations and ad libitum food access could have resulted in domestication effects which abolished potential seasonal effects. Results showed that progressing season had a strong positive effect on yolk Prog and yolk Testo, but not on yolk Cort. Feeding regimes and strain had no effect on yolk hormones. Offspring mass and mass gain increased and baseline Cort decreased with progressing season. In addition, yolk Testo correlated positively with offspring mass gain and negatively with baseline Cort, while yolk Prog had a positive correlation with baseline Cort. Strain and feeding regimes of the mother had no effect on offspring traits. In conclusion, grey partridge chicks hatching late in the season might benefit from the increased concentrations of the growth-stimulating yolk Testo and by this catch-up in development. Hence, yolk hormone concentration could adaptively shape the offspring phenotype in a precocial species.  2019 Elsevier Inc."

The developing gonads are an important source of estradiol but most, if not all, vertebrate embryos are also exposed to maternally derived estradiol during development. In birds, this maternally derived estradiol is present in the egg at the time of oviposition but very little is known about how this source of estradiol influences development. A critical aspect of understanding yolk estradiol effects is deciphering how steroid metabolism may regulate embryonic exposure to yolk estradiol. In this study, we examine the metabolic fate of estradiol during the first five days of incubation in chicken (Gallus gallus) eggs. Using tritiated estradiol to trace the movement and metabolism of estradiol, we demonstrate that estradiol is metabolized to estrone, which is subsequently conjugated to estrone sulfate as the primary metabolite. Estrone sulfate then accumulates in the albumen by day five of incubation. Overall, these findings have important implications for how yolk estradiol may influence development and alter offspring phenotype. Mechanisms through which estradiol, as well as estrone sulfate, might elicit effects are discussed.  2019 Elsevier Inc."

The Zk birds coped better with situations requiring swiftness and initiative. The Pb chicks were slower than Zk and Lg and did not make quick decisions. Hence, a lower number of these birds entering and leaving the test cage and staying inside was recorded. The Zk chicks exhibited a higher level of fearfulness than the other breeds.

Here, we test the hypothesis that in hot conditions, skews in egg size across the laying sequence may be more pronounced, as females use egg size to compensate for hatching asynchrony, providing a higher level of provisioning to the later laid eggs that would hatch later due to ambient incubation. We have focused on the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata, a species that typically breeds over an extended period of the year, and therefore across a particularly wide range of ambient temperatures. We characterised the variation in egg size using data from over 700 clutches, including historical specimens, a wild population, and both domesticated and wild birds breeding in captivity, in addition to clutches produced experimentally in controlled-temperature rooms. Here, we document significant variation in egg size between and within clutches, with eggs increasing in size over the laying order, with both maternal identity and population differences playing an important role (domesticated birds laid eggs that were much larger than their wild counterparts). However, we found no support for the idea that variation in egg size either within a clutch, and across clutches and populations, is related to variation in ambient temperature, despite the large range of thermal environments experienced during laying.

Animals exposed to suboptimal conditions during development can experience physiological trade-offs, leading to seemingly negative phenotypic changes in later life that have been hypothesised to have detrimental effects on fitness. However, few studies have investigated how exposure to suboptimal developmental conditions affects an animals reproductive behavior and fitness. Here, we determine if elevated levels of corticosterone (CORT; the dominant avian stress hormone) during development affect fitness via changes in reproductive investment in adult zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). To do this, we exposed nestling zebra finches to either CORT supplemented or control treatments and assessed their mate selection and reproductive investment as adults, using free choice breeding experiments. We found that breeding pairs of birds from matched developmental treatments (CORT or control) had a shorter latency to lay clutches compared to pairs with mismatched developmental treatments. We found no indication that clutch size or egg mass were affected by developmental treatment. Also, we found no evidence that birds choose mates to match their own developmental treatment. Our results demonstrate that developmental experience may affect reproductive investment through changes to reproductive timing and add to the literature suggesting that pairs with similar developmental backgrounds can coordinate their reproduction more effectively. Significance statement: Developmental stress may reduce the fitness of a breeding pair as a result of its detrimental effect on phenotype and performance. Alternatively, individuals could use indicators of developmental stress to influence mate choice in order to compensate for a poor start to life. Previous studies suggest that birds do assortatively mate by developmental environment, but this has not been tested in a free choice mating context. Using a free choice breeding experiment, we show that pairs of breeding birds lay eggs faster when they have matching developmental environments, regardless of the quality of their developmental environment. This evidence suggests that assortatively mated pairs can potentially offset a bad start to life and maintain fitness in spite of the deleterious effects of developmental stress.  2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Meanwhile, maternal CLA dietary decreased the mRNA expression level of malic enzyme, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthetase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) (P < 0.05), and increased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1) (P < 0.05) in the embryonic liver on day 14 and 21. In addition, the protein expression level of phospho-ACC1, phospho-PPAR and CPT1 were increased by maternal CLA dietary (P < 0.05), and the protein expression of phospho-SREBP-1c was inhibited (P < 0.05), indicating that maternal CLA dietary reduced fatty acid (FA) synthesis and accelerated FA catabolism. Soybean oil addition diminished CLA-mediated fatty acid catabolism, via increasing the gene and protein expression of fatty acid synthesis (ME, SREBP-1c, FAS, ACC1) (Linear, P < 0.05) but decreasing that of fatty acid lipolysis (PPAR and CPT1) (Linear, P < 0.05).

Variation in parental genetic effects for offspring performance is expected to arise from among-parent genetic variation in parental care. Therefore, we used the animal model to predict maternal breeding values for lamb growth and used these predictions to select females for field observation, where maternal and lamb behaviors were recorded. Higher predicted maternal breeding value for lamb growth was associated with greater suckling success, but not with any other measures of suckling behavior. Though our work cannot explicitly estimate the genetic basis of the specific traits involved, it does provide a strategy for hypothesis generation and refinement that we hope could be used to justify data collection costs needed for confirmatory studies. Here, results suggest that behavioral genetic variation is involved in generating maternal genetic effects on lamb growth in Soay sheep. Though important caveats and cautions apply, our approach may extend the ability to initiate more genetic investigations of difficult-to-study behaviors and social interactions in natural populations.  2019 The Author(s) 2019.

American coot babies are among the most ornamented offspring found in nature, sporting vividly orange-red natal plumage, a bright red beak, and other red parts around the face and pate. Previous plumage manipulation experiments showed that ornamented plumage is favored by strong parental choice for chicks with more extreme ornamentation but left unresolved the question as to why parents show the preference. Here we explore natural patterns of variation in coot chick plumage color, both within and between families, to understand the context of parental preference and to determine whose fitness interests are served by the ornamentation. Conspecific brood parasitism is common in coots and brood parasitic chicks could manipulate hosts by tapping into parental choice for ornamented chicks. However, counter to expectation, parasitic chicks were duller (less red) than nonparasitic chicks. This pattern is explained by color variation within families: Chick coloration increases with position in the egg-laying order, but parasitic eggs are usually the first eggs a female lays. Maternal effects influence chick coloration, but coot females do not use this mechanism to benefit the chicks they lay as parasites. However, within families, chick coloration predicts whether chicks become ""favorites"" when parents begin control over food distribution, implicating a role for the chick ornamentation in the parental lifehistory strategy, perhaps as a reliable signal of a chick's size or age.  2020 National Academy of Sciences.

Although testosterone was thought to be a key mediator of maternal effects in birds, we now know that vertebrate embryos actively regulate their exposure to maternal testosterone through steroid metabolism, suggesting testosterone metabolites, not testosterone, may elicit the observed phenotypic effects. To address the role steroid metabolism plays in mediating yolk testosterone effects, we used European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) eggs to characterize the timing of testosterone metabolism and determine whether etiocholanolone, a prominent metabolite of testosterone in avian embryos, is capable of affecting early embryonic development. Tritiated testosterone was injected into freshly laid eggs to characterize steroid movement and metabolism during early development. Varying levels of etiocholanolone were also injected into eggs, with incubation for either 3 or 5 days, to test whether etiocholanolone influences the early growth of embryonic tissues. The conversion of testosterone to etiocholanolone was initiated within 12 h of injection, but the increase in etiocholanolone was transient, indicating that etiocholanolone is also subject to metabolism, and that exposure to maternal etiocholanolone is limited to a short period during early development. Exogenous etiocholanolone manipulation had no significant effect on the growth rate of the embryos or extraembryonic membranes early in development. Thus, the conversion of testosterone to etiocholanolone may be an inactivation pathway that buffers the embryo from maternal steroids, with any effects of yolk testosterone resulting from testosterone that escapes metabolism; alternatively, etiocholanolone may influence processes other than growth or take additional time to manifest.  2020.

However, recent evidence indicates that maternal GCs may adaptively programme particular physiological and molecular pathways during development to enhance offspring fitness. In this context, an important mechanism through which maternal GCs may lastingly affect offspring phenotypic quality and survival is via effects on embryo telomerase activity and so on offspring postnatal telomere length. Here, using a field experimental design for which we manipulated the corticosterone content in yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) eggs, we show that embryos from corticosterone-injected eggs not only had a higher telomerase activity but also longer telomeres just after hatching. A complementary analysis further revealed that gull hatchlings with longer telomeres had a higher survival probability during the period when most of the chick mortality occurs. Given the important role that telomere length and its restoring mechanisms have on ageing trajectories and disease risk, our findings provide a new mechanistic link by which mothers may presumably shape offspring life-history trajectories and phenotype.  2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

Perceived predation risk can affect both parent and offspring phenotype, but it remains unclear to what extent offspring behavioral traits are affected when the mother is exposed to predation risk. This is particularly unclear in live-bearing species where maternal effects could occur during embryogenesis. Here, using a half-sib design to control for paternal effects, we experimentally exposed females of a live-bearing fish, the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), to visual predator cues and conspecific alarm cues during their gestation. Females exposed to predation risk cues increased their antipredator behaviors throughout the entire treatment. Offspring of mothers exposed to the predation stimuli exhibited more pronounced exploratory behavior, but did not show any significant differences in their schooling behavior, compared to controls. Thus, while maternally perceived risk affected offspring's exploration during early stages of life, offspring's schooling behavior could be influenced more by direct environmental experience rather than via maternal cues. Our results suggest a rather limited role in predator-induced maternal effects on the behavior of juvenile guppies.  The Author(s) 2020.

It has often been argued that these phenotypic responses could be the result of micro-evolutionary changes following the urbanization process. However, other mechanisms such as phenotypic plasticity, maternal effects, and developmental plasticity could be involved as well. To address maternal effects as potential mechanisms, we compared maternal hormone and antibody concentrations in eggs between city and forest populations of European blackbirds (Turdus merula), a widely distributed species for which previous research demonstrated differences in behavioral and physiological traits. We measured egg and yolk mass, yolk concentrations of androgens (androstenedione [A4], testosterone [T], 5-dihydrotestosterone [5-DHT], and immunoglobulins [IgY]) and related them to population, clutch size, laying order, embryo sex, and progress of breeding season. We show (a) earlier onset of laying in the city than forest population, but similar egg and clutch size; (b) higher overall yolk androgen concentrations in the forest than the city population (sex-dependent for T); (c) greater among-female variation of yolk T and 5-DHT concentrations in the forest than city population, but similar within-clutch variation; (d) similar IgY concentrations with a seasonal decline in both populations; and (e) population-specific positive (city) or negative (forest) association of yolk A4 and T with IgY concentrations. Our results are consistent with the hypotheses that hormone-mediated maternal effects contribute to differences in behavioral and physiological traits between city and forest individuals and that yolk androgen and immunoglobulin levels can exhibit population-specific relationships rather than trade-off against each other.  2020 The Authors.

While both a direct and a maternal effect were seen on body weight, breast muscle weight and abdominal fat weight in the F1 generation, the direct effect was the most dominant one. The liver transcriptome in the F1 generation showed that amino acid metabolism was upregulated in chickens that received control feed when compared to their respective contemporaries that received the reduced protein diet. Interestingly, chickens hatched from control fed hens but reared on reduced protein diet (C/RP group) activated a fatty acid metabolism, expressing more FADS1, FADS2 and ELOVL2, when compared to control fed chickens hatched from control fed hens (C/C group), while chickens hatched from reduced protein fed hens that received themselves the same reduced protein diet (RP/RP group) triggered their glucose metabolism more, showing elevated levels of PFKL, PFKFB4 and ALDOC mRNA compared to the chickens hatched from reduced protein fed hens but reared on a control diet (RP/C group).

Inmany reptiles, for example, egg incubation temperature permanently determines offspring sex (temperature-dependent sex determination, TSD) and also influences a suite of morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits. Thus, the contributions of sex and incubation temperature to phenotypic variation are difficult to identify because these factors are confounded under TSD. We used chemical manipulations to experimentally decouple gonadal sex and incubation temperature in a turtle with TSD (Chrysemys picta) to examine their relative and interactive effects on variation in incubation duration and offspring size. We show that warm incubation temperature accelerates development as expected and that exogenous estradiol treatment to eggs further shortens incubation duration across all incubation temperatures. Moreover, estradiol unexpectedly induced male development, resulting in male offspring hatching sooner than female offspring. Variation in offspring size was also influenced by incubation temperature and gonadal sex, but interactions between these two variables were relatively small or nonsignificant. The fitness consequences of these effects are unknown, but we provide preliminary results from our attempts at examining the long-term and sex-specific effects of incubation temperature. Manipulative experimental approaches, combined with longer-term experiments that track individuals through reproduction, will provide novel insights into the adaptive significance of developmental plasticity in long-lived organisms.  2019 by The University of Chicago."

Although these roles have been examined independently in detail in adult fishes, less attention has been paid to the effects of an endogenous stress response during early life, particularly with respect to its potential effects on ionic/osmotic balance. The present study tested the hypothesis that exposure of zebrafish to stress during early development would alter ion balance later in life. Zebrafish at three developmental stages (4, 7, or 15days post-fertilization, dpf) were subjected to an air-exposure stressor twice a day for 2days, causing elevation of whole-body cortisol levels. Individuals stressed early in life exhibited decreased survival and growth, altered cortisol responses to a subsequent air-exposure stressor, and increased whole-body Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations. Changes in whole-body Ca2+ concentrations were accompanied by increased ionocyte abundance at 7 dpf and increased rates of Ca2+ uptake from the environment. Differences in whole-body ion concentrations at 15 and 35 dpf were not accompanied by altered ion uptake rates. Across all ages examined, air-exposure stress experienced at 7 dpf was particularly effective at eliciting phenotypic changes, suggesting a critical window at this age for a stress response to influence development. These findings demonstrate that early-life stress in zebrafish triggers developmental plasticity, with age-dependent effects on both the cortisol stress axis and ion balance.  2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

However, the roles of offspring sex-specific sensitivity to maternal glucocorticoids and sex-biased maternal investment remain unclear. It is also uncertain whether telomere length (a marker associated with lifespan) depends on early growth in a sex-specific manner. We assessed whether maternal traits including corticosterone (CORT; the main avian glucocorticoid) and in ovo growth rate are sex-specifically related to offspring CORT exposure, relative telomere length (RTL) and body condition in eiders (Somateria mollissima). We measured feather CORT (fCORT), RTL and body condition of newly hatched ducklings, and growth rate in ovo was expressed as tarsus length at hatching per incubation duration. Maternal traits included baseline plasma CORT, RTL, body condition and breeding experience. We found that fCORT was negatively associated with growth rate in daughters, while it showed a positive association in sons. Lower offspring fCORT was associated with higher maternal baseline plasma CORT, and fCORT was higher in larger clutches and in those hatching later. The RTL of daughters was negatively associated with maternal RTL, whereas that of males was nearly independent of maternal RTL. Higher fCORT in ovo was associated with longer RTL at hatching in both sexes. Duckling body condition was mainly explained by egg weight, and sons had a slightly lower body condition. Our correlational results suggest that maternal effects may have heterogeneous and even diametrically opposed effects between the sexes during early development. Our findings also challenge the view that prenatal CORT exposure is invariably associated with shorter telomeres.  2019, The Author(s)."

The adaptive nature of female ornaments is now widely accepted. After a rapid overview of this shift, we present the results of comparative studies focused on identifying the forces involved in the evolution of female coloration in birds. We then discuss the results of intraspecific ornithological field studies and finish up by summarizing the work done by our group and others on female coloration in blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus). Overall, this review confirms that female coloration traits function as ornaments and/or badges of status in many bird species. It also identifies several mechanisms that can circumvent trade-offs in investment between coloration traits and egg production. Based on this review, we call for further research on certain topics and specific changes in practices. More precisely, at the macroevolutionary level, we should avoid framing our questions around sexual dichromatism and male-centered proxies of sexual selection if we wish to elucidate the female-specific selective forces and constraints involved in the evolution of female coloration. At the microevolutionary level, we need to quantify social and sexual selection in both sexes, and to perform experimental studies to compare the selective forces acting on female and male coloration. In particular, it appears important to investigate how maternal effects and physiological drivers of aggressiveness relate to female coloration. Finally, our work on blue tits illustrates the importance of conducting long-term studies in tandem with replicated experiments within a given species.  2020 Elsevier Inc."

It provides population sex ratios that will maximise the sustainability of the population under incipient environmental conditions. Environmental factors responsible for sex determination include temperature, photoperiod, food availability, and population density. These cues stimulate the release of chemical signalling molecules (i.e. hormones) that determine the sex of newborns. We have analysed the responses of three Daphnia pulex clones (I, K, and S), isolated from different natural populations, to juvenile hormone methyl farnesoate (MF) in terms of survivorship, fecundity, production of males and ephippia, and expression of genes involved in sex determination (dsx1) and hormonal regulation (JHAMT, Met, RXR). Clonal individuals were exposed to: (1) high MF concentration (0.8M) combined with stressful conditions; (2) low MF concentration (0.15M) combined with optimal conditions of population density and food availability in two subsequent generations. The genetically different clones of D. pulex differed in the propensity for male and ephippia production and in the sensitivity to the stimuli that lead to the switch from parthenogenetic to sexual reproduction. A significant induction of male production was observed in all three clones when exposed to MF. In conditions mimicking crowding, only clone S produced male offspring even in absence of MF and showed higher expression levels of JHAMT and dsx1 genes. This response suggests that clone S has a high propensity to produce males probably due to a high sensitivity of receptors to environmental stimuli activating the endogenous biosynthesis of MF. However, clone S exposed to high MF concentration produced fewer males than clones I and K, which generally have a low natural propensity to produce males. High MF concentration coupled with conditions mimicking crowding, probably activated a feedback mechanism in clone S via the differential modulation of genes involved in the synthesis as well in the degradation of MF. Exposure to low MF concentration for two subsequent generations resulted in a reduction of male progeny production from the first (G1) to the second (G2) generation. All analysed genes were up-regulated in both generations treated with MF, but with lower expression in G2. The reduced up-regulation of the dsx1 gene matched with the lower male production. Based on our results and literature data, we hypothesised that the maternal dsx1 mRNA probably plays some role early in oocyte development, and causes the eggs that receive the dsx1 signal to develop into males. Exposure to MF for two generations significantly increased ephippia production. These results suggest that the induction of male and ephippia might have a common root in the MF pathway. The effect of MF on life-history traits (delay in the age at maturity and fecundity reduction), sex ratio, and ephippia production suggests a direct impact of the juvenile hormone on the level of population growth. Thus, as a consequence of the switch from parthenogenetic to sexual reproduction, MF influences Daphnia population metrics and in this way probably maximises the sustainability of the population under variable environmental conditions.  2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Sex allocation can be adjusted by controlling offspring sex ratio or by sex-specific resource allocation towards individual eggs. The latter is well-known in birds and reptiles, but less studied in other organisms, especially haplodiploids with females that can adjust offspring sex via fertilization control. Here, we investigated whether egg size can affect sex allocation in a haplodiploid thrips, Pezothrips kellyanus. First, we established that larger eggs are more likely to be fertilized and become females than smaller eggs, which remain unfertilized and become males. This size-dependent fertilization may be regulated by anatomical constraints that allow sperm access only to larger eggs. Furthermore, across both sexes, larger eggs developed into offspring with higher fitness, suggesting that egg size is a reliable proxy for resource allocation in this species. During the early phase of reproduction, mating increased investment by females towards egg size thereby facilitating fertilization success and increased female offspring survival. However, this came with a reduced lifetime fecundity, reflecting that mating manipulates reproductive strategies in favour of increased daughter production. This may be in conflict with the optimal offspring sex ratio of females which is theoretically less female-biased than for males. We detected both egg size-mediated sex allocation and a mating effect on resource allocation under both laboratory and field conditions, suggesting that they are maintained by natural selection. We provide evidence for a finely tuned egg size-dependent fertilization mechanism that mediates sex allocation strategies and is moderated by mating. Furthermore, our findings establish a new perspective about potential effects of sexual conflicts on egg size and sex allocation.

The PFAAs averaged 57.4 ng/g wet weight, ranging between 26.5 and 115.0 ng/g wet weight. The PFAA levels varied substantially among clutches (0.290.79 of the total variation), whereas the effects of laying order were considerably weaker (0.010.13). Egg-laying order effects were detected for PFAAs, PFOS, perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnA), and PFDoDa, whereby the last-laid eggs exhibited lower PFAA concentrations than early-laid eggs. Our results indicate that seagulls from the northern Adriatic basin deposit measurable amounts of PFAAs in their eggs. The large among-clutches differences in PFAAs suggest that exposure of yellow-legged gull females to these compounds is highly variable. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:110.  2020 SETAC.  2020 SETAC"

Since the reemergence of this field in the 1970s, we learned that left-right differences of brain and behavior exist throughout the animal kingdom and pay off in terms of sensory, cognitive, and motor efficiency. Ontogenetically, lateralization starts in many species with asymmetrical expression patterns of genes within the Nodal cascade that set up the scene for later complex interactions of genetic, environmental, and epigenetic factors. These take effect during different time points of ontogeny and create asymmetries of neural networks in diverse species. As a result, depending on task demands, left-or right-hemispheric loops of feedforward or feedback projections are then activated and can tempo-rarily dominate a neural process. In addition, asymmetries of commissural transfer can shape lateralized processes in each hemisphere. It is still unclear if interhemispheric interactions depend on an inhibition/excitation dichotomy or instead adjust the contralateral temporal neural structure to delay the other hemisphere or synchronize with it during joint action. As outlined in our review, novel animal models and approaches could be established in the last decades, and they already produced a substantial increase of knowledge. Since there is practically no realm of human perception, cognition, emotion, or action that is not affected by our lateralized neural organization, insights from these comparative studies are crucial to understand the functions and pathologies of our asymmetric brain.  2020, American Physiological Society.

Such maternal effects can be expected to be shaped by natural selection, given the costs connected to the allocation of maternal resources. Among egg components, yolk androgens play an important role in affecting offspring life-history traits. Despite their relevance for nestling development, factors accounting for the observed within- and between-clutch variation are still poorly known. By using a cross-sectional sampling approach, we tested the effect of female age, laying order and laying date on the deposition of yolk androstenedione (A4) and testosterone (T), since young and older females could maximize their fitness differently according to breeding conditions. We found a remarkable lack of differences in overall yolk androgen levels across different ages. However, comparing first-year with older females, our results showed that age did not influence yolk T levels at the beginning of the breeding season, whereas at the end, first-year females transferred lower hormone levels than older females. Within clutches, both androgens increased across the laying sequence, suggesting that late nestlings benefit from an increased allocation that could compensate hatching asynchrony. However, when considering A4, we found that, whereas older females always increased A4 levels across the laying sequence, first-year females did not increase it at the end of the breeding season, thus increasing the likelihood of brood reduction when environmental conditions became hardest. These findings suggest that yolk A4 variation may be particularly important at the within-clutch scale, by providing females with a tool to modify nestling hierarchies. Significance statement: The study of maternal effects shows that avian mothers can adjust offspring development to environmental conditions by altering egg composition. The effects of maternal age on such egg allocation process depend on the balance of benefits and costs that affects each age class. We examine if young and older mothers differ in terms of yolk androgen deposition and egg quality, since age may influence offspring fitness, and could represent a costly maternal investment. We found an absence of overall age-dependent patterns in yolk androgen deposition, except when we considered laying order and laying date. In late clutches, when breeding conditions are harsher, 1-year-old females carried out a lower deposition of both resources (yolk mass) and modifiers (androgens) than older mothers did. We suggest that such a pattern would reinforce the effects of hatching asynchrony, favouring brood reduction at the end of the breeding season by first-year females.  2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Yet, there is a severe lack of understanding of how and when these effects are actually mediated, hampering both underlying proximate and ultimate explanations. Here we report a novel finding that the embryo expresses androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor (ER) mRNA in its extraembryonic membranes (EMs) as early as before its own hormone production starts, suggesting a novel substrate for action of maternal hormones on the offspring. We also report the first experimental evidence for steroid receptor regulation in the avian embryo in response to yolk steroid levels: the level of AR is dependent on yolk androgen levels only in the EMs but not in body tissues, suggesting embryonic adaptation to maternal hormones. The results also solve the problem of uptake of lipophilic steroids from the yolk, why they affect multiple traits, and how they could mediate maternal effects without affecting embryonic sexual differentiation.  2019, The Author(s)."

Subsequently, we artificially inseminated females with either testosterone enriched (TE) or control ejaculates (CE) in a cross-over design. TE females produced heavier eggs than CE females. Offspring growth and tonic immobility were affected in a sex-specific way by TE. TE sons were heavier with shorter TI duration than CE sons, and TE daughters were lighter than CE daughters but daughters did not differ in TI score. However, the chicks competitiveness was not influenced by the TE nor CE.

Here we describe the blue tit egg albumen and yolk proteomes and evaluate their potential to mediate maternal effects. We show that variation in egg composition (proteins, lipids, carotenoids) primarily depends on laying order and female age. Egg proteomic profiles are mainly driven by laying order, and investment in the egg proteome is functionally biased among eggs. Our results suggest that maternal effects on egg composition result from both passive and active (partly compensatory) mechanisms, and that variation in egg composition creates diverse biochemical environments for embryonic development.  2019, The Author(s)."

Newly-developed imaging protocols provide an unprecedented view of vesicular dynamics near the plasma membrane in mouse eggs. We discover that cortical granule anchoring in the cortex is dependent on maternal MATER and document that myosin IIA is required for biphasic trafficking to the plasma membrane. We observe local clearance of cortical actin during exocytosis and determine that pharmacologic or genetic disruption of trafficking to the plasma membrane impairs secretion of cortical granules and results in polyspermy. Thus, the regulation of cortical granule dynamics at the cortex-plasma membrane interface is critical for exocytosis and the post-fertilization block to sperm binding that ensures monospermic fertilization.  2019, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply 2019."

Here, we investigated how this procedure affects the chickens in a short- as well as long-term perspective by conducting two behaviour tests and measuring corticosterone (CORT) and sex hormone levels at different time points. These results were compared with a group of control chickens from the same hatchery and incubator that did not go through the commercial hatchery routine. Chickens were continuously weighed, egg production data was collected and feather scoring was performed. We found that chicks have a significant increase in CORT during the hatchery process, which implies they are exposed to stress. During first weeks of life, these chicks were more fearful, had a higher CORT reactivity during restraint and weighed more than control chicks. Later in life, hatchery treated chickens had more feather damages and injuries on combs and wattles, a faster onset of egg laying and higher levels of estradiol. We conclude that processing at the commercial hatchery was a stressful event with short- and long-term effects on behaviour and stress reactivity, and potentially also positive effects on production. The results are relevant for a large number of individuals, since the chicken is by far the globally most common farm animal.  2019, The Author(s)."

For example, predator presence can increase stress hormone levels, which can have physiological costs. Stress exposure accelerates the shortening of telomeres (i.e. the protective caps of chromosomes) and shorter telomeres have been linked to increased mortality risk. However, the effect of perceived predation risk on telomeres is not known. We investigated the effects of continuous predator threat (nesting Eurasian pygmy owl Glaucidium passerinum) on telomere dynamics of both adult and partially cross-fostered nestling pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) in the wild. Females nesting at owl-inhabited sites showed impaired telomere maintenance between incubation and chick rearing compared to controls, and both males and females ended up with shorter telomeres at owl-inhabited sites in the end of chick rearing. On the contrary, both original and cross-fostered chicks reared in owl sites had consistently longer telomeres during growth than chicks reared at control sites. Thus, predation risk may cause a long-term cost in terms of telomeres for parents but not for their offspring. Predators may therefore affect telomere dynamics of their preys, which could have implications for their ageing rate and consequently for population dynamics.  2019, The Author(s)."

Variation in environmental conditions experienced by gestating mothers (viz. nongenetic maternal effects) is known to have significant impact on offspring condition and behavior; yet, their effect on behavioral consistency is not clear. Here, by applying an orthogonal experimental design, we aimed to study whether increased vitamin D3 content in maternal diet during gestation (vitamin-supplemented vs. vitamin control treatments) combined with corticosterone treatment (corticosterone-treated vs. corticosterone control treatments) applied on freshly hatched juveniles had an effect on individual state and behavioral consistency of juvenile Carpetan rock lizards (Iberolacerta cyreni). We tested the effect of our treatments on (a) climbing speed and the following levels of behavioral variation, (b) strength of animal personality (behavioral repeatability), (c) behavioral type (individual mean behavior), and (d) behavioral predictability (within-individual behavioral variation unrelated to environmental change). We found higher locomotor performance of juveniles from the vitamin-supplemented group (42.4% increase), irrespective of corticosterone treatment. While activity personality was present in all treatments, shelter use personality was present only in the vitamin-supplementedcorticosterone-treated treatment and risk-taking personality was present in corticosterone control treatments. Contrary to our expectations, behavioral type was not affected by our treatments, indicating that individual quality can affect behavioral strategies without affecting group-level mean behavior. Behavioral predictability decreased in individuals with low climbing speed, which could be interpreted as a form of antipredator strategy. Our results clearly demonstrate that maternal diet and corticosterone treatment have the potential to induce or hamper between-individual variation in different components of boldness, often in interactions.  2019 The Authors.

We previously characterized a biphasic effect of these reagents on Ca2+-triggered exocytosis: low doses potentiated Ca2+ sensitivity, whereas high doses inhibited Ca2+ sensitivity and extent of vesicle fusion. Capitalizing on this novel potentiating effect, we have now identified fluorescent thiol-reactive reagents producing the same effects: Lucifer yellow iodoacetamide, monobromobimane, and dibromobimane. Top-down proteomic analyses of fluorescently labeled proteins from total and cholesterol-enriched vesicle membrane fractions using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry identified several candidate targets, some of which have been previously linked to the late steps of regulated exocytosis and some of which are novel. Initial validation studies indicate that Rab proteins are involved in the modulation of Ca2+ sensitivity, and thus the efficiency of membrane fusion, which may, in part, be linked to their previously identified upstream roles in vesicle docking.  2019 by the authors."

The neuronal mechanisms underlying this behavior are mostly unknown. However, it has been hypothesized that innate social predispositions may involve subpallial brain areas including the amygdala. Here we asked whether a stuffed hen would activate areas of the arcopallium/amygdala complex, in particular the nucleus taeniae of the amygdala (TnA) or septum. We measured brain activity by visualizing the immediate early gene product c-Fos. After exposure to the hen, TnA showed higher density of c-Fos expressing neurons, compared to chicks that were exposed to the scrambled stimulus. A similar trend was present in the lower portion of the arcopallium, but not in the upper portion of the arcopallium or in the septum. This demonstrates that at birth the TnA is already engaged in responses to social visual stimuli, suggesting an important role for this nucleus in the early ontogenetic development of social behavior.  2019, The Author(s)."

We also found that brighter males invest less in their offspring (by delivering less food to their nestlings and poorly cleaning the nest) than duller males and, by contrast, females mated with brighter males invest more in parental care. Our results are consistent with the differential allocation hypothesis: differential allocation allowed breeding pairs with brighter males to produce more offspring, suggesting that it can be considered adaptive and should be included in studies of eco-evolutionary dynamics.  2019, The Author(s)."

Rates and trajectories of embryonic development are highly sensitive to temperature, favouring an ability of embryos to respond adaptively (i.e. match their developmental biology to local thermal regimes). Spatially, thermal variation can be significant within a single nest (top to bottom), among adjacent nests (as a function of shading, nest depth etc.), across populations that inhabit areas with different weather conditions, and across species that differ in climates occupied and/or nest characteristics. Thermal regimes also vary temporally, in ways that generate differences among nests within a single population (e.g. due to seasonal timing of laying), among populations and across species.Anthropogenic activities (e.g. habitat clearing, climate change) add to this spatial and temporal diversity in thermal regimes. We review published literature on embryonic adaptations to spatio-temporal heterogeneity in nest temperatures. Although relatively few taxa have been studied in detail, and proximate mechanisms remain unclear, our review identifies many cases in which natural selection appears to have fine-tuned embryogenesis to match local thermal regimes. Developmental rates have been reported to differ between uppermost versus lower eggs within a single nest, between eggs laid early versus late in the season, and between populations from cooler versus warmer climates.

Higher body growth rate is often connected with a weakened immune system.

The trial evaluated the maternal investment to immunologically active substances, cell-mediated immunity stimulated by phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) injection and the acute phase of the immune response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration in three different phases of early postnatal growth. 4. Except for higher lysozyme activity in the LG group when compared to the HG line, the maternal investment did not differ between the two lines. Plasma antibody concentrations responded quickly to any change in growth rate in both lines.

While studies usually explore how females can increase their reproductive success through an allocation of yolk testosterone (T) under external environmental variability, it is less clear whether intrinsically driven interfemale differences in yolk T deposition may themselves predict female reproductive decisions. In our study, we used Japanese quail, Coturnix japonica, lines divergently selected for high (HET) and low (LET) egg T concentrations to examine whether this genetic variation in yolk T levels is linked to female mating decisions. First, we analysed line differences in male-typical reproductive behaviour and how this behavioural response is affected by female line identity. Males were tested with females from the same (match pairs) and opposite (cross pairs) lines. Next, female mate preferences were evaluated in a two-choice test in which females were allowed to choose between males from the same and opposite lines. We found no line differences in male copulatory behaviour. Interestingly, a shorter latency to copulate and a higher number of copulations were recorded in LET males when they were mated with HET than LET females. No differences between match and cross pairs were found in HET males. In the two-choice test, LET females displayed a preference for males from the same over the opposite line, but HET females did not discriminate between LET and HET males. Collectively, these results demonstrate that genetically high yolk T deposition is related to higher receptivity and reduced choosiness in female mate preferences in Japanese quail. Moreover, our results indicate an important link between maternal investment, reproductive physiology and female mating decisions, pointing out evolutionary implications and a role of variation in female mate choice in sexual selection.  2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour"

We measured righting response, an indicator of behavioral type, of juvenile red-eared slider turtles (Trachemys scripta) emerging from early and late season clutches to understand if the production of behavioral types differs across the nesting season. There was a significant effect of season, with early season hatchlings righting more quickly than late season hatchlings, and we explored two potential underlying mechanisms, maternal estrogens and maternal investment (e.g., yolk allocation). We dosed early season eggs with an estrogen mixture to mimic late season eggs and assayed hatchling righting response, but found no significant effect of this maternal effect. We assessed maternal investment by measuring egg, hatchling, and residual yolk masses. We found a seasonal pattern in yolk allocation, where early season eggs have more yolk than late season eggs. Early season hatchlings used more yolk for growth rather than maintenance of existing tissues, resulting in larger hatchlings. Interestingly, across both seasons, hatchlings that received less maternal yolk appeared to be more efficient at converting yolk to tissue, but we found no direct correlation with righting behavior. We demonstrate that the prevalence of behavioral types varies across the nesting season, creating correlated suites of seasonal phenotypes in turtle hatchlings, but it appears that neither maternal estrogens or investment in yolk directly underlie this shift in behavior.  2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc"

Lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, are a regionally threatened fish species that experience high predation rates during larval stages. To investigate effects of a high temperature stressor, we exposed lake sturgeon eggs from four families to 10 C (low-stress) or 18 C (high-stress) rearing temperatures. At egg, free embryo and larval stages, we quantified stress levels for individuals from each treatment using whole-body cortisol analysis at baseline and after an acute stressor. At the larval stage, we videorecorded behaviour trials to quantify swimming activity, and we conducted predation trials to quantify survival outcomes for individuals from high-stress and low-stress temperature treatments. Free embryos reared at 18 C had a significantly smaller cortisol response after exposure to an acute stressor, indicating that chronic high temperature stress may reduce stress reactivity in lake sturgeon. In addition, larvae reared at 18 C had significantly higher activity levels during behaviour trials and significantly higher survival rates when exposed to crayfish predation, indicating that behavioural alterations induced by early life stress may be adaptive in high-stress contexts such as predation. These findings illustrate the need to experimentally evaluate fitness effects of stressors within ecologically relevant contexts in order to predict population- and community-level outcomes of climate change.  2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour"

Changes in immunocompetence arising from variation in landcover may provide important links between habitat changes and patterns of disease spread. To establish a baseline understanding for whether immune measures covary with changes in landcover, we examined associations between immunological parameters and landcover composition for adults and nestlings of five shrubland bird species. Specifically, we examined the bacteria-killing ability (BKA) of the blood plasma and profiles of the five avian leukocytes as our measures of immune function, and assessed the proportion of area around each bird's nest that was composed of the four major landcover types in the Midwestern USA: row crop agriculture, developed, forest, and grass/shrub. We performed landcover assessments at 100 and 1000 m radius buffers to identify whether associations between habitat and immune function differed at the two spatial scales. As part of this work, we examined age and species-related immunological variation, as well as associations among the immune parameters. There was little evidence linking variation in immune function to landcover composition for the adults at either spatial scale, but there were numerous associations for nestlings, and these were stronger at the 1000 than 100 m spatial scale. The proportion of grass/shrub around the nest had the largest impact on immune function, although the effect varied by immune parameter and species. BKA and basophils were inversely associated with grass/shrub for all species, whereas lymphocytes were positively associated with grass/shrub for all species. We also documented species-level differences among adults and nestlings for BKA and all leukocytes except monocytes. As expected, we found that nestlings had reduced levels of BKA, lymphocytes, monocytes, and elevated heterophils compared with adults (except for field sparrow-Spizella pusilla-nestlings, which had higher lymphocytes). Basophils generally did not differ by age class, and eosinophils exhibited species-specific patterns, in which they were higher for nestling American robins (Turdus migratorius) and gray catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis) compared with adults, but lower in the other nestlings. Heterophils and lymphocytes were inversely associated for all species and age classes, and basophil levels were positively associated with BKA across species and age classes. Together, these findings bolster our understanding of age and species-specific variation in immune function, and provide evidence that immune measures can covary with changes in landcover.  2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Begging is one display commonly used by offspring to signal their nutritional state, however begging behavior has received very little attention in social insects. Theory predicts that begging can be either an honest (i.e., honest-signaling strategy) or a dishonest (i.e., scrambling competition) signal of need, with dishonest signals expected to be more likely when relatedness within the group is low. To investigate the presence and honesty of begging, as well as the nature of the involved signals, we used a comparative approach with four species of the ant genus Formica known to differ in the degree of intra-colony relatedness. We investigated the behavior of starved and non-starved larvae of F. aquilonia, F. pressilabris (both low intra-colony relatedness), F. exsecta (intermediate relatedness), and F. fusca (high relatedness). In addition, we assessed the attraction of conspecific workers toward odors extracted from these two classes of larvae and analyzed the larval cuticular hydrocarbon profiles. We found that in F. fusca and F. exsecta, larvae signaled significantly more when starved. In contrast, larvae of F. aquilonia signaled significantly more when they were non-starved, while there was no significant difference in the behavior of starved vs. non-starved larvae in F. pressilabris. Our results show that workers were not preferentially attracted to the odor of starved larvae, and we also did not detect any differences between the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of starved and non-starved larvae. Overall, this study demonstrates among species variation in larval hunger signaling in Formica ants, and encourages further studies to confirm the link between kin structure variation and the honesty of begging signals.

Because adults usually have similar-aged mates, it is difficult to separate effects of maternal and paternal age, and environmental circumstances are also likely to influence offspring outcomes. The mechanisms underlying the Lansing effect are poorly understood. Variation in telomere length and loss, particularly in early life, is linked to longevity in many vertebrates, and therefore changes in offspring telomere dynamics could be very important in this context. We examined the effect of maternal age and environment on offspring telomere length in zebra finches. We kept mothers under either control (ad libitum food) or more challenging (unpredictable food) circumstances and experimentally minimized paternal age and mate choice effects. Irrespective of the maternal environment, there was a substantial negative effect of maternal age on offspring telomere length, evident in longitudinal and cross-sectional comparisons (average of 39% shorter). Furthermore, in young mothers, sons reared by challenged mothers had significantly shorter telomere lengths than sons reared by control mothers. This effect disappeared when the mothers were old, and was absent in daughters. These findings highlight the importance of telomere dynamics as inter-generational mediators of the evolutionary processes determining optimal age-specific reproductive effort and sex allocation.  2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Despite the prevalence of progesterone during development, relatively little is known about how embryos respond to progesterone. This is true of placental vertebrates as well as egg-laying vertebrates where levels of progesterone in the yolk tend to be higher than most other steroids in the yolk. Bird eggs provide an opportunity to investigate the effects of progesterone on embryonic development because progesterone can be easily manipulated without any confounding effects on maternal physiology. To understand how progesterone might influence embryonic development, it is important to characterize the metabolic fate of progesterone given its potential to be converted to a wide range of steroids. We investigated the metabolic fate of tritiated progesterone over the first four days of development using chicken eggs (Gallus gallus) and identified 5-pregnanedione as the primary metabolite during this period. After only one day of development, 5-pregnanedione could be detected within the yolk. Levels of 5-pregnanedione in both the yolk and albumen tended to rise early in development but conjugated metabolites began to accumulate towards the end of our sampling period. Additionally, in vitro assays using embryo homogenates collected after 72 h of development demonstrated that embryos were capable of carrying out the conversion of progesterone to 5-pregnanedione. Overall these results have important implications for deciphering the mechanisms through which yolk progesterone might influence embryonic development. Effects could arise via progesterone receptors or receptors capable of binding 5-pregnanedione but we found no evidence that progesterone is serving as a precursor for androgen or estrogen production.  2019 Elsevier Inc."

The flexibility for mothers to adjust hormone transfer is therefore a prerequisite for such anticipatory maternal effects. Nevertheless, previous studies have focused only on the average differences of maternal hormone transfer between groups and neglected the substantial individual variation, despite the fact that individual plasticity in maternal hormone transfer is actually the central assumption. In this study, we studied the between-and within-individual variation of maternal thyroid hormones (THs) in egg yolk of wild great tits (Parus major) and estimated the individual plasticity of maternal yolk THs across environmental temperature, clutch initiation dates, and egg laying order using linear mixed effects models. Interestingly, our models provide statistical evidence that the two main THsthe main biologically active hormone T3 and T4, which is mostly considered a prohormoneexhibited different variation patterns. Yolk T3 showed significant between-individual variation on the average levels, in line with its previously reported moderate heritability. Yolk T4, however, showed significant between-clutch variation in the pattern over the laying sequence, suggesting a great within-individual plasticity. Our findings suggest that the role and function of the hormone within the endocrine axis likely influences its flexibility to respond to environmental change. Whether the flexibility of T4 deposition brings a fitness advantage should be examined along with its potential effects on offspring, which remain to be further investigated.  2019 by The University of Chicago.

In species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), short-term, individual developmental responses to the incubation environment have long-term consequences for populations. We took a model-based approach to study within- and among-population variation in the physiological components of TSD in 12 populations of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta). We used laboratory and field incubation data to quantify variation in thermal reaction norms at both population and clutch scales, focusing on the pivotal temperature that produces a 1:1 sex ratio (P) and the transitional range of incubation temperatures (TRTs) that produce mixed sex ratios. Defying theoretical expectations, among-population variation in P was not convincingly explained by geography or local thermal conditions. However, within some populations, P varied by '5C at the clutch scale, indicating that the temperature sensitivity of gonadal differentiation can vary substantially among individual nesting females. In addition, the TRT was wider at lower latitudes, suggesting responsiveness to local incubation conditions. Our results provide a potential explanation for discrepancies observed between constant-temperature experimental results and outcomes of fluctuating incubation conditions experienced in natural nests, exposing important knowledge gaps in our understanding of local adaptation in TSD and identifying shortcomings of traditional laboratory studies. Understanding individual variation and the timing of gonadal differentiation is likely to be far more useful in understanding local adaptation than previously acknowledged.

So far, the ultimate causes of breeding density remain contentious, owing to the logistic challenges in both obtaining and interpreting long-term effects of density on fledgling survival, recruitment rates or natal dispersal in wild populations. Here, we used observational data from a 13-year study on the reproduction of a facultatively gregarious bird, the Spotless Starling, Sturnus unicolor, to investigate the consequences of breeding density for fitness and offspring natal dispersal. We compared breeding performance, recruitment success and dispersal distances of offspring arising from nest-boxes placed in either a high (HD) or a low density (LD). We found that although neither clutch size nor fledgling survival varied in relation to density, HD nests produced significantly fewer recruits. Moreover, recruits from HD nests settled closer to their natal territories than those from LD nests. These findings suggest that the proximity to neighbours incurs delayed fitness costs in the Spotless Starling. Furthermore, the negative density-dependent dispersal may result from the increased mortality of individuals in worse condition and with lower ability to compete for breeding vacancies in the vicinity of their natal territories. With this study, we provide long-term observational results that may be a basis for further experiments intended to unravel proximate mechanisms underpinning density-dependent patterns in wild breeding colonies.  2019, Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V."

We administered a physiological dose of testosterone (T) to yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) eggs and found that, compared to controls, telomere length shortly before hatching was reduced in the liver but unaffected in the brain, heart, and pectoralis muscle. Telomere length varied across somatic tissues, and, independent of egg treatment, it was not correlated between them, suggesting independent telomere dynamics. Thus, we showed for the first time that increased egg T can increase telomere shortening in the embryo and that maternal T allocation strategies may evolve also in response to such effect. Moreover, contrary to observations in adult birds, at the embryonic stage telomere length in one somatic tissue may not reflect telomere length in other body districts.  2019 by The University of Chicago."

Studies in different taxa showed that these behavioural phenotypic correlations are not universal within a species and can differ between populations exposed to different environmental pressures. Empirical studies are required to better understand the relative contributions of long-term adaptive processes and direct ontogenetic mechanisms in the development of these phenotypic behavioural correlations. In the present study, we investigated the role of postnatal nurturing care on the development of behavioural correlations in a precocial bird model, the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica). We compared phenotypic correlations between two populations: 41 artificially reared birds (maternally deprived) and 36 birds fostered by unrelated females. Behavioural responses were measured at the age when birds naturally disperse, with three widely used behavioural tests to assess fearfulness and sociality: tonic immobility, open-field and emergence tests. Our results show that when quail chicks are reared by a foster mother, more phenotypic correlations appeared in the population including correlations within and across behavioural functions and between behavioural responses and chick mass. In contrast, chicks reared without a foster mother presented much fewer behavioural correlations and those were limited to functionally linked behaviours. Our results also highlight that the effect of mothering on phenotypic correlations is sex-specific, with a greater effect on males. We discuss the organisational role of parents on the development of behavioural correlations, the mechanisms likely to support this influence, as well as the reasons for sexual dimorphism. Significance statement: Mothers deeply influence the behavioural development of their offspring during the postnatal stage. Whether maternal presence and nurturing behaviour also affect correlations between behavioural responses of their offspring at a population level remains underexplored and unclear. In the current study, we used an adoption procedure to demonstrate the critical role of maternal postnatal care for the development of behavioural correlations in a precocial bird model widely used for the study of behavioural ontogeny: the Japanese quail. Our findings highlight that the presence of a maternally behaving female during early life promotes the development of correlations between behavioural responses both within and across behavioural functions in males but not in females.  2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

As a continuous source of challenge and stress for organisms, the environment has promoted the evolution of physiological adaptations and led to a great variation in corticosterone profiles within or among individuals, populations and species. In order to evolve via natural selection, corticosterone levels do not only depend on the strength of selection exerted on them, but also on the extent to which the regulation of corticosterone is heritable. Nevertheless, the heritability of corticosterone profiles in wild populations is still poorly understood. In this study, we estimated the heritability of baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels in barn owl (Tyto alba) nestlings from 8 years of data, using a multivariate animal model based on a behavioural pedigree. We found that baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels are strongly genetically correlated (r = 0.680.80) and that the heritability of stress-induced corticosterone levels (h2 = 0.240.33) was moderate and similar to the heritability of baseline corticosterone levels (h2 = 0.190.30). These findings suggest that the regulation of stress-induced corticosterone and baseline levels evolves at a similar pace when selection acts with the same intensity on both traits and that contrary to previous studies, the evolution of baseline and stress-induced level is interdependent in barn owls, as they may be strongly genetically correlated.  2019, The Genetics Society."

In the Greater Rhea (Rhea americana), we previously found that yolk immunoreactive corticosterone is influenced by the quality of the maternal environment: eggs laid by females of the intensive rearing system (IRS), living in poor captive conditions, had higher yolk immunoreactive corticosterone than those produced by females of the semi-extensive rearing system (SRS), living in better conditions. Here, we evaluate if these different hormone levels are associated with the production of different phenotypes. We collected eggs from the IRS and SRS for hormonal quantification and artificial incubation. Then, half of the chicks selected from each environment were exposed to a capture and restraint protocol, and the rest remained undisturbed and were used as controls. In the IRS, we found that higher yolk immunoreactive corticosterone was associated with the production of chicks that had reduced hatchability, lower hatchling mass and higher baseline fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGM) than those produced by SRS females. Moreover, after capture and restraint, IRS chicks did not modify their FGM nor their behaviors compared to their controls, while SRS chicks increased their FGM and spent more time ambulating and less time pecking, compared to their controls. These results indicate that yolk immunoreactive corticosterone could modify offspring phenotype. Although future studies are needed to elucidate their implications for fitness, our results suggest that yolk corticosterone could be mediating an adaptive maternal effect that allows individuals to better cope with poor conditions.  2019 Elsevier Inc."

Weight and number of eggs were measured; serum and the largest follicles were collected and used for hormone measurement. Ovaries and adrenals were collected for expression analysis of 3- and 17-HSD, genes encoding steroidogenic enzymes. Egg weight slightly decreased with an increase in the treatment time in the heat-challenged group; the egg weight significantly decreased in the heat treatment group than in the control group during the last 2 days of experiment (P < 0.05). The laying rate showed no difference during the experimental period but significantly decreased on the last day in the heat treatment group. In the experimental group the ovaries and oviducts were lighter (P < 0.05) and the hierarchical follicle number and ovarian weight decreased (P < 0.05) compared to the control group. Although serum corticosterone level significantly increased after heat challenge (P < 0.05) and immediately recovered to the normal level, yolk immunoreactive corticosterone in the hierarchical follicle (F1, F2, F3) significantly increased (P < 0.05). The expression level of 17-HSD showed no changes in the ovary but significantly increased in adrenals (P < 0.05). Our findings indicate that the effects of heat challenge on the maternal ovary in the quail are mediated through the adrenal function.  2019 Elsevier Inc."

We studied maternal nesting behaviour in a western painted turtle, Chrysemys picta, population in northern Idaho, U.S.A. During 20132016, we examined maternal choice of nest microhabitat and used correlational data to quantify consequences on egg survival. In 2017, we conducted a cross-fostering experiment to decouple the effects of intrinsic maternal effects from extrinsic environmental factors on egg survival, while simultaneously manipulating the level of nest shade cover and distance from water using artificial nests. Females chose nest sites that were more open and warmer than randomly available habitat. Additionally, of three nesting areas, the coolest area with the most shade cover was used least by nesting females. Egg survival was associated with nest temperature in some, but not all, years. In the cross-fostering experiment, egg survival did not differ between natal and foster eggs, but was greater in maternal nests than in artificial nests. Additionally, egg survival increased with canopy openness and minimum nest temperature, especially for eggs in artificial nests. Overall, these results suggest that females select nesting conditions (warm and open nest sites) that positively affect hatching success.  2019"

Using wild blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), we provide, to our knowledge, the first investigation into the effects of increasing maternal investment in offspring production for subsequent contributions to nestling provisioning by mothers and male partners. Females that were induced to lay two extra eggs provisioned nestlings 43% more frequently than controls, despite clutch size being made comparable between treatment groups at the onset of incubation. Further, experimental males did not significantly reduce provisioning rates as expected by partial compensation, and if anything contributed slightly (9%) more than controls. Finally, nestlings were significantly heavier in experimental nests compared with controls, suggesting that the 22% average increase in provisioning rates by experimental pairs was beneficial. Our results have potential implications for our understanding of provisioning rules, the maintenance of bi-parental care and the timescale over which current-future life-history trade-offs operate.

Postnatal reduction is the dominant strategy, presumably because surplus progeny serves as a hedge against environmental and developmental uncertainty. In birds, its main proximate mechanism is asynchronous hatching, generating within-brood competitive asymmetry. Here, clutch-size reduction via last-egg abandonment was investigated in the asynchronously hatching red-necked grebe in a study area comprising 2 human-managed poorly predictable habitats with distinctly different food supplies. Last-egg abandonment, virtually absent in favorable food conditions, occurred regularly in larger clutches in conditions of brood-stage food scarcity. In the food-poor habitat, the production and body condition of fledglings did not differ between last-egg abandoning and caring pairs. The experimentally prolonged hatching interval increased the egg abandonment rate (irrespective of clutch size), but mainly in food-poor conditions. This is the first demonstration of parental clutch reduction in anticipation of brood-stage food limitation. Last-egg abandonment functions as an equivalent of abortion, as discarded offspring are excluded from the postnatal selection arena. This strategy might have evolved as ""best-of-a-bad-job"" to reallocate parental resources when a strong mismatch between clutch size and chick survival probability reduced the hedging value of later-laid eggs.

But even if the number of matings is standardized, such studies conflate any costs of interacting with males with the potential benefits of receiving sperm from several males, obscuring the benefits of polyandry. We conducted a 22 factorial experiment on the mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki to quantify the independent effects of male harassment and polyandry. We artificially inseminated virgin females with sperm from either 1 or 5 males (monandry vs. polyandry). Females were then housed in the presence or absence of reproductively ablated males who could harass, but not mate with them. Our design ensured that the number of males inseminating a female was independent of the level of male harassment and the number of matings she received. Females who were not housed with males were instead housed with immature females to maintain densities constant across treatments. Unexpectedly, females that experienced sexual harassment were more likely to give birth, had shorter gestation periods and gave birth to larger broods. Furthermore, polyandrous females were more likely than monandrous females to give birth. Polyandrous females' sons also reached maturity faster than those of monandrous females. We therefore found no detectable costs to females producing their first brood of being harassed by males when the direct costs of mating were absent. We also showed that, in the absence of mating costs, there are direct and indirect fitness benefits of being inseminated by multiple males.

In ectotherms, sex determination involves a variety of mechanisms including genetic determination (GSD), environment determination (ESD), but also interactions between the two via sex reversal. In this study, we investigated whether water deprivation during pregnancy could override GSD in two heterogametic squamate reptiles. We demonstrated that water restriction in early gestation induced a male-biased secondary sex ratio in both species, which could be explained by water sex reversal as the more likely mechanism. We further monitored some long-term fitness estimates of offspring, which suggested that water sex determination (WSD) represented a compensatory strategy producing the rarest sex according to Fisher's assumptions of frequency-dependent selection models. This study provides new insights into sex determination modes and calls for a general investigation of mechanisms behind WSD and to examine the evolutionary implications.

In particular, many studies have focused on how developmental stress can give rise to variation in adult behaviour, physiology, and performance. However, there remains a poor understanding of whether general patterns exist in the effects and magnitude of phenotypic responses across taxonomic groups. Furthermore, given the extensive phenotypic variation that arises from developmental stressors, it remains important to ascertain how multiple processes may explain these responses. We compiled data from 111 studies to examine and quantify the effect of developmental stress on animal phenotype and performance from juveniles to adulthood, including studies from birds, reptiles, fish, mammals, insects, arachnids, and amphibians. Using meta-analytic approaches, we show that across all studies there is, on average, a moderate to large negative effect of developmental stress exposure (posterior mean effect: |d| = 0.51) on animal phenotype or performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that interactive effects of timing of stressor onset and the duration of exposure to stressors best explained variation in developmental stress responses. Animals exposed to stressors earlier in development had more-positive responses than those with later onset, whereas longer duration of exposure to a stressor caused responses to be stronger in magnitude. However, the high amount of heterogeneity in our results, and the low degree of variance explained by fixed effects in both the meta-analysis (R 2 = 0.034) and top-ranked meta-regression model (R 2 = 0.02), indicate that phenotypic responses to developmental stressors are likely highly idiosyncratic in nature and difficult to predict. Despite this, our analyses address a critical knowledge gap in understanding what effect developmental stress has on phenotypic variation in animals. Additionally, our results highlight important environmental and proximate factors that may influence phenotypic responses to developmental stressors.  2019 Cambridge Philosophical Society"

Labile traits, such as behaviour, vary within and among individuals owing to (i) reversible plasticity and (ii) developmental plasticity and genetic make-up, respectively. Here, we test whether developmental environments affect the expression of both within- and among-individual variation in behaviour. In ectothermic species, low temperatures are associated with a reduced expression of behaviour and can also limit the expression of reversible plasticity and among-individual differentiation, for example, by restricting the expression of additive genetic variation. We focused on exploratory behaviour since activity-related behaviours are assumed to be temperature-dependent in ectotherms. Specifically, low temperatures can restrict the physiological machinery needed for movement. To test our predictions, we raised field crickets, Gryllus bimaculatus, at low versus high temperatures throughout ontogeny and compared behavioural means and variance components (i.e. among- and within-individual variances) across treatments. We also compared the coefficients of variation for each variance component across treatments to assess whether environmental effects on variance were independent of the effects on mean behaviour. As predicted, individuals raised at high temperatures were more explorative and exhibited more among- and within-individual variance compared to individuals raised at low temperatures. Interestingly, individuals raised under high temperatures became more stable in their behaviour when controlling for treatment effects on average behaviour. Our results show experimentally that different developmental temperatures trigger different amounts of behavioural stability in exploratory behaviour, thereby suggesting a key role for temperature in affecting the ecological processes associated with exploratory behaviour in ectothermic species. Significance statement: Individuals differ relative to one another in their mean behavioural expression (i.e. animal personality), while, at the same time, individuals change their behaviour from one instance to the next (i.e. reversible plasticity). Expression of both above-mentioned components should strongly depend on environments experienced throughout ontogeny. Temperature represents a key environmental factor in most ectothermic animals as it directly affects the ability to express behaviour. Here, we experimentally test whether temperature experienced throughout ontogeny has permanent effects on the expression of individual differences and reversible plasticity in behaviour later in life. We show that individuals become more stable, i.e. express less reversible plasticity, in risky exploratory behaviour when raised under high temperatures. Our results thus suggest a key role for temperature in affecting the ecological processes associated with risky behaviours in ectothermic species.  2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

While there is quite a lot of evidence for the importance of odour for social behaviour, it is not known as yet which brain areas may be involved in the processing of socially relevant odours. We therefore compared the brain activation pattern of zebra finch males exposed to their own offspring odour with that induced by a neutral odour stimulus. By measuring head saccade changes as behavioural reaction and using the expression of the immediate early gene product c-Fos as brain activity marker, we show here that the activation pattern, namely the activity difference between the left and the right hemisphere, of several hippocampal areas in zebra finch males is altered by the presentation of the odour of their own nestlings. In contrast, the nucleus taeniae of the amygdala (TnA) exhibits a tendency of a reduction of c-Fos activation in both hemispheres as a consequence of exposure to the nestling odour. We conclude that the hippocampus is involved in odour based processing of social information, while the role of TnA remains unclear.  2019 Elsevier B.V."

Here, we test, using a simulated induction of the reproductive system through a Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) challenge, whether the ovary of pre-breeding female great tits responds to brain stimulation by increasing oestradiol. We also assess how this response is modified by individual-specific traits like age, ovarian follicle size, and personality, using females from lines artificially selected for divergent levels of exploratory behaviour. We show that a GnRH injection leads to a rapid increase in circulating concentrations of oestradiol, but responses varied among individuals. Females with more developed ovarian follicles showed stronger responses and females from lines selected for fast exploratory behaviour showed stronger increases compared to females from the slow line, indicating a heritable component. This study shows that the response of the ovary to reproductive stimulation from the brain greatly varies among individuals and that this variation can be attributed to several commonly measured individual traits, which sheds light on the mechanisms shaping heritable endocrine phenotypes.  2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

In this study, we examined several maternally derived egg compounds; namely yolk mass, egg white lysozyme and pH, yolk testosterone, oestrogens and eggshell colour and we determined the abundance of cultivable bacteria on the eggshell surface of blackbirds eggs Turdus merula. Based on that, we examined whether there is an association between eggshell colour parameters derived via spectrophotometric analyses and eggshell spot size and any of the investigated egg parameters. Our results suggest that two eggshell colour components derived by a principle component analyses and eggshell spot size covary with different egg parameters. We found that eggs containing more UV, yellow and red chroma in their eggshells contain heavier yolks. In contrast more bluish, greener and brighter eggs have to face higher loads of bacteria i.p. haemolytic bacteria and bacteria originating from the urogenital tract of the female.

However, a host's efforts to compensate for possible parasite-induced fitness effects are less well-known. Parental effects may beneficially alter the offspring phenotype if parental environments sufficiently predict the offspring environment. Parasitism is a common stressor across generations; therefore, parental infestation could reliably predict the likelihood of infestation for offspring. However, little is known about relationships between parasitism and transgenerational phenotypic plasticity. Thus, we investigated how maternal and grandmaternal infestation with fleas (Xenopsylla ramesis) affected offspring quality and quantity in a desert rodent (Meriones crassus). We used a fully-crossed design with control and infested treatments to examine litter size, pup body mass at birth, and pup mass gain before weaning for combinations of maternal and grandmaternal infestation status. No effect of treatment on litter size or pup body mass at birth was found. However, maternal and grandmaternal infestation status significantly affected pre-weaning body mass gain, a proxy for the rate of maturation, in male pups. Pups gained significantly more weight before weaning if maternal and grandmaternal infestation statuses matched, regardless of the treatment. Thus, pups whose mothers and grandmothers experienced similar risks of parasitism, either both non-parasitized or both infested, would reach sexual maturity more quickly than those pups whose mothers infestation status did not match that of their grandmothers. These results support the contention that parents can receive external cues such as the risk of parasitism, that prompt them to alter offspring provisioning. Therefore, parasites could be a mediator of environmentally-induced maternal effects and could affect host reproductive fitness across multiple generations.  2019 Australian Society for Parasitology"

Within avian broods, differential maternal investment of resources across the laying sequence is thought to be an adaptive strategy to modulate competitive hierarchies induced by hatching asynchrony. In this study, we evaluated the relative importance of maternally derived within-clutch variation and the asymmetric post-hatching environment for growth and survival of common tern (Sterna hirundo) siblings. We experimentally manipulated hatching order, resulting in chicks from last-laid eggs hatching first and vice versa. Although both initial age and size asymmetries were larger within experimental than control broods, the early survival of last-hatched chicks was similar between groups. Initial positive effects of egg size disappeared as siblings approached fledging. Ultimately at fledging, both within-brood growth and cumulative survival patterns were similar between experimental and control broods, suggesting that the effects of systematic variation of egg constituents (e.g., maternally derived yolk hormones) and egg size are too subtle and largely overwhelmed by the effects of hatching asynchrony. Therefore, we conclude that variation in offspring phenotypes is pre-dominantly determined by the social environment experienced post-hatching. Maternal effects may further fine-tune phenotypic variation in response to varying environmental conditions, but this needs to be tested through empirical studies in which multiple maternal effects are measured simultaneously under different environmental conditions.  2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Higher temperatures during egg-laying may reduce maintenance costs for females and allow a higher investment in reproduction. Yet, females may also use temperatures as a cue for the risk of mismatch latter in the season. Thus, higher temperatures may be correlated to an acceleration of embryonic development (e.g. via hormonal manipulation). We performed an experiment in which night-time temperature was increased in the nestbox by approximately 1 C throughout the entire laying period in great tits (Parus major). We collected one pre-treatment egg (beginning of the laying sequence) and one post-treatment egg (end of the laying sequence). Egg content (yolk androgens and lysozymes in the albumen), eggshell coloration, eggshell mass, egg mass, and shape were not affected by the treatment. However, last-laid eggs in clutches from control nestboxes had a thicker eggshell than last-laid eggs from heated nestboxes, suggesting a putative slight decrease of maternal investment with the experimental increase of temperature. We also observed effects of the laying sequence on egg characteristics. Eggs that were laid late in the laying sequence were heavier, larger, had larger spots and higher yolk androgens than eggs laid earlier. Lysozyme concentration decrease with the laying sequence in late clutches only. Thus, effects of temperature may also change with the laying sequence and it would be interesting in the future to tests the effects on first-laid eggs.  2019 Elsevier Inc."

Days after supplementation ended, food-supplemented nestlings were in better condition than nonsupplemented nestlings and begged for food at an increased rate; their parents, in turn, increased provisioning to a greater extent than parents of nonsupplemented young, as begging positively predicted provisioning. Food-supplemented nestlings therefore attained above-average condition, which predicted their recruitment as breeding adults in the local population. Glucocorticoids increased begging in the short term, but this transient effect depended on satiety. Thus, glucocorticoids promoted begging as a proximate response to hunger, whereas the longer-term changes in nestling condition, begging, and food provisioning suggest that begging ultimately signals offspring quality to elicit increased investment, thereby enhancing offspring survival.  2019 by The University of Chicago."

Repeated short exposure of Atlantic salmon to cold water and air during embryonic (E), post-hatch (PH) or both phases of development (EPH) has been shown to alter the methylome and transcriptome and to affect growth performance during later life compared to untreated controls (CO). The aim of this study was to investigate how the transcriptome of these fish responds to subsequent acute stress at the start feeding stage, and to describe methylation differences that might steer these changes. EPH treated fish showed the strongest down-regulation of corticotropin releasing factor 1, up-regulation of glucocorticoid receptor and 3-oxo-5-alpha-steroid 4-dehydrogenase 2 gene expression and a suppressed cortisol response 3 hr after the acute stress, differences that could influence hormesis and be affecting how EPH fish cope and recover from the stress event. Growth hormone 2 and insulin-like growth factor 1 were more strongly down-regulated following acute stress in EPH treated fish relative to E, PH and CO fish. This indicates switching away from growth toward coping with stress following stressful events in EPH fish. Genes implicated in immune function such as major histocompatibility class 1A, T-cell receptor and toll-like receptor also responded to acute stress differently in EPH treated fish, indicating that repeated stresses during early life may affect robustness. Differential DNA methylation was detected in regions mapping,500 bases from genes differentially responding to acute stress suggesting the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms. Stress treatments applied during early development therefore have potential as a husbandry tool for boosting the productivity of aquaculture by affecting how fish respond to stresses at critical stages of production.

In passerines, aggression during nest-site defence is one of those behaviours that have been steadily found to be repeatable within individuals. Furthermore, in several cases, aggression was related to some estimates of reproductive investment. Here, we studied the possibility that behaviour of males toward a male rival predicts the amount of their future parental care. This could be beneficial to the females, because during mate choice, they could use male aggressive behaviour as a cue for parental quality. We performed the study by video recording the nestling feeding activity of male collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) that were assayed for aggression during the courtship period. The level of aggression was not related to feeding rate in males. Feeding rate of males differed between the study years, but it did not correlate with the feeding rate of their mates, neither was it related to the morphological traits of the parents. We may conclude that nest-site defence aggression of males does not predict their parental commitment. This may be surprising given that higher testosterone levels that may be expected in aggressive males often suppress parental care. However, among-individual variance in male testosterone profiles found to be decrease from the courtship to the parenting period in flycatchers, and this may explain why differences in territorial aggression did not manifest in differences in nestling provisioning. The correlation between behaviours that are expressed in distinct periods of the annual cycle of songbirds needs further investigation. Significance statement: Male songbirds, when attracting mates, are often confronted with each other over nest-sites, and these male-male confrontations may be witnessed by females. If performance during territory defence predicts the quality of parental care that a male will provide for its nestlings, females could use defence behaviour as a cue for mate choice. To explore this possibility, we investigated the relationship between territorial aggression and nestling feeding activity of male collared flycatchers. We performed simulated territorial intrusions to measure the aggression of males and recorded their nestling feeding rate about a month later. We found that territorial aggression did not correlate with nestling feeding rate. This suggests that nest-site defence behaviour in the beginning of the breeding season does not carry information for females about what to expect from potential mates in terms of parental care.  2019, The Author(s)."

Hormone synthesis is sensitive to environmental factors, and maternal hormones are thus a powerful mechanism to transfer environmental cues to the next generation. Birds have become a key model for the study of hormone-mediated maternal effects because the embryo develops outside the mothers body, facilitating the measurement and manipulation of prenatal hormone exposure. At the same time, birds are excellent models for the integration of both proximate and ultimate approaches, which is key to a better understanding of the evolution of hormone-mediated maternal effects. Over the past two decades, a surge of studies on hormone-mediated maternal effects has revealed an increasing number of discrepancies. In this review, we discuss the role of the environment, genetic factors and social interactions in causing these discrepancies and provide a framework to resolve them. We also explore the largely neglected role of the embryo in modulating the maternal signal, as well as costs and benefits of hormone transfer and expression for the different family members. We conclude by highlighting fruitful avenues for future research that have opened up thanks to new theoretical insights and technical advances in the field.

In some cases, these changes may increase offspring fitness but, in others, they can elevate parental fitness at a cost to the fitness of their offspring. We show that in Kalahari meerkats (Suricata suricatta), the circulating glucocorticoid (GC) hormones of pregnant females affect the growth and cooperative behaviour of their offspring. We performed a 3-year experiment in wild meerkats to test the hypothesis that GC-mediated maternal effects reduce the potential for offspring to reproduce directly and therefore cause them to exhibit more cooperative behaviour. Daughters (but not sons) born to mothers treated with cortisol during pregnancy grew more slowly early in life and exhibited significantly more of two types of cooperative behaviour (pup rearing and feeding) once they were adults compared to offspring from control mothers. They also had lower measures of GCs as they aged, which could explain the observed increases in cooperative behaviour. Because early life growth is a crucial determinant of fitness in female meerkats, our results indicate that GC-mediated maternal effects may reduce the fitness of offspring, but may elevate parental fitness as a consequence of increasing the cooperative behaviour of their daughters.

It is unknown, however, whether stress axis programming can affect the development of social competence, and if so, by which mechanism(s). Here, we used pharmacological manipulations to persistently reprogramme the hypothalamicpituitaryinterrenal axis of juvenile cooperatively breeding cichlids, Neolamprologus pulcher. During the first two months of life, juveniles were repeatedly treated with cortisol, mifepristone or control treatments. Three months after the last manipulation, we tested for treatment effects on (i) social competence, (ii) the expression of genes coding for corticotropin-releasing factor (crf), glucocorticoid receptor (gr1) and mineralocorticoid receptor (mr) in the telencephalon and hypothalamus and (iii) cortisol levels. Social competence in a social challenge was reduced in cortisol-treated juveniles, which is in accordance with previous work applying early-life manipulations using different social experiences. During early life, both cortisol and mifepristone treatments induced a persistent downregulation of crf and upregulation of mr in the telencephalon. We suggest that these persistent changes in stress gene expression may represent an effective physiological mechanism for coping with stress.

Hatching order may create a considerable size hierarchy within a brood and lead to earlier-hatched nestlings having a competitive advantage over their siblings, which has been illustrated in some studies. However, there have been few explorations into the effect on subsequent generations. Here, using a 15-year-long study, we investigated the long-term fitness consequences of hatching order in the endangered crested ibis, Nipponia nippon, a species with complete hatching asynchrony. In this study, we found strong support for silver spoon effects acting on hatching order. Compared with later-hatched nestlings, first-hatched nestlings begin reproduction at an earlier age, have higher adult survival rates, possess a longer breeding life span, and achieve higher lifetime reproductive success. Interestingly, we found carry-over effects of hatching order into the next generation. Nestlings which hatched earlier and became breeders in turn also produced nestlings with larger tarsus and better body condition. Additionally, we found a positive correlation among life-history traits in crested ibis. Individuals which started reproduction at a younger age were shown to possess a longer breeding life span, and the annual brood size increased with an individual's breeding life span. This suggests that the earlier-hatched nestlings are of better quality and the ""silver spoon"" effects of hatching order cover all life-history stages and next generation effects.  2018 The Author(s).

Previous avian studies have shown that the transfer of maternally derived hormones, such as progesterone and testosterone, to the egg, affects many aspects of offspring development. In contrast, the impact of maternal corticosterone (CORT) is much less studied. CORT, the principal avian glucocorticoid hormone, is thought to be passively transferred to the egg yolk from the maternal plasma. Maternal CORT may play a role in determining the development of young birds by adaptively programming offspring for their environment. We developed a protocol which effectively quantifies yolk CORT concentrations both within and across clutches, using solid-phase extraction and radioimmunoassay. We hypothesised that Gouldian Finch (Erythrura gouldiae) mothers would differ in their yolk CORT concentrations and that maternal condition would relate to absolute yolk CORT deposition. We found variation in yolk CORT concentrations between clutches, whilst yolk CORT increased with egg number in the first breeding season and negatively correlated with yolk mass. Yet, contrary to our predictions, neither maternal mass nor clutch size showed any relationship to yolk CORT concentrations or to egg or yolk mass. Our data suggest that yolk CORT varies with maternal identity for reasons which do not appear to be linked to maternal condition. Further research is needed to determine the link between maternal and egg yolk concentrations at the individual level. Such tests would be valuable for understanding the role of CORT in the reproductive effects previously observed in this threatened species.  2018,  2018 BirdLife Australia."

Using 24 years of data on age-specific common tern (Sterna hirundo) chick mortality, best described by the Gompertz function, and estimates of energy consumption per age of mortality, we investigated how energy wasted on nonfledged chicks depends on brood size, hatching order, and annual abundance of herring (Clupea harengus), the main food source. We found mortality directly after hatching (Gompertz baseline mortality) to be high and to increase with decreasing herring abundance. Mortality declined with age at a rate relatively insensitive to herring abundance. The sensitivity of baseline mortality to herring abundance reduced energy wasted on nonfledged chicks when herring was in short supply. Among chicks that did not fledge, last-hatched chicks were less costly than earlier-hatched chicks because of their earlier mortality. However, per hatchling produced, the least energy was wasted on chicks without siblings because their baseline mortality was most sensitive to herring abundance. We suggest that earlier mortality of offspring when food is short facilitates economic adjustment of posthatch-ing parental investment to food abundance but that such economic brood reduction may be constrained by sibling competition.  2019 by The University of Chicago."

In addition to affecting physiology of individuals directly, EDCs may alter the transfer of maternal hormones to offspring, i.e. causing transgenerational endocrine disruption. However, such effects have been rarely studied, especially in wild populations. We studied the associations between environmental elemental pollution (As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb) and maternally-derived egg thyroid hormones (THs) as well as nestling THs in great tits (Parus major) using extensive sampling of four pairs of polluted and reference populations across Europe (Finland, Belgium, Hungary, Portugal). Previous studies in these populations showed that breeding success, nestling growth and adult and nestling physiology were altered in polluted zones compared to reference zones. We sampled non-incubated eggs to measure maternally-derived egg THs, measured nestling plasma THs and used nestling faeces for assessing local elemental exposure. We also studied whether the effect of elemental pollution on endocrine traits is dependent on calcium (Ca) availability (faecal Ca as a proxy) as low Ca increases toxicity of some elements. Birds in the polluted zones were exposed to markedly higher levels of toxic elements than in reference zones at the populations in Finland, Belgium and Hungary. In contrast to our predictions, we did not find any associations between overall elemental pollution, or individual element concentrations and egg TH and nestling plasma TH levels. However, we found some indication that the effect of metals (Cd and Cu) on egg THs is dependent on Ca availability. In summary, our results suggest that elemental pollution at the studied populations is unlikely to cause overall TH disruption and affect breeding via altered egg or nestling TH levels with the current elemental pollution loads. Associations with Ca availability should be further studied.  2019"

Hormone concentrations within and between maternal and uterine compartments were compared using two markers of embryo development. Histotroph had consistently higher detection rates and concentrations of hormones than maternal plasma, especially during early pregnancy when embryos are yolk sac-dependent for nutrition.

We hypothesized that human behaviour triggers maternal effects via variations in yolk hormone levels. For five consecutive weeks, two groups of hens were exposed to the same durations of human presence (30 min twice a day, five days a week) but the behaviour of the human differed between groups. The first group (H+) was exposed to predictable arrival of the experimenter, slow movements combined with static presence, stroking during handling and human voice. Whereas the second group of hens (H-) was exposed to unpredictable arrival of the experimenter which remained silent, in motion, and did not provide stroking during handling. At the end of the treatment, we evaluated egg quality and offspring behaviour. We found that avoidance of the experimenter by H+ hens but not by H hens decreased significantly. Fertility rates and concentrations of yolk progesterone and estradiol in H+ hens' eggs were higher than in H hens' eggs. Fear of humans, neophobia or the capacity to solve a detour task did not differ significantly between H+ and H chicks. Social discrimination tests showed that H+ chicks but not H chicks typically preferred a familiar conspecific to a stranger. These results show that, with the same duration in the presence of the birds, humans through their behaviour engender variations in fertility rates, yolk hormone levels and transgenerational effects on social skills. Rarely explored, our data suggest that maternal effects influence filial imprinting. These data have broad implications for laboratory, commercial systems and conservatory programs where the inevitable presence of humans could trigger maternal effects on offspring phenotype.  2019 Elsevier Inc."

In this review we analyze and integrate the different measurements of glucocorticoids (in plasma, feces, and yolk) carried out in different captive and wild populations, taking into account the diverse predictable and unpredictable conditions to which the Greater Rhea responds in each of those environments. In addition, the translocation of this bird is presented as an application of stress physiology in field ecology for conservation purposes, in which we evaluated how this species responds when it is released into a novel environment. Our results indicate that this ratite has a striking high sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis compared to that of other bird species and shows a wide variety of adrenocortical responses depending on the environment in which it lives. This suggests that its HPA axis has a phenotypic plasticity that enables the rhea to cope with the environmental challenges. In this sense, we propose that one of the routes of this plasticity could be mediated by the maternal transfer of steroid hormones to the egg.

Historically, a major emphasis has been characterizing estrogen-induced genomic actions resulting from binding to nuclear estrogen receptor 1 (nESR1). However, recent evidence indicates the first receptors estrogens encounter as they enter a cell, membrane ESR1 (mESR1), also play crucial roles. Membrane and nuclear ESR are derived from the same transcripts but the former are directed to the membrane via palmitoylation. Binding and activation of mESR1 leads to rapid fluctuations in cAMP and Ca +2 and stimulation of protein kinase pathways. Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) that mimic 17-estradiol can signal through mESR1 and elicit non-genomic effects. Most current EDC studies have focused on genomic actions via nESR1. However, increasing number of studies have begun to examine potential EDC effects mediated through mESR1, and some EDC might have higher potency for signaling through mESR1 than nESR1. The notion that such chemicals might also affect mESR1 signaling via palmitoylation and depalmitoylation pathways has also begun to gain currency. Recent development of transgenic mice that lack either mESR1 or nESR1, while retaining functional ESR1 in the other compartment, will allow more precise in vivo approaches to determine EDC effects through nESR1 and/or mESR1.

If stress occurs during reproduction, the resulting offspring can show altered phenotypes that are thought to arise from increased exposure to maternal glucocorticoids. Developing offspring can metabolize maternal glucocorticoids, which can alter the pattern of exposure they encounter. For egg laying vertebrates, we are just beginning to understand how embryonic steroid metabolism impacts embryonic exposure to maternal glucocorticoids. Here we injected three doses of radioactive corticosterone into Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) eggs to determine the degree of embryonic exposure at days six and nine of development. We found that increasing injection dose increased the amount of radioactivity found in the embryo at day six but by day nine the effect of injection dose disappeared as the amount of radioactivity within the embryo dropped to equivalent levels for all three doses. Interestingly, when examined as a percentage of initial dose, there were no differences between treatment groups at any time points. Importantly, using thin-layer chromatography we characterized that some free steroid, putatively identified as corticosterone, does reach the developing embryo. Together, our data suggest that the in ovo metabolism of maternal corticosterone can eventually eliminate it from the egg, but before this happens, embryos developing in eggs with elevated amounts of maternal corticosterone are exposed to higher levels early in development. This has important implications for how we understand the developmental steroid environment and the mechanisms underlying maternal stress effects.  2018 Elsevier Inc."

To test the effects of developmental stress on nestling and adult body composition, we dosed nestling zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) with either a corticosterone (CORT) or control treatment. We calculated condition indices (scaled mass, residual mass, and ratio indices) from morphometric measurements and used quantitative magnetic resonance (QMR) to assess body composition during early development and adulthood. We compared these three traditionally-used condition indices to QMR-derived body composition measurements, to test how well they predict relative fat mass. Our results show that developmental stress decreases body mass, and has a dose-dependent effect on tarsus length in nestling birds. Furthermore, stress treatment during the nestling period had long-lasting effects on adult body mass, lean mass and tarsus length. None of the three condition indices were good indicators of relative fat mass in nestlings, but all indices were closely associated with relative fat mass in adults. The scaled mass index was more closely associated with relative fat mass than the other condition indices, when calculated from wing chord length in nestlings. In adults however, the residual mass index and the ratio index were better indicators of relative body fat than the scaled mass index, when calculated from tarsus length. Our data demonstrate the short and long-term impact of developmental stress on birds, and highlight important age-related factors to consider when using condition indices.  2018 Elsevier Inc."

We investigated food allocation and parent and chick behaviours in Magellanic penguins at their colony in Punta Tombo, Argentina, by observing feedings in one- and two-chick broods after the chicks were more than 20 days of age. Feeds lasted 21 min on average, and the length of a feed was not correlated either with the number of chicks in a brood, or with the amount of food the parents gave. Parents with two-chick broods distributed food evenly to both chicks. Although single chicks were fed more than chicks with siblings, as a proportion of a chick's start weight, both single chicks and lighter chicks in two-chick broods received significantly more food than heavier chicks. Chicks continued begging after the last feed in nearly half of the two-chick broods, suggesting they were not sated and so are food-limited. In linear mixed-effects models that considered, respectively, the absolute amount of food a chick received and the amount of food it received as a proportion of its start weight, chick begging was the most significant predictor of how much it was fed. Jostling behaviours between the chicks did not correlate with the amount of food either one received. Parental nonfeeding behaviours in two-chick broods (e.g. bending towards a chick and opening the bill but not regurgitating food) were more frequently directed at the lighter chick, but did not correlate with the amount of food a chick received. These results suggest (1) parents are motived to feed their chicks quickly, (2) parents try to allocate food equally to chicks of this age and (3) chicks devote most of their energy trying to get fed by the parent, rather than competing antagonistically with one another.  2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour"

Egg maternal substances can have interacting effects, but experimental studies of the consequences of the combined variation in the egg concentration of such molecules are extremely rare, particularly as far as prenatal stages are concerned. We manipulated the yolk concentration of vitamin E and corticosterone, which are, respectively, the main antioxidant and the main glucocorticoid hormone in bird eggs, both independently and simultaneously, and we tested their separate and combined effects on growth and oxidative status in the liver and in the brain of yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) embryos. Egg supplementation of relatively large physiological doses of corticosterone depressed embryo growth (total body mass, tarsus length and liver mass), whereas administration of vitamin E in association with corticosterone restored normal growth. Vitamin E did not affect embryo growth when administered alone. We further analysed the independent and combined effects of vitamin E and corticosterone on liver and brain total antioxidant capacity, the concentration of reactive oxygen molecules and lipid peroxidation. Vitamin E significantly reduced liver total antioxidant capacity, while corticosterone depressed brain lipid peroxidation. Prenatal exposure to vitamin E and corticosterone appears to have antagonistic effects on body growth, although vitamin E is not limiting in yellow-legged gull eggs. In combination with the results of previous experiments on the same species applying smaller experimental doses or focusing on the postnatal rather than prenatal life stages, our findings indicate that the effects of a physiological increase in the egg concentration of these substances can be life stage and dose specific, implying that generalizing prenatal effects of egg compounds may not be feasible.  2019.

By using stable isotope-labelled testosterone and androstenedione in combination with mass spectrometry, enabling verification of the exact molecular identity of labelled compounds in the embryo, we found that after 5 days of incubation the androgens were not taken up by the embryo. However, their concentrations in the entire yolk albumen homogenates declined strongly, even when corrected for dilution by albumen and water. Our results indicate metabolism of maternal androgens, very likely to 5-androstane-3,17-diol, etiocholanolone and their conjugated forms. The results imply that the effects of increased exposure of the embryo to maternal androgens take place either before this early conversion or are mediated by these metabolites with an as yet unknown function, opening new avenues for understanding hormone-mediated maternal effects in vertebrates.  2019.

Direct predation risk elevates glucocorticoid concentration in the eggs of females, and so indirect predation risk communicated via parental effects may also affect glucocorticoids in the eggs of daughters. Parents may also change their care patterns under predation risk, which could influence the development of the hypothalamuspituitaryadrenal axis (stress axis) of offspring, which is responsible for the secretion of glucocorticoids. Therefore, in systems where males make substantial contributions to offspring care, paternal effects may also affect daughters egg glucocorticoids. Question: Are there predator-induced parental effects (maternal, paternal, or joint parental effects) on the concentration of glucocorticoids in daughters eggs? Organism: Threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from the Chehalis River, Washington, USA. Freshwater and riverine ecotypes. Methods: We exposed threespine stickleback mothers, fathers, both, or neither to a model predator at developmentally appropriate times using a fully factorial design. Control parents experienced no disturbance. Mothers were exposed to a model predator during egg production and fathers were exposed pre-fertilization and during egg care (but before embryos developed eyes). We then tested the concentration of glucocorticoids in the eggs of daughters using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: Daughters of predator-exposed parents (both parents exposed to model predator) had higher glucocorticoid concentrations in their eggs than daughters of control, unexposed parents. Daughters of predator-exposed mothers-only and predator-exposed fathers-only did not differ from controls or jointly predator-exposed parents. Therefore, predator-induced maternal and paternal effects may cumulatively impact the gametes of their daughters, suggesting a mechanism through which predation risk may indirectly influence the next generation (grand-offspring).  2019 Whitley R.

Fertilised eggs were reared to fry and put through a series of aerobic swim trials. Results show that exposure to cortisol early in development reduces maximum oxygen consumption while swimming, and decreases aerobic scope in all three species. Resting oxygen consumption did not differ between cortisol and control treatment groups. We also examined several metrics that could influence aerobic performance, and found no differences between treatment groups in haematocrit%, haemoglobin concentration, heart mass, citrate synthase activity or lactate dehydrogenase activity. Though it was not the focus of this study, an interesting discovery was that pink salmon had a higher MO2max and aerobic scope relative to the other species, which was supported by a greater haematocrit, haemoglobin, a larger heart and higher CS activity. Some management and conservation practices for Pacific salmon focus efforts primarily on facilitating adult spawning. However, if deleterious effects of maternal stress acquired prior to spawning persist into the next generation, consideration will need to be given to sub-lethal effects that could be imparted onto offspring from maternal stress.

Eggs laid in food-supplemented nests had larger yolks and thicker shells independently of predation risk, while eggs laid in nests exposed to predator cues had lower levels of immunoglobulins, independent of food supplementation. In nests without predator cues, shell biliverdin content was higher in eggs laid in food-supplemented nests. Incubation was 1 day shorter in food-supplemented nests and shorter incubation periods were associated with higher hatching success, but there were no direct effects of maternal treatment on hatching success. To investigate the impact of maternal treatment (via egg composition) on the offspring, we performed full brood crossfostering after hatching to unmanipulated nests. Maternal treatment did not significantly affect body mass and immunoglobulin levels of offspring.

Using 24 years of data on age-specific common tern (Sterna hirundo) chick mortality, best described by the Gompertz function, and estimates of energy consumption per age of mortality, we investigated how energy wasted on nonfledged chicks depends on brood size, hatching order, and annual abundance of herring (Clupea harengus), the main food source. We found mortality directly after hatching (Gompertz baseline mortality) to be high and to increase with decreasing herring abundance. Mortality declined with age at a rate relatively insensitive to herring abundance. The sensitivity of baseline mortality to herring abundance reduced energy wasted on nonfledged chicks when herring was in short supply. Among chicks that did not fledge, last-hatched chicks were less costly than earlier-hatched chicks because of their earlier mortality. However, per hatchling produced, the least energy was wasted on chicks without siblings because their baseline mortality was most sensitive to herring abundance. We suggest that earlier mortality of offspring when food is short facilitates economic adjustment of posthatch-ing parental investment to food abundance but that such economic brood reduction may be constrained by sibling competition.  2019 by The University of Chicago."

In birds that produce more than one egg per clutch, females differ in the concentration of components they allocate into the yolk along the laying sequence. However, identification of processes that shape female yolk allocation and thus offspring phenotype still remains a major challenge within evolutionary ecology. A way to increase our understanding is by acknowledging that allocation patterns can differ depending on the level of analysis, such as the population versus the among-female (within-population) level. We employed mixed models to analyze at both levels the variation in allocation along the laying sequence of four steroid hormones, three antioxidants, and four groups of fatty acids present in the egg yolks of wild great tits Parus major. We also quantified repeatabilities for each component to study female consistency. At a population level, the concentrations/proportions of five yolk components varied along the laying sequence, implying that the developmental environment is different for offspring developing in first versus last eggs. Females varied substantially in the mean allocation of components and in their plasticity along the laying sequence. For most components, these two parameters were negatively correlated. Females were also remarkably repeatable in their allocation. Overall, our data emphasize the need to account for female variation in yolk allocation along the laying sequence at multiple levels, as variation at a population level is underpinned by different individual patterns. Our findings also highlight the importance of considering both levels of analysis in future studies investigating the causes and fitness consequences of yolk compounds. Finally, our results on female repeatability confirm that analyzing one egg per nest is a suitable way to address the consequences of yolk resource deposition for the offspring.  2018 The Authors"

We measured F1 body mass, reproduction, and plasma levels of androgens and corticosterone. F1 group housing led to an increase in body mass. In addition, F1 group housing had a positive effect on mass in daughters of pair-housed P0 females only, which were heaviest under mismatched conditions. At the time of egg collection for the F2 generation, F1 group-housed females were heavier, irrespective of the P0 treatment. F1 females in groups laid heavier eggs, with higher hatching success, and produced heavier offspring, most likely a maternal effect of F1 mass. F1 plasma hormones were affected by neither the P0 nor the F1 social environment. These results contrasted with effects in the P0 generation (reported previously), in which plasma hormone levels, but not mass, differed between social environments. This may be due to changes in adult sex ratios as P0 females were housed with males, whereas F1 females encountered males only during mating.

So far the only two studies that experimentally investigated the potential fitness consequences of maternal THs in birds found inconsistent results. More studies are thus required to assess the general effects of maternal THs and their influences on more behavioral and physiological parameters. In this study, we experimentally elevated yolk TH content in a wild migratory passerine species, the collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis, to investigate the effects on hatching success, nestling growth and oxidative stress. We found that TH-injected eggs had a higher hatching success, and the nestlings hatched from TH-injected eggs were heavier and larger than control nestlings, but only during the early postnatal period. These differences vanished by fledging. Nestlings from TH-injected eggs exhibited lower activity of the glutathione-s-transferase, a major antioxidant enzyme, than control nestlings at day 12, a few days before fledging, but they did not differ in oxidative damage and overall intracellular oxidative state. These results suggest that the early growth-enhancing effects incurred no observable oxidative stress. We hypothesize that such a transient growth-enhancing effect might be adaptive in advancing the development and maturation of the offspring so they are well-prepared in time for the upcoming migration. Further studies investigating whether such advancing effects can influence long-term fitness, will be more than valuable.  2018 The Authors"

While the cortical flash is due to the ion influx through L-type Ca2+ channels in starfish eggs, its amplitude was shown to be affected by the integrity of the egg cortex. Here, we investigated the contribution of cortical granules (CG) and yolk granules (YG) to the sperm-induced Ca2+ signals in sea urchin eggs. To this end, prior to fertilization, Paracentrotus lividus eggs were treated with agents that disrupt or relocate CG beneath the plasma membrane: namely, glycyl-L-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide (GPN), procaine, urethane, and NH4Cl. All these pretreatments consistently suppressed the cortical flash in the fertilized eggs, and accelerated the decay kinetics of the subsiding Ca2+ wave in most cases. By contrast, centrifugation of the eggs, which stratifies organelles but not the CG, did not exhibit such changes except that the CF was much enhanced in the centrifugal pole where YG are localized. Surprisingly, we noted that pretreatment of the eggs with these CG-disrupting agents or with the inhibitors of L-type Ca2+ channels all drastically reduced the density of the microvilli and their individual shapes on the egg surface. Taken together, our results suggest that the integrity of the egg cortex ensures successful generation of the Ca2+ responses at fertilization, and that modulation of microvilli shape and density may serve as a mechanism of controlling ion flux across the plasma membrane.

Maternal effects, which can have significant influence over evolutionary processes, are an understudied source of behavioural variation. Maternal effects are not necessarily static, however, since their importance can change over offspring ontogeny, typically declining with age relative to additive genetic effects. Here, using a quantitative genetics approach, we test the prediction that maternal effects will influence age-specific risk-taking behaviour in Trinidadian guppies, Poecilia reticulata. Individuals were subject to a single open-field trial as juveniles and up to four repeat trials as adults, with five traits indicative of risk-taking behaviour measured in each trial. We then partitioned phenotypic variance into additive genetic (VA) and maternal identity (VM) components, in addition to testing brood size and maternal weight as specific sources of maternal effects. We found that VM had significant influence over juvenile traits, with very low VA estimates. Whereas, in adults, all traits were significantly heritable, with little support for VM. We also found a strong influence of maternal traits on juvenile behaviours as predicted, with significant, albeit smaller, effects found in adults. Maternal weight was heritable and itself subject to maternal effects. Thus, maternal weight is a likely source of maternal genetic effects that are expected to alter response to selection on personality in this system. More generally, our study highlights that while maternal effects can be an important source of personality variation, this varies over ontogeny of offspring.  2018, The Author(s)."

Here, we experimentally tested such non-lethal effects of exposure to increased predation risk on clutch size, egg mass, and the concentration of yolk steroid hormones in the yellow-legged gull Larus michahellis. We simulated increased predation risk by displaying stuffed predators (adult fox Vulpes vulpes, and adult buzzard Buteo buteo) to breeding adults before egg laying. The concentration of corticosterone, which has been shown to increase under exposure to maternal predation risk in other species, and of testosterone did not differ between eggs from mothers exposed to the predators and eggs from control mothers (i.e., eggs exposed to a novel object of similar size and position to the stuffed predators). The concentration of the two hormones negatively covaried. Clutch size did not vary according to experimental treatment, whereas egg mass was markedly larger in clutches from nests exposed to predators than in clutches from control nests. By increasing egg mass, mothers may reduce the risk of cooling of the eggs when incubation is impeded by predators, boost energy reserves, reduce post-natal detectability caused by food solicitation, and/ or enhance development at hatching, thus increasing the chances of offspring survival. In general, our results are inconsistent with most of the few previous studies on similar non-lethal predator effects and suggest that such effects may vary among species according to ecological conditions, social behavior, and developmental mode.

To test this hypothesis, we paired roosters from two selection lines, one up- and one down-selected for natural antibodies (NAbs), with hens from a control line. We measured yolk testosterone and androstenedione levels, and we injected the treatment group of eggs of each female with testosterone suspended in sesame oil and the control group with sesame oil only. We then measured hatching success and growth, and characterized the humoral and cellular immune responses using three different challenges: a phyto-hemagglutinin, a lipopolysaccharide and a sheep red blood cell challenge. We found that the hatching success, body mass, initial levels of natural antibodies and the chicks immunological responses to the three different challenges and development were affected neither by paternal immunocompetence nor by treatment. These results do not support the hypothesis that chicks from low-NAb line fathers are more sensitive to testosterone exposure during embryonic development than chicks from high-NAb line fathers.  2019.

Thermal stress in mothers triggered the inhibition of locomotor fear-related responses upon exposure to a novel environment and decreased spatial learning abilities in progeny. Impaired behavioural phenotypes were associated with the dysregulation of several genes known to play major roles in neurodevelopment, including auts2 (autism susceptibility candidate 2), a key gene for neurodevelopment, more specifically neuronal migration and neurite extension, and critical for the acquisition of neurocognitive function. In addition, our analysis revealed the dysregulation of another neurodevelopment gene (dpysl5) as well as genes associated with human cognitive disorders (arv1, plp2). We observed major differences in maternal mRNA abundance in the eggs following maternal exposure to high temperature indicating that some of the observed intergenerational effects are mediated by maternallyinherited mRNAs accumulated in the egg. Together, our observations shed new light on the intergenerational determinism of fish behaviour and associated underlying mechanisms. They also stress the importance of maternal history on fish behavioural plasticity.  2019 Colson et al."

The results showed elevation of triiodothyronine and thyroxine concentrations in oocytes, which were significantly different with plasma and ovarian fluid. Thyroxine concentration of plasma and ovarian fluid revealed a significant negative correlation. The mentioned parameters showed negative correlation with fertilization rate. The biochemical parameters (calcium, glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride) revealed significant differences in blood, ovarian fluid and oocytes. These results showed direct relations of fertilization rate with hormones level.

Results showed significant differences between incubated groups on most of the examined traits. The relative embryonic weight at day 14 of incubation and the hatchability were significantly higher in the FL group than that in the INC group. Average chick weight at hatch and at 6 weeks of age increased significantly with the increase in egg weight under both light sources. Chicks hatched from large eggs under FL light had higher weight gain and feed intake, but the mortality rate of chicks was not affected by the treatments. There was a clear light source  egg weight interaction for the relative embryonic weight, hatchability and embryonic mortality. Higher hatchability and relative embryonic weight were obtained from the small eggs incubated under FL and INC light, respectively, while birds hatched from the large eggs incubated under FL light showed the best weight gain and feed conversion ratio. Furthermore, FL chicks exhibited higher (P0.01) plasma triiodothyronine hormone (T3) level, total protein, albumin, globulin, glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride concentration of embryos than those measured in the INC group. We conclude that higher hatchability and better growth performance during both embryonic life and post-hatch might be attributed to the role of the light source on physiological and metabolic processes.

The neuroimmune response is inextricably linked to the action of the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis. Cytokines released from neuroimmune cells, including microglia, activate the HPA axis, while glucocorticoids in turn regulate cytokine release from microglia. Because of the close links between these two physiological systems, coupled with potential for persistent changes to HPA axis activity following developmental stress, components of the neuroimmune system could be targets for developmental programming. However, little is known of any programming effects of developmental stress on neuroimmune function. We investigated whether developmental stress exposure via elevated prenatal corticosterone (CORT) or postnatal unpredictable food availability had long-term effects on pro- (IL-1) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokine and microglia-dependent gene (CSF1R) expression within HPA axis tissues in a precocial bird, the Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica). Following postnatal stress, we observed increased IL-1 expression in the pituitary gland, reduced IL-10 expression in the amygdala and hypothalamus, and reduced CSF1R expression within the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. Postnatal stress disrupted the ratio of IL-1:IL-10 expression within the hippocampus and hypothalamus. Prenatal stress only increased IL-1 expression in the pituitary gland. We found no evidence for interactive or cumulative effects across life stages on basal cytokine and glia expression in adulthood. We show that postnatal stress may have a larger impact than elevated prenatal CORT on basal immunity in HPA-axis-specific brain regions, with changes in cytokine homeostasis and microglia abundance. These results provide evidence for postnatal programming of a pro-inflammatory neuroimmune phenotype at the expense of reduced microglia, which could have implications for central nervous system health and subsequent neuroimmune responses.  2019.

Although THs are needed from the start of development, the embryonic thyroid gland only matures around mid-incubation in precocial birds and around hatching in altricial species. Therefore, maternal THs deposited in the egg yolk play an essential role in embryonic development. They are taken up by the embryo throughout its development, from the first day till hatching, and expression of TH regulators such as distributor proteins, transporters, and deiodinases in the yolk sac membrane provide the tools for selective metabolism and transport starting from this level. TH receptors and regulators of local TH availability are expressed in avian embryos in a dynamic and tissue/cell-specific pattern from the first stages studied, as shown in detail in chicken. Maternal hyperthyroidism via TH supplementation as well as injection of THs into the egg yolk increase TH content in embryonic tissues while induction of maternal hypothyroidism by goitrogen treatment results in a decrease. Both increase and decrease of maternal TH availability were shown to alter gene expression in early chicken embryos. Knockdown of the specific TH transporter monocarboxylate transporter 8 at early stages in chicken cerebellum, optic tectum, or retina allowed to reduce local TH availability, interfering with gene expression and confirming that development of the central nervous system (CNS) is highly dependent on maternal THs. While some of the effects on cell proliferation, migration and differentiation seem to be transient, others result in persistent defects in CNS structure. In addition, a number of studies in both precocial and altricial birds showed that injection of THs into the yolk at the start of incubation influences a number of parameters in posthatch performance and fitness. In conclusion, the data presently available clearly indicate that maternal THs play an important role in avian embryonic development, but how exactly their influence on cellular and molecular processes in the embryo is linked to posthatch fitness needs to be further explored.

Measurements of the normality of biological functioning, such as plasma, egg albumen and yolk and fecal corticosterone concentrations, and heterophil to lymphocyte ratios, behavioral time budgets, mortality and efficiency of productivity, and measurement of hen preferences, such as choice behavior in Y maze tests, were used to assess hen welfare. There were no effects of treatment on physiological measurements. Hens given less space during adulthood spent less time mobile, inedible pecking, drinking, and preening and spent more time resting and feed pecking and sitting (P &lt; 0.05). Hens with access to a nest box spent more time resting (P = 0.046) and less time sham dust bathing (P = 0.044) than hens without access to a nest box. There were no effects of space allowance on choice behavior for space or a nest box over food; however, hens with access to a nest box chose the nest box over food more than hens without access to a nest box (P = 0.0053). The present experiment provides no convincing evidence that either reducing space allowance in adulthood from 1648 to 542 cm2/bird or eliminating access to a nest box results in disruption of biological function. Less space and no access to a nest box did not increase the choice for more space or a nest box, respectively, over food in the preference tests. However, reduced floor space reduced behavioral freedom and denying access to a nest box eliminated the opportunity for the motivated behavior of laying their eggs in a discrete enclosed nest box, both of which presumably provide hens with the opportunity for positive affective experiences.  2018 Poultry Science Association Inc."

Although climate change may skew sex ratios in species with TSD, few available methods predict sex under natural conditions, fewer still are based on mechanistic hypotheses of development, and field tests of existing methods are rare. We propose a new approach that calculates the probability of masculinization (PM) in natural nests. This approach subsumes the mechanistic hypotheses describing the outcome of TSD, by integrating embryonic development with the temperature-dependent reaction norm for sex determination. Further, we modify a commonly used method of sex ratio estimation, the constant temperature equivalent (CTE), to provide quantitative estimates of sex ratios. We test our new approaches using snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina). We experimentally manipulated nests in the field, and found that the PM method is better supported than the modified CTE, explaining 69% of the variation in sex ratios across 27 semi-natural nests. Next, we used the PM method to predict variation in sex ratios across 14 natural nests over 2 years, explaining 67% of the variation. We suggest that the PM approach is effective and broadly applicable to species with TSD, particularly for forecasting how sex ratios may respond to climate change. Interestingly, we also found that the modified CTE explained up to 64% of variation in sex ratios in a Type II TSD species, suggesting that our modifications will be useful for future research. Finally, our data suggest that the Algonquin Park population of snapping turtles possesses resilience to biased sex ratios under climate change.  2019. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd"

Parentoffspring communication often involves conspicuous begging by the offspring which triggers a parental response, typically the transfer of food. So begging and parental provisioning reciprocally influence each other and are therefore expected to coevolve. There is indeed empirical evidence for covariation of offspring begging and parental provisioning at the phenotypic level. However, whether this reflects genetic correlations of mean levels of behaviors or a covariation of the slopes of offspring demand and parental supply functions (= behavioral plasticity) is not known. The latter has gone rather unnoticeddespite the obvious dynamics of parentoffspring communication. In this study, we measured parental provisioning and begging behavior at two different hunger levels using canaries (Serinus canaria) as a model species. This enabled us to simultaneously study the plastic responses of the parents and the offspring to changes in offspring need. We first tested whether parent and offspring behaviors covary phenotypically. Then, using a covariance partitioning approach, we estimated whether the covariance predominantly occurred at a between-nest level (i.e., indicating a fixed strategy) or at a within-nest level (i.e., reflecting a flexible strategy). We found positive phenotypic covariation of offspring begging and parental provisioning, confirming previous evidence. Yet, this phenotypic covariation was mainly driven by a covariance at the within-nest level. That is parental and offspring behaviors covary because of a plastic behavioral coadjustment, indicating that behavioral plasticity could be a main driver of parentoffspring coadaptation.  2018 The Authors.

However, whether daily feeding times affect reproduction is largely unknown. The present study investigated the effects of daily food availability times on reproductive performance and quality of eggs and offspring survivors in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). In randomly paired birds kept under a 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle for about 52 weeks, food availability period was restricted to 4 h in the morning [morning food availability (FA) group] or evening (evening FA group), with controls provided with food ad libitum; thus, the daily food deprivation period began after 4 h of food availability in the morning food access group and was continuous with night-time starvation in the evening food access group. Both food restrictions adversely affected reproductive health, as shown by reduced sex steroid and mesotocin levels, but not general metabolism, as indicated by the absence of a difference in thyroxin and triiodothyronine levels. Restricting food access to a 4 h period negatively affected reproductive performance, although there were differences between pairs in the morning and evening FA groups. In particular, there was delayed onset of reproduction and compromised reproductive success in evening FA but not in morning FA pairs; conversely, offspring health was severely compromised in morning FA but not in evening FA group pairs. Furthermore, morning FA group females were in better health, implying a sex bias in parental food provisioning. Overall, we demonstrate trade-off of quantity (number of offspring produced and/or survived) for quality (how healthy offspring were) in response to daily food availability times in zebra finches, which, much like humans, are diurnal and retain the ability to reproduce throughout the year.  2019.

However, organisms with environmental sex determination (ESD) are particularly vulnerable to experiencing skewed sex ratios when environmental conditions vary. Theoretical work has modeled sex-ratio dynamics for animals with ESD with regard to 2 traits predicted to be responsive to sex-ratio selection: 1) maternal oviposition behavior and 2) sensitivity of embryonic sex determination to environmental conditions, and much research has since focused on how these traits influence offspring sex ratios. However, relatively few studies have provided estimates of univariate quantitative genetic parameters for these 2 traits, and the existence of phenotypic or genetic covariances among these traits has not been assessed. Here, we leverage studies on 3 species of reptiles (2 turtle species and a lizard) with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) to assess phenotypic covariances between measures of maternal oviposition behavior and thermal sensitivity of the sex-determining pathway. These studies quantified maternal behaviors that relate to nest temperature and sex ratio of offspring incubated under controlled conditions. A positive covariance between these traits would enhance the efficiency of sex-ratio selection when primary sex ratio is unbalanced. However, we detected no such covariance between measures of these categories of traits in the 3 study species. These results suggest that maternal oviposition behavior and thermal sensitivity of sex determination in embryos might evolve independently. Such information is critical to understand how animals with TSD will respond to rapidly changing environments that induce sex-ratio selection.  2019 The American Genetic Association .

Nearly all DBP is produced in the liver, where its regulation is influenced by estrogen, glucocorticoids and inflammatory cytokines but not by Vitamin D itself. DBP is the most polymorphic protein known, and different DBP alleles can have substantial impact on its biologic functions. The three most common allelesGc1f, Gc1s, Gc2differ in their affinity with the Vitamin D metabolites and have been variably associated with a number of clinical conditions. Although DBP has a number of biologic functions independent of Vitamin D, its major biologic function is that of regulating circulating free and total levels of Vitamin D metabolites. 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is the best studied form of Vitamin D as it provides the best measure of Vitamin D status. In a normal non-pregnant individual, approximately 0.03% of 25(OH)D is free; 85% is bound to DBP, 15% is bound to albumin. The free hormone hypothesis postulates that only free 25(OH)D can enter cells. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that mice lacking DBP, and therefore with essentially undetectable 25(OH)D levels, do not show signs of Vitamin D deficiency unless put on a Vitamin D deficient diet. Similar observations have recently been described in a family with a DBP mutation. This hypothesis also applies to other protein bound lipophilic hormones including glucocorticoids, sex steroids, and thyroid hormone. However, tissues expressing the megalin/cubilin complex, such as the kidney, have the capability of taking up 25(OH)D still bound to DBP, but most tissues rely on the free level. Attempts to calculate the free level using affinity constants generated in a normal individual along with measurement of DBP and total 25(OH)D have not accurately reflected directly measured free levels in a number of clinical conditions. In this review, we examine the impact of different clinical conditions as well as different DBP alleles on the relationship between total and free 25(OH)D, using only data in which the free 25(OH)D level was directly measured. The major conclusion is that a number of clinical conditions alter this relationship, raising the question whether measuring just total 25(OH)D might be misleading regarding the assessment of Vitamin D status, and such assessment might be improved by measuring free 25(OH)D instead of or in addition to total 25(OH)D.

Prior work has provided key insights into the top-down hypothalamic control of this seasonal plasticity in T, yet mechanisms acting outside of the brain may also influence circulating T levels. We hypothesized that peripheral mechanisms may be especially critical for females, because peripheral regulation may mitigate the costs of systemically elevated T. Here, we begin to test this hypothesis using a seasonal comparative approach, measuring gene expression in peripheral tissues in tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), a songbird with intense female-female competition and T-mediated aggression. We focused on the gonad and liver for their role in T production and metabolism, respectively, and we contrasted females captured during territory establishment versus incubation. During territory establishment, when T levels are highest, we found elevated gene expression of the hepatic steroid metabolizing enzyme CYP2C19 along with several ovarian steroidogenic enzymes, including the androgenic 5-reductase. Despite these seasonal changes in gene expression along the steroidogenic pathway, we did not observe seasonal changes in sensitivity to upstream signals, measured as ovarian mRNA abundance of luteinizing hormone receptor. Together, these data suggest that differential regulation of steroidogenic gene expression in the ovary is a potentially major contributor to seasonal changes in T levels in females. Furthermore, these data provide a unique and organismal glimpse into tissue-specific gene regulation and its potential role in hormonal plasticity in females.  2018 Elsevier Inc."

In the case of birds, despite growth compensations, nestlings reared under harsh conditions typically show reduced survival chances in adulthood. It has been proposed that environmental early-life stressors could affect longevity via effects on telomere length, possibly mediated through oxidative stress. However, the link between these processes is not clear. In this study, we experimentally manipulated brood size in spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor) to test the causal relationship between early stress, oxidative and corticosterone-mediated stress and telomere shortening. Our results show that experimentally enlarged brood sizes led to a reduction in morphometric development on nestlings, the effect being stronger for females than males. Additionally, basal corticosterone levels increased with increasing brood size in female nestlings. Neither plasma antioxidant status nor malondialdehyde levels (a marker of lipid peroxidation) were affected by experimental brood size, although the levels of a key intracellular antioxidant (glutathione) decreased with increasing brood size. We found that the treatment showed a quadratic effect on nestling telomere lengths: these were shortened either by increases or by decreases in the original brood size. Our study provides experimental evidence for a link between developmental stress and telomere length, but does not support a direct causal link of this reduction with corticosterone or oxidative stress. We suggest that future studies should focus on how telomere length responds to additional markers of allostatic load.  2018 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

However, relatively few studies have focused specifically on the changes in oxidative status and TL that occur immediately after hatching. In this study of the yellow-legged gull Larus michahellis, we found that chicks undergo a marked increase in plasma total antioxidant capacity and a marked decrease in the concentration of pro-oxidant molecules during the first days after hatching. In addition, TL in erythrocytes decreased by 1 standard deviation over the 4 days post-hatching. Body mass and tarsus length covaried with total antioxidant capacity and concentration of pro-oxidants in a complex way, that partly depended on sex and laying order, suggesting that oxidative status can affect growth. Moreover, TL positively covaried with the concentration of pro-oxidant molecules, possibly because retention of high concentrations of pro-oxidant molecules results from mechanisms of prevention of their negative effects, including reduction in TL.

Understanding how variation in immunity drives pathogen transmission among species is especially important for animals that are reservoir hosts for zoonotic pathogens. Bats, in particular, have a propensity to host serious viral zoonoses without developing clinical disease themselves. The immunological adaptations that allow bats to host viruses without disease may be related to their adaptations for flight (e.g., in metabolism and mediation of oxidative stress). A number of analyses report greater richness of zoonotic pathogens in bats than in other taxa, such as birds (i.e., mostly volant vertebrates) and rodents (i.e., nonvolant small mammals), but immunological comparisonsbetween bats and these other taxa are rare. To examine interspecific differences in bacterial killing ability (BKA), a functional measure of overall constitutive innate immunity, we use a phylogenetic meta-analysis to compare how BKA responds to the acute stress of capture and to storage time of frozen samples across the orders Aves and Chiroptera. After adjusting for host phylogeny, sample size, and total microbe colony-forming units, we find preliminary evidence that the constitutive innate immune defense of bats may be more resilient to handling stress and storage time than that of birds. This pattern was also similar when we analyzed the proportion of nonnegative and positive effect sizes per species, using phylogenetic comparative methods. We discuss potential physiological and evolutionary mechanisms by which complement proteins may differ between species orders and suggest future avenues for comparative field studies of immunity between sym-patric bats, birds, and rodents in particular.  2018 by The University of Chicago.

Developmental challenge is known to affect growth, development of several organs, and several physiological mechanisms (such as HPA responsiveness, oxidative stress or immunity), which may altogether affect adult metabolism. All of these developmental effects are likely to be mediated by glucocorticoids, but the impact of developmental glucocorticoid exposure on adult metabolism has rarely been studied and the results are equivocal. In this study, we examined the impact of developmental exposure to corticosterone (CORT, the main avian glucocorticoid hormone) on resting metabolic rate (RMR, measured in thermoneutrality, 25C) and thermoregulatory metabolic rate (TMR, measured in cold challenge conditions, 5C) in the house sparrow. Following experimental administration of CORT at the nestling stage, house sparrows were kept in captivity until adulthood, when their metabolism was measured. We found that post-natal CORT exposure decreased both RMR and TMR in adult sparrows. This CORT-mediated reduction of metabolism was also associated with a reduced overnight body mass loss. Therefore, our results suggest that developmental CORT exposure can orient the phenotype towards an energy-saving strategy, which may be beneficial in a constraining environmental context.  2019.

In this study, we quantified aggressive behaviour in nesting Snares penguins and undertook an egg survival analysis to examine which factors influence egg loss. During 120 h of observation of 50 nests, we recorded a total of 300 aggressive events in which females were repeatedly pecked, bitten and beaten. Aggressive events lasted from less than a minute to up to 55 min (mean 4.6  7.4 min). Single males were the aggressor in 75% of aggressive events and in 50.7% of aggressive events the aggressor was identified as a neighbouring, breeding male. A greater percentage of the small first eggs (34%) were lost than the large second eggs (4%). We found that egg mortality was influenced by 1) whether the other egg within a nest had hatched, 2) who was present at the nest (father, mother or both) and 3) the average duration of aggressive events on the nest. When one egg within a nest had hatched, the other egg had a vastly increased mortality risk irrespective of aggression. However, long, aggressive events directed towards females after their partners had gone foraging, also increased the probability of egg loss. We suggest that the prolonged nest attendance by breeding males well beyond egg laying is in response to the high frequency of aggressive behaviour during this time. Our data show that A-egg losses occur due to intraspecific aggression in this species. Further research is needed to clarify whether aggressive behaviour in breeding crested penguins is modulated by elevated testosterone levels in the males and whether any reproductive benefits accrue to the aggressors.  2019 The Authors.

We compared the amounts of a wide array of gonadal steroids and their metabolites in the yolk of pre-ovulatory follicles with those of freshly laid eggs of rock pigeons using mass spectrometry.

Moreover, it is unknown whether embryos can adjust their metabolic activity to, for example, hormones or other maternal signals. We studied the dynamics of maternal steroids in fertilized and unfertilized rock pigeon eggs during early incubation. Embryos of this species are naturally exposed to different amounts of maternal steroids in the egg according to their laying position, which provides a natural context to study differential embryonic regulation of the maternal signals. We used mass spectrometric analyses to map changes in the androgen and estrogen pathways of conversion. We show that the active hormones are heavily metabolized only in fertilized eggs, with a corresponding increase in supposedly less potent metabolites already within one-fourth of total incubation period. Interestingly, the rate of androgen metabolism was different between embryos in different laying positions. The results also warrant a re-interpretation of the timing of hormone mediated maternal effects and the role of the supposedly biologically inactive metabolites. Furthermore, the results also provide a potential solution as to how the embryo can prevent maternal steroids in the egg from interfering with its sexual differentiation processes as we show that the embryo can metabolize most of the maternal steroids before sexual differentiation starts.  2018 Elsevier Inc."

This can limit our understanding of how thermally sensitive species respond to ecologically relevant temperatures. Research on turtles with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) provides good examples of this, since nest temperatures from many populations rarely exceed those necessary to produce females under constant laboratory conditions. We hypothesized that exposure to brief periods of warm temperatures (i.e., heat waves) are integral to sex determination in species with TSD, which requires tests that move beyond constant temperatures. We exposed Trachemys scripta embryos from multiple populations and across the nesting season to heat waves of variable durations and quantified sex ratios. We found that embryos from all populations were highly sensitive to brief exposures to female producing temperatures; only 7.9 days of exposure produced a 50:50 sex ratio, but the response varied across the nesting season. From these findings, a model was developed to estimate sex ratios from field temperature traces, and this model outperformed traditional methods. Overall, these results enhance our understanding of TSD and emphasize the importance of using biologically relevant temperatures when studying thermally sensitive processes.  2017 The Author(s)."

Attaining and maintaining a high dominance status in a population of competing individuals is physiologically costly for males. But how male dominance status is mediated by maintenance energetics is currently not well understood, nor are the corresponding effects of male energetics on his sisters recognized. We conducted laboratory and field experiments on rodent populations to test whether selective breeding for male dominance status (dominant vs. subordinate breeding lines) antagonistically affected basal metabolic rate (BMR) and fitness of females under wild conditions. Our results showed elevated BMR in females, but not in males, from the dominant breeding line. However, phenotypically dominant males from the subordinate breeding line had the highest BMR. Males from the dominant line with low BMR sired the most litters and offspring in the field. Similarly, females from the dominant selection line tended to have more offspring if they had lower BMR, while the opposite trend was found in females from the subordinate selection line. Females with high and low BMR reproduced most often, as indicated by a significant quadratic selection gradient. The increased female BMR resulting from selection for male dominance suggests genetic incompatibility between sexes in metabolism inheritance. Elevated BMR in behaviourally dominant males, but not in males from the dominant breeding line, suggests physiological costs in males not genetically suited for dominance. Fitness costs of elevated maintenance costs (measured as BMR) shown here support the energetic compensation hypothesis where high BMR is selected against as it would trade off energy required for other important life-history attributes.

The strongest predictors of variation in study outcomes are host thermoregulation and the methods used to evaluate body condition.

This research has identified offspring traits that are labile in response to maternal stress; however, an understanding of the mechanisms underlying these effects is lagging and is crucial to appreciating the significance of this maternal effect. In the present study, we sought to better understand maternal stress effects by examining the potential for embryonic regulation of corticosterone exposure, determining the phenotypic consequences of elevated corticosterone during development, and characterizing the levels of maternally transferred corticosterone in unmanipulated eggs using Trachemys scripta. By dosing eggs with tritiated corticosterone and tracking the steroid throughout development, we found that most corticosterone is metabolized, and less than 1% of the corticosterone dose reaches the embryo as free corticosterone. We also found that exogenous dosing of corticosterone, in concentrations sufficient to overwhelm embryonic metabolism, reduces embryonic survival and negatively impacts hatchling traits important to fitness. Our results demonstrate that concentrations of maternal corticosterone in the yolks of unmanipulated eggs are low and are significantly lower than the doses of corticosterone required to elicit phenotypic effects in hatchlings. Taken together, these results provide evidence that both the embryo and the female may minimize corticosterone accumulation in the embryo to avoid reductions in embryonic survival and negative impacts on offspring phenotype and fitness.  2018 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd."

Interpreting biomedical findings within an ecological context has posited that maternal stress, mediated by elevations of maternal GCs, may play an adaptive role preparing offspring for a stressful or rigorous environment. Yet, the influence of maternal stress on offspring phenotype has been little studied in wild animals. We experimentally elevated GCs to ecologically relevant levels (mimicking increases in maternal stress hormones following a nonlethal predator encounter, a heat challenge, or a chasing or confinement stressor) in female eastern fence lizards Sceloporus undulatus during gestation. We tested the hypothesis that maternally derived stress hormones themselves are sufficient to alter offspring phenotype. Specifically, we examined the effects of experimentally elevated maternal GCs on fitness-relevant traits of the mother, her eggs and her subsequent offspring. We found that daily maternal GC elevation: (a) increased maternal antipredator behaviours and postlaying glucose levels; (b) had no effect on egg morphology or caloric value, but altered yolk hormone (elevated GC) and nutrient content; and (c) altered offspring phenotype including stress-relevant physiology, morphology and behaviour. These findings reveal that maternally derived GCs alone can alter offspring phenotype in a wild animal, changes that may be mediated via maternal behaviour, and egg hormone and nutrient content. Understanding the ecological consequences of these effects under different environmental conditions will be critical for determining the adaptive significance of elevated maternal GCs for offspring.  2018 The Authors.

However, mature female fish have higher levels of circulating cortisol levels, and this is particularly telling in salmonids during their spawning migration. This raises the possibility that a cortisol buffering capacity is active at the level of the gonad. This is particularly important given the recent findings in zebrafish (Danio rerio, Cyprinidae) that zygotic cortisol content, either high or low, can alter developmental programming. Therefore, a tight regulation of corticosteroid during oogenesis may be essential for proper ovarian development. Here, we focus on the temporal dynamics of cortisol in the ovary and its role in regulating the different processes related to oogenesis. Maternally deposited cortisol along with the local production of this steroid by the ovary may be involved in the regulation of oogenesis. We propose two critical stages when cortisol may exert a modulatory effect on oogenesis. The first stage occurs during vitellogenesis when maternal cortisol is incorporated into the yolk, and the second is during maturation and ovulation when cortisol may have a regulatory role on the action of maturation-inducing hormones. A key protective mechanism to prevent excess cortisol deposition appears to be the upregulation of 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 in the theca and/or granulosa cells of the developing oocyte in response to excess maternal cortisol stimulation. Taken together, cortisol dynamics during oogenesis is complex, but maintaining a Goldilocks concentration of this steroid may be a critical process governing successful spawning and progeny development.  2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

However, relatively little is known about the effect of contaminants on incubation temperature (T inc ) in wild birds. By using temperature thermistors placed into artificial eggs, we investigated whether the most contaminated parent birds are less able to provide appropriate egg warming and thus less committed to incubating their clutch. Specifically, we investigated the relationships among 3 groups of contaminants (organochlorines, perfluoroalkyl substances [PFASs], and mercury [Hg]) with T inc and also with prolactin concentrations and brood patch size in incubating Arctic black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla). Our results reveal that among the organochlorines considered, only blood levels of oxychlordane, the main metabolite of chlordane, a banned pesticide, were negatively related to the minimum incubation temperature in male kittiwakes. Levels of PFASs and Hg were unrelated to T inc in kittiwakes. Moreover, our study suggests a possible underlying mechanism: since we reported a significant and negative association between blood oxychlordane concentrations and the size of the brood patch in males.

Theory predicts that competition between adult females should be especially context-dependent, because of constraints imposed by high costs of reproduction. However, the potential impact of developmental environments on competition in adult females remains little understood. In Drosophila melanogaster, the developmental environment can strongly influence adult condition, and prime adult competitive behaviour. In this species, femalefemale aggression is dependent on reproductive state and increases after mating due to the receipt of sperm and seminal fluid components. However, the effects of the developmental environment on adult female aggression, and any potential interactions with mating status, are unknown. To address this problem, we first raised flies at low and high larval density, which altered competition over limited resources, produced large and small adult females, respectively, and potentially primed them for differing levels of adult competition. We then fought the resulting adult females, either as virgins, or after receiving aggression-stimulating ejaculates at mating, to test for interacting effects. We found, as expected, that mating elevated contest duration. However, this mating-induced boost in aggression was strongly exacerbated for high density (small) females. Low density (large) females won more contests overall, but were not more successful in fights after mating. In contrast, mating increased the fighting success in females raised in high density environments. Our results suggest that individuals who experience competitive, resource-limited, rearing conditions are more sensitive to the aggression-stimulating effects of the male ejaculate. This finding highlights the importance of the developmental environment in mediating adult social interactions and provides support for the theory that femalefemale aggression should be highly context-dependent.

Here, we tested for temporal matching to seasonal changes in the environmental temperatures with toad-headed lizard, Phrynocephalus przewalskii, which inhabits the temperate desert steppe of China.

Eggs from early-breeding females were with higher quality than those from late-breeding females, likely due to better maternal provisioning. Offspring from early-breeding females had higher selected body temperatures and metabolic rates than those from late-breeding females. Falling temperatures that may indicate the end of the growing season, reduced incubation duration and increased metabolic rates for both early and late eggs, compared to rising temperatures. Late hatchlings had higher growth rates when incubated at falling compared to rising temperatures, while growth rates of early hatchlings were not sensitive to incubation temperature. Thus, growth and survival rates of late embryos were similar to early embryos under falling temperatures, despite early embryos being of generally higher quality. Overall, our study confirms that early is higher quality. Intrinsic factors dominate offspring performance and fitness, with a general advantage for early embryos throughout the season. We found some support for temporal matching, demonstrating that late embryos with lower quality have physiological strategies that are specialized to late-season environments, allowing them to attain similar fitness in late-season environments to that of early embryos.

As a consequence, urban wildlife is exposed to high concentrations of MTEs, which exposure is linked to reproductive impairments. MTE effects on reproduction outputs might result from MTE exposure disrupting the endocrine pathways involved in reproductive behaviours. In birds, there is strong evidence that prolactin, corticosterone and testosterone are all involved in the regulation of parental effort during incubation and chick rearing. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals might stimulate or inhibit the production of those hormones and consequently alter parental investment and reproductive success outcomes. We measured baseline corticosterone, prolactin and testosterone plasma levels, and the corticosterone stress response of breeding feral pigeons (Columba livia) experimentally exposed to ecologically relevant lead and/or zinc concentrations. Independently of lead and/or zinc exposure, male and female plasma levels of corticosterone and prolactin (but not testosterone) showed temporal variations along the reproduction stages (i.e. incubation, early rearing and late rearing). In addition, both hatching and fledging success were slightly correlated with corticosterone, prolactin and testosterone levels. However, our study did not find any influence of lead or zinc exposure on hormone levels, suggesting that MTE effects on reproductive outputs might not be explained by MTE-induced modifications of corticosterone, prolactin and testosterone-linked behaviours during incubation and rearing. Alternatively, MTE-induced reproductive impairments might result from MTE exposure having direct effects on offspring phenotypes or prenatal indirect effects on the embryo (e.g. maternal transfer of MTEs, hormones or immune compounds).  2018 Elsevier Inc."

The social conditions experienced by parents at the time of reproduction can predict the social environments that offspring will face. Despite clear challenges in predicting future environmental conditions, adaptive maternal effects provide a mechanism of passing environmental information from parent to offspring and are now considered pervasive in natural systems. Maternal effects have been widely studied in vertebrates, especially in the context of social environment, and are often mediated by steroid hormone (SH) deposition to eggs. In insects, although many species dramatically alter phenotype and life-history traits in response to social density, the mechanisms of these alterations, and the role of hormone deposition by insect mothers into their eggs, remains unknown. In the experiments described here, we assess the effects of social environment on maternal hormone deposition to eggs in house crickets (Acheta domesticus). Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that variable deposition of ecdysteroid hormones (ESH) to eggs is affected by both maternal (a) social density and (b) social composition. We found that while maternal hormone deposition to eggs does not respond to social composition (sex ratio), it does reflect social density; females provision their eggs with higher ESH doses under low-density conditions. This finding is consistent with the interpretation that variable ESH provisioning is an adaptive maternal response to social environment and congruent with similar patterns of variable maternal provisioning across the tree of life. Moreover, our results confirm that maternal hormone provisioning may mediate delayed density dependence by introducing a time lag in the response of offspring phenotype to population size.  2018 The Authors.

Here, we hypothesize that inbreeding-environment interactions that occur early in life have long-term physiological effects, in particular on the adult oxidative balance. We applied a unique experimental design to manipulate early life conditions of inbred and outbred songbirds (Serinus canaria) that allowed us to separate prenatal and postnatal components of early life conditions and their respective importance in inbreeding-environment interactions.We measured a wide variety of markers of oxidative status in adulthood, resulting in a comprehensive account for oxidative balance. Using a Bayesian approach with Markov chain Monte Carlo, we found clear sex-specific effects and we also found only in females small yet significant long-term effects of inbreeding-environment interactions on adult oxidative balance. Postnatal components of early life conditions were most persuasively reflected on adult oxidative balance, with inbred females that experienced disadvantageous postnatal conditions upregulating enzymatic antioxidants in adulthood. Our study provides some evidence that adult oxidative balance can reflect inbreeding-environment interactions early in life, but given the rather small effects that were limited to females, we conclude that oxidative stress might have a limited role asmechanism underlying inbreeding-environment interactions.

Among these, testosterone can upregulate the bioavailability of certain antioxidants but simultaneously promotes the production of pro-oxidants, leading to an oxidative stress situation, which is one of the main forces causing telomere attrition However, no study has investigated the role of this androgen on telomere dynamics in birds and little is known about the effects of yolk testosterone on oxidative status in early-life of these species. We physiologically increased the levels of yolk testosterone by in ovo injections in yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) to evaluate the effects induced by this androgen on hatchlings plasma total antioxidant capacity, amount of pro-oxidant molecules and telomere length at hatching. Testosterone supplementation did not increase hatchling body growth, did not result in the overproduction of pro-oxidant molecules nor a reduction of antioxidant capacity. Accordingly, telomere length at hatching was not affected by testosterone treatment, although hatchlings from the third-laid eggs showed shorter telomeres than their siblings from first-and secondlaid eggs, independently of testosterone treatment. Our results suggest that injection of physiological levels of testosterone does not induce oxidative stress to hatchlings and, consequently do not affect telomere dynamics during early post-natal periods.  2018 Parolini et al.

I used the results of a field study of Australian pelicans (Pelecanus conspicillatus) and a literature review to test whether parentally induced conflict between offspring leads to brood reduction among pelicans generally. The field study showed that parentally induced hatching asynchrony and aggression between siblings were key determinants of brood reduction in Australian pelicans, which occurred in 49% of nests. The literature review showed that hatching asynchrony occurred in all pelican species. However, the incidence of brood reduction varied greatly, from 100% in some populations of brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis) to 0% in Dalmatian pelicans (Pelecanus crispus), demonstrating under-appreciated variation in the incidence of brood reduction among pelicans. This variation in the incidence of brood reduction corresponded to the incidence of sibling aggression, suggesting that, in some circumstances, pelican nestlings might be able to overcome parentally induced inequities attributable to hatching asynchrony.  2018 The Linnean Society of London."

We studied the interactive effects between nonbreeding conditions and a male white wing patch on the breeding success of breeding pairs and the local survival of females in a migratory passerine population over a 32-year period. After dry winters, females paired with large-patched males were more likely to survive than those paired with small-patched males, and vice versa after moist winters. Moreover, after dry winters, large-patched males succeeded in attracting females that laid large clutches, while small-patched males bred with females that laid small clutches, and vice versa after moist winters. This phenomenon led to a difference in fledgling numbers only during years with dry winters and high precipitation during the breeding season. The selection on this male trait and its signaling value to females thus depended on a complex interaction between conditions both at the nonbreeding and breeding grounds. We show that it is important to consider conditions during the nonbreeding season when examining the effects of sexual ornaments on fitness.  2018 The Author(s).

Although many species in this group show temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), recent evidence suggests additional genetic or epigenetic effects. A proposed model explaining the adaptive significance and evolution of TSD in short-lived agamids predicts that selection will favor temperature-biased sex ratios in species with intense male-male competition. Here, we use experimental incubation at (near) constant temperatures to test whether the sex of Australian painted dragons (Ctenophorus pictus) is influenced by temperature, building on previous research yet to have reached an agreement regarding the role of temperature in this species. In this study, incubation temperature and parental identity affected hatchling sex suggesting that environment and genetics may work in concert to determine sex in this species. Although our results are consistent with TSD, our data cannot rule out a temperature-by-sex effect on egg or hatchling mortality.

Specifically, because antiparasitic strategies involve behaviours that have been shown to be hormonally regulated in other contexts, we hypothesize that host responses to brood parasites are likely to be mediated by related endocrine mechanisms. We outline the hallmarks of the endocrine bases of parasite defence-related avian behaviours, review the current understanding of antiparasitic host tactics and propose testable hypotheses about the hormonal mechanisms that May mediate host defences. We consider these mechanisms in a life-history framework and discuss how endocrine factors May shape variation in host defences. By providing a hypothesis-driven mechanistic framework for defences against parasitism, this perspective should stimulate the study of their endocrine bases to enhance our understanding of the intricate arms races in avian hostparasite systems.  2018 The Author(s)."

Feed restriction can potentially affect not only nutrient supply to the embryo but stress hormone levels within the hen. This study investigated the impact of nutrient restriction of the breeder hen on growth rate and immune responses in the progeny with the objective to measure the impact of feed restriction of broiler breeder hens on growth and immune response of the progeny. Broiler breeder hens were feed restricted from 24 wk of age and maintained at three bodyweights; 3.4, 3.6, and 4.0 kg until 43 wk of age and behavioral and physiological measures of stress recorded. Chicks were hatched from each hen treatment and at day 7 vaccinated for infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and at 16, 18, and 20 d old given an immune challenge of lipopolysaccharide. Growth and immune responses of these birds were then recorded. Sex ratio was affected by hen bodyweight, with a significantly increased proportion of males hatched from heavy hens. Growth rate from 35 to 42 d of age was reduced in male progeny from low bodyweight hens. Female progeny from heavy hens responded to an immune challenge by reduced live weight and increased heterophil: lymphocyte ratio, suggesting a more robust immune response in these birds than in the progeny from lower bodyweight hens. Overall, progeny from heavy hens had increased antibodies at day 35 to the vaccination of IBV compared with progeny of low bodyweight hens, also suggesting an improved immune response in these birds. Breeder hens restricted to the lowest feed level showed behaviors indicative of increased stress (object pecking) and an increased heterophil: lymphocyte ratio. Feed restriction of broiler breeder hens increased indices of stress in hens and resulted in offspring that have reduced growth rate and immune response in a sex-dependent way.  The Author(s) 2018."

There are ever increasing examples of both invertebrate and vertebrate TGIP, which go beyond classical examples of maternal antibody transfer. Here we critically summarize the current evidence for TGIP in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Mechanisms underlying TGIP remain elusive in many systems, but while it is unlikely that they are conserved across the range of organisms with TGIP, recent insight into epigenetic modulation may challenge this view. We place TGIP into a framework of evolutionary ecology, discussing costs and relevant environmental variation. We highlight how the ecology of species or populations should affect if, where, when, and how TGIP is realized.

Several analytical methods using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) and tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS) have previously been developed to measure THs, especially in humans. For biomedical and toxicological research using small animal models, and in ecophysiological research using wild species where sample volume is limiting, sensitive methods are needed. In this study, we developed a nano-LC-MS/MS method enabling quantification of low concentrations of two key THs, thyroxine (T4) and 3,3,5-triiodothyronine (T3). The method was tested with egg yolk samples. We used a low flow rate (300 nl/min) to obtain maximal sensitivity of the method. The limit of quantitation was 10.6 amol for T4 and 17.9 amol for T3. The method shows good linearity (r > 0.99), repeatability and reproducibility (CVs <10%). We also reanalyzed yolk samples with radioimmunoassay for a comparison of the newly developed and previously used methods. Finally, we applied the methodology to measure hormones in egg yolk extracts in multiple avian species, and report interesting variation in maternal TH deposition. The newly developed nano-LC-MS/MS method is thus suitable for measuring THs in low concentrations and across species.  2018 Elsevier B.V."

Even though the physiological mechanisms behind such defences can offer important insights into the evolutionary relationship between brood parasites and hosts, they have received little attention so far. Hormones play a critical role in the regulation of bird reproduction, which make them a key element when investigating the physiological effects of brood parasitism on hosts. Here, we experimentally parasitized Eurasian blackbird (Turdus merula) nests with non-mimetic eggs to study its impact on the hormonal levels (corticosterone and prolactin) of females during incubation, as well as the magnitude of the response to the standardized stress protocol in parasitized and non-parasitized individuals. Parasitized females had higher baseline corticosterone levels and showed a poorer body condition than non-parasitized birds, while we found no differences for prolactin levels. Both parasitized and non-parasitized females responded to the standardized-stress protocol with a significant increase in corticosterone levels. However, the decrease in prolactin after the standardized stress protocol was significantly more pronounced in parasitized individuals. Our results suggest that the presence of a non-mimetic parasitic egg involves a stressful situation for hosts, negatively affecting the physical state of parasitized females. Unaffected prolactin levels of parasitized individuals could explain the absence of nest desertion found in this species in response to parasitism. Finally, both hormones were not correlated in blackbirds, confirming that their combined study provides valuable pieces of information on the endocrine mechanisms underlying behavioural responses in animals, including hosts of brood parasites. Significance statement: Physiological mechanisms behind avian brood parasitism remain unclear. In this study, we assessed the effect of experimental parasitism on the hormonal profiles of hosts. We found that the presence of a non-mimetic egg in the nest modified baseline corticosterone levels, but not prolactin levels, of parasitized females and negatively impacted their body condition. Moreover, experimental parasitism affected the prolactin response to stress. These results expand previous information on the endocrine consequences of brood parasitism at other stages of the breeding cycle (nestling and fledgling stage) and might shed light on the hormonal mechanisms that underlie the host response against parasitic eggs.  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

This differential allocation (DA) is highly dependent on exactly how partner quality affects reproductive costs and offspring benefits. We present a stochastic dynamic model of DA in which females care for a series of clutches when mated with males of different quality. In each reproductive event, females choose the size and number of offspring. We find that if partner quality affects reproductive costs, then DA in total reproductive investment occurs only via changes in the number of offspring. DA in the optimal size of the offspring occurs only if partner quality affects the offspring benefit function. This is mostly in the form of greater female investment per offspring as male quality decreases. Simultaneously, we find that adaptive DA increases the number of offspring, and thus the amount of total investment, as male quality increases. Only certain model scenarios produce the positive DA in offspring size seen in empirical studies, providing a predictive framework for DA and how partner quality affects reproductive costs and offspring benefits.  2018 The Authors.

However, less is understood about the strength and frequency of hormone mediated nongenetic parental effects across more than one generation of descendants, and in nonmodel systems. Here we show that the concentration of active ecdysteroid hormones provided by a female house cricket (Acheta domesticus) affects the growth rate of her offspring. We also reveal that variation in the active ecdysteroid hormones provided by a female house cricket to her eggs derives primarily from the quality of nutrition available to her maternal grandmother, regardless of genetic background. This finding is in stark contrast to most previous work that documents a decline in the strength of environmentally based parental effects with each passing generation. Strong grandparental effects may be adaptive under predictable, cyclical changes in the environment.

Despite a growing number of studies involving experimental manipulation of these hormones, little is known about the impact of methodological differences among experiments on the final results expressed as offspring traits. Using a meta-analytical approach and a representative sample of experimental studies performed on birds, we tested the effect of two types of direct hormonal manipulations: manipulation of females (either by implantation of hormone pellets or injection of hormonal solutions) and manipulation of eggs by injection. In both types of manipulation we looked at the effects of two groups of hormones: corticosterone and androgens in the form of testosterone and androstenedione. We found that the average effect on offspring traits differed between the manipulation types, with a well-supported positive effect of egg manipulation and lack of a significant effect of maternal manipulation. The observed average positive effect for egg manipulation was driven mainly by androgen manipulations, while corticosterone manipulations exerted no overall effect, regardless of manipulation type. Detailed analyses revealed effects of varying size and direction depending on the specific offspring traits; e.g., egg manipulation positively affected physiology and behaviour (androgens), and negatively affected future reproduction (corticosterone). Effect size was negatively related to the dose of androgen injected into the eggs, but unrelated to timing of manipulation, offspring developmental stage at the time of measuring their traits, solvent type, the site of egg injection and maternal hormone delivery method. Despite the generally acknowledged importance of maternal hormones for offspring development in birds, the overall effect of their experimental elevation is rather weak, significantly heterogeneous and dependent on the hormone and type of manipulation. We conclude by providing general recommendations as to how hormonal manipulations should be performed in order to standardize their impact and the results achieved.

Exposure to elevated levels of corticosterone during development can profoundly alter offspring behaviour and physiology, but the effects of elevated maternal corticosterone on offspring development remain poorly understood. We tested two competing hypotheses concerning the effect of maternally derived corticosterone on growth and development of free-living house wrens: (i) elevated maternal corticosterone causes damaging effects on nestling phenotype and fitness (collateral damage hypothesis) and (ii) increased maternal corticosterone enhances offspring fitness by preparing nestlings for the environment experienced by their mother (environmental/maternal-matching hypothesis). We used a non-invasive means to increase maternal corticosterone by providing females with corticosterone-injected mealworms prior to and during egg production in the absence of any overt pre-natal maternal stress. To disentangle pre- and post-natal effects of this elevation in maternal corticosterone, we cross-fostered young in two experiments: (i) nestlings of control and experimental females were reared by unmanipulated, natural females in a uniform maternal environment; (ii) a split-brood design that enabled us to assess the interaction between the mothers corticosterone treatment and that of the nestlings. There were significant pre-natal effects of increased maternal corticosterone on nestling growth and survival. Offspring of females experiencing experimentally increased corticosterone were heavier and larger than offspring of control females. There also was a significant interaction between maternal corticosterone treatment and the corticosterone treatment to which young were exposed within the egg in their effect on nestling survival while in the nest; experimental young exhibited greater survival than control young, but only when reared by control mothers. There was also a significant effect of maternal corticosterone treatment on nestling stress reactivity and, in both experiments, on the eventual recruitment of offspring as breeding adults in the local population. These patterns are broadly consistent with the environmental/maternal-matching hypothesis, and highlight the importance of disentangling pre- and post-natal effects of manipulations of maternal hormone levels on offspring phenotype.

Understanding the mechanisms mediating the resolution of such conflict is a major aim in behavioral ecology. Most empirical work on familial conflict has focused on birds. Here, we highlight how recent work on insects provides new and exciting insights into how such conflict is resolved. This work shows that conflict resolution can be more complex than traditionally envisioned, often involving multiple mechanisms. For example, it shows that the resolution of sexual conflict involves a combination of behavioral negotiation, direct assessment of partner's state, and manipulation using anti-aphrodisiacs or prenatal maternal effects. Furthermore, it highlights that there is a shift from the traditional emphasis on conflict (and competition) to a greater emphasis on the balance between conflict on the one hand and cooperation on the other.  2018 Elsevier Inc."
"Cantarero2018","Nestling sex ratio is associated with both male and female attractiveness in rock sparrows","Cantarero, A. and Pilastro, A. and Griggio, M.","Journal of Avian Biology","09088857","49","8",NA,"2018","Blackwell Publishing Ltd","10.1111/jav.01666","According to theory, in species in which male variance in reproductive success exceeds that of the females, sons are more costly to produce; females mated with high quality males or those in better condition should produce more sons. In monogamous species, however, the variance in the reproductive success of the two sexes is often similar and mate choice is often mutual, making predictions regarding sex allocation more difficult. In the rock sparrow Petronia petronia, both males and females have a sexually selected yellow patch on the breast, whose size correlates with individual body condition. We investigated whether the brood sex ratio co-varies with the size of the yellow patch of the father and the mother in a sample of 173 broods (818 chicks) over 8 breeding seasons. While the size of the yellow patch of the mother and the father did not predict per se a deviation from the expected 1:1 sex ratio, brood sex ratios were predicted by the interaction of male and female yellow patch size. This result is surprising, as the ornament is sexually selected by both males and females as an indicator of quality in both sexes and should therefore be inherited by all offspring irrespective of their sex. It indirectly suggests that other sex-specific traits associated with patch size (e.g. polygyny in males and fecundity in females) may explain the sex allocation bias observed in rock sparrows. Thus, female individual quality alone, as expressed through the size of the yellow patch, was not associated with the biases in sex ratios reported in this study. Our results rather suggest that sex allocation occurs in response to male attractiveness in interaction with female attractiveness. In other words, females tend to preferentially allocate towards the sex of the parent with more developed ornament within the pair.  2018 The Authors"

As a result, birth is not an adequate starting point for explanations of behavioral development. However, surprisingly little is currently known regarding the role of prenatal experience in the emergence and facilitation of perceptual, cognitive, or social development. Our lack of knowledge in this area is due in part to the very restricted experimental manipulations possible with human fetuses. A comparative approach utilizing animal models provides an essential step in addressing this gap in our knowledge and providing testable predictions for studies with human fetuses, infants, and children. Further, animal-based comparative research serves to minimize the amount of exploratory research undertaken with human subjects and hone in on issues and research directions worthy of further research investment. In this article, I review selected animal-based research exploring how developmental influences during the prenatal period can guide and constrain subsequent behavioral and social development. I then discuss the importance of linking the prenatal environment to postnatal outcomes in terms of how psychologists conceptualize innate biases, preferences, and skills in the study of human development.

Middle-aged mothers allocated more of these substances to yolk compared to young and old mothers. These results can be explained through differences in age-specific foraging, absorption or deposition patterns of carotenoids and vitamins into yolk.

There is also a growing body of empirical work, within ecology and evolution, indicating that maternal GCs link the environment experienced by the mother during gestation with changes in offspring phenotype. These changes are considered to be adaptive if the maternal environment matches the offspring's environment and maladaptive if it does not. While these ideas are conceptually sound, we lack a testable framework that can be used to investigate the fitness costs and benefits of altered offspring phenotypes across relevant future environments. We present error management theory as the foundation for a framework that can be used to assess the adaptive potential of maternal stress hormones on offspring phenotype across relevant postnatal scenarios. To encourage rigorous testing of our framework, we provide field-testable hypotheses regarding the potential adaptive role of maternal stress across a diverse array of taxa and life histories, as well as suggestions regarding how our framework might provide insight into past, present, and future research. This perspective provides an informed lens through which to design and interpret experiments on the effects of maternal stress, provides a framework for predicting and testing variation in maternal stress across and within taxa, and also highlights how rapid environmental change that induces maternal stress may lead to evolutionary traps.  2018 The Authors.

Plasticity may occur in response to the environment experienced during an individual's lifetime or to the environment experienced by parents (transgenerational plasticity), and may be adaptive if it enhances fitness. In particular, plasticity in thermal traits, such as preferred temperatures and thermal limits, may improve performance and fitness based on temperatures in the local environment. This study examined the influence of parental and offspring thermal environments (duration of access to a basking lamp) on offspring thermal traits (preferred temperatures and panting threshold) in jacky dragons (Agamidae: Amphibolurus muricatus). Long-bask parental environments led, indirectly, to higher preferred temperatures of offspring due to increased offspring body mass compared to offspring of short-bask parents. The increase in median temperature preference was associated with a higher voluntary minimum body temperature and a narrower preference range, suggesting tradeoffs in thermal behavior and a matching of offspring preferences to the parental environment. Parental thermal treatment did not influence offspring panting threshold. Instead, the panting threshold tended to be higher in offspring that were reared in the long-bask treatment compared to those in the short-bask treatment, suggesting longer basking environments increased thermal tolerance. Parental and offspring thermal environment did not exhibit any interactive effect on thermal traits. The results indicate that thermal environments experienced by lizards can have both transgenerational and within-generation impacts on thermal traits, thus influencing how populations respond to fluctuating or changing climates.  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Both daily and annual variation in the glucocoriticoid hormones (specifically corticosterone, or CORT, in birds) helps provide the variable energy needed through life history stages. In many bird species, CORT is higher in the breeding season when energy demands can be quite high and is often lower in the non-breeding season. Additionally, CORT has a role to play in the response to stressful stimuli and the level to which CORT is elevated following stressful events can vary through the annual cycle as well. Here we report on baseline and stress-induced CORT levels in both sexes of northern cardinals, Cardinalis cardinalis, a non-migrating, year-round territorial species across life history stages. Corticosterone is overall higher in the non-breeding season than the breeding season in both sexes. Males tend to have higher levels of stress-induced CORT than females, although the observed patterns are complex. Our findings differ from one of the more common profile reported in songbirds where breeding season CORT tends to be higher than non-breeding levels. A strong influence may be the prolonged breeding season seen in cardinals; lower levels of CORT during breeding may guard against adverse maternal effects, interruptions in breeding behaviors, or egg production. Additional investigation of species with similar ecologies to northern cardinals, and more populations of cardinals, may show that annual glucocorticoid profiles are more labile than previously appreciated.  2018 Elsevier Inc."

These prenatal maternal effects are often found to be sex-specific and may have evolved as adaptations, maximizing fitness of male and female offspring for their future environment. Female hormone levels during reproduction are considered a potential mechanism regulating sex allocation in vertebrates: high maternal androgens have repeatedly been linked to increased investment in sons, whereas high glucocorticoid levels are usually related to increased investment in daughters. However, results are not consistent across studies and therefore still inconclusive. In Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), we previously found that pair-housed females had higher plasma androgen levels and tended to have higher plasma corticosterone levels than group-housed females. In the current study we investigate whether these differences in maternal social environment and physiology affect offspring sex allocation and physiology. Counter to our expectations, we find no effects of the maternal social environment on offspring sex ratio, sex-specific mortality, growth, circulating androgen or corticosterone levels. Also, maternal corticosterone or androgen levels do not correlate with offspring sex ratio or mortality. The social environment during reproduction therefore does not necessarily modify sex allocation and offspring physiology, even if it causes differences in maternal physiology. We propose that maternal effects of the social environment strongly depend upon the type of social stimuli and the timing of changes in the social environment and hormones with respect to the reproductive cycle and meiosis.  2018 Elsevier Inc."

The nutritional environment provided to a fetus is an important source of developmental plasticity. Reptiles are a particularly interesting system to study this plasticity because of their varied routes of maternal nutrient allocation to reproduction. Most reptiles provide their offspring with all or most of the nutrients they require in egg yolk (lecithotrophy) while viviparous reptiles also provide their offspring with nutrients via a placenta (placentotrophy). We review the ways in which both lecithotrophy and placentotrophy can lead to differences in the nutrients embryonic reptiles receive, and discuss how these differences lead to developmental plasticity in offspring phenotype. We finish by reviewing the ecological and conservation consequences of nutritional-driven developmental plasticity in reptiles. If nutritional-driven developmental plasticity has fitness consequences, then understanding the basis of this plasticity has exciting potential to identify how reptile recruitment is affected by environmental changes in food supply. Such knowledge is critical to our ability to protect taxa threatened by environmental change.  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

We found that prenatal predator stress (PPS) (1) increased juvenile anxiety-like behaviors and the appearance of antipredator behaviors, (2) did not affect the response of offspring to predatory stressors, and (3) did not influence the physiological response of juveniles to stressors (immobilization) nor the immunological responses to SRBC and PHA challenges. This work shows the influence of PPS on the development of behavioral responses in the offspring, whom displayed a state of anxiety and behavioral changes associated with decreased locomotor activity and avoidance behaviors. Thus, these individuals prenatally exposed to predatory cues show behavioral adaptations that may contribute to avoid predators in the adult life.  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

I determined (1) how the interaction between incubation temperature and egg size affects sex allocation of Chamaeleo calyptratus and (2) how incubation temperature and maternal parent (clutch) affect water uptake by eggs and body size, growth, and climbing speed of hatchlings and juveniles. Eggs from five clutches were exposed to five temperature treatments with clutches replicated within and among treatments. Temperature affected sex, but only when egg size was included as a factor in analyses. At intermediate (28C) temperatures, daughters were more likely to be produced from large eggs and sons more likely to be produced from small eggs, while at 25 and 30C, the pattern of sex allocation was reversed. Temperature and clutch affected water uptake and body size. Nonetheless, the direction of temperature and clutch effects on water uptake by eggs and on the size of hatchlings were not the same and the direction of temperature effects on body sizes of hatchlings and juveniles differed as well. Clutch affected hatchling size but not juvenile size and growth rate. Clutch, but not incubation temperature, affected climbing speed, but the fastest hatchlings were not from the same clutches as the fastest juveniles. The independent effects of incubation temperature and clutch indicate that hatchling phenotypes are influenced largely by conditions experienced during incubation, while juvenile phenotypes are influenced largely by conditions experienced in the rearing environment.  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Such preferences may reflect that the benefits of begging vary with the parent's sex given that females and males often differ in the amount of care they provide and/or in their responsiveness to begging levels. Alternatively, they may reflect the outcome of sexual conflict over care as females may deposit compounds into eggs tha talter offspring begging behaviour such that it increases male contributions towards care. For example, females might use male presence during egg laying as a cue for whether they might receive male assistance in care. Here, we studied offspring begging behaviour towards male and female parents in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides by manipulating male presence or absence during egg laying and providing larvae with a simultaneous choice between an unfamiliar female and male adult beetle. We then recorded begging behaviour of (1) nave newly hatched larvae that had no prior experience of a parent and (2) larvae after 24 h of care by foster parents. Larvae showed a clear preference for associating with and begging towards females both when nave and after 24 h of care. We found no evidence for prenatal maternal effects on larval begging behaviour. Our study reveals that offspring are predisposed to preferentially beg towards females independently of prior experiences with parents and highlights the importance of considering responses of begging offspring to parental attributes, such as the parent's sex, for our understanding of family conflicts.  2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour"

Maternal antibodies passed on to offspring provide primary protection to neonates against diverse pathogenic antigens, but they may also affect offspring growth and influence the development of an offspring's own immune response. The effects of maternal antibodies on offspring performance commonly require that the disease environment experienced by a mother prior to breeding matches the environment encountered by her offspring after hatching/birth. However, other circumstances, like postnatal rearing conditions that affect offspring food availability, may also determine the effects of maternal antibodies on offspring growth and immunity. To date, knowledge about how prenatal immune-mediated maternal effects interact with various postnatal rearing conditions to affect offspring development and phenotype in wild bird population remains elusive. Here we experimentally studied the interactive effects of pre-laying maternal immunization with a bacterial antigen (lipopolysaccharide) and post-hatching rearing conditions, altered by brood size manipulation, on offspring growth and humoral immunity of wild great tits (Parus major). Results: We found that maternal immunization and brood size manipulation interactively affected the growth and specific humoral immune response of avian offspring. Among nestlings reared in enlarged broods, only those that originated from immunized mothers grew better and were heavier at fledging stage compared to those that originated from non-immunized mothers. In contrast, no such effects were observed among nestlings reared in non-manipulated (control) broods. Moreover, offspring of immunized females had a stronger humoral immune response to lipopolysaccharide during postnatal development than offspring of non-immunized females, but only when the nestling was reared in control broods. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that offspring development and their ability to cope with pathogens after hatching are driven by mutual influences of pathogen-induced prenatal maternal effects and post-hatching rearing conditions. Our findings suggest that immune-mediated maternal effects may have context-dependent influences on offspring growth and immune function, related to the postnatal environmental conditions experienced by the progeny.  2018 The Author(s)."

Some birds can allocate resources unevenly among the eggs within a clutch, prioritizing those at the beginning of the laying sequence, in order to maximize reproductive success. The changes in egg color according to laying sequence may be an adaptation to pressure from predators or brood parasites. Methods: In this study, effects of laying sequence on egg color and embryonic heart rate in Russet Sparrows (Passer cinnamomeus) were investigated using artificial nest boxes. The eggs were divided into three groups: first to be laid, intermediate in the laying sequence, and last to be laid. We maintained the eggs in an incubator and measured embryonic heart rates. Results: Avian visual modeling showed that the background color brightness of the last eggs laid was significantly higher (whiter) than those of the other eggs. All eggs were about the same size and hatched around 13 days, indicating that laying sequence significantly affected embryonic development speed; the last eggs to be laid developed significantly faster than did the first in the clutch. Conclusions: Our study quantified the effect of laying sequence on egg color variation and proved that laying sequence has an important effect on embryonic heart rate in Russet Sparrows.  2018 The Author(s)."

Parental effects, a type of nongenetic inheritance, may play a key role in creating and maintaining this within-species diversity in aposematic signals; however, a comprehensive test of this notion is lacking. Using the ladybird Adalia bipunctata, we assessed how egg coloration and defence level (concentration of the toxic alkaloid (-)-adaline) is influenced both by simulated predation risk in the egg-laying environment and by parental phenotype (coloration and toxin level). We found that egg toxin level and colour were predicted by parental phenotype but were not altered in response to cues of egg predators. Egg luminance (lightness) was positively correlated with paternal elytral luminance, while maternal toxin level positively predicted egg toxin level. In response to egg predator cues, ladybird mothers altered the timing of laying and total egg number, but not egg toxin level or colour. It appears therefore that in A. bipunctata variation between individuals of the same morph in the colour and toxin level of the eggs they lay, that is, egg aposematic phenotype, is more strongly influenced by individual variation in parental aposematic traits than by environmental cues of egg predation risk. Furthermore, these results provide the first indication that, in a warningly coloured species, male coloration may play a dual role as predator deterrent and indicator of paternal quality, influencing maternal investment in offspring.  2018 The Authors"

Among species, such variation may accomplish different functions, the most obvious of which is camouflage and background matching. Within species, it has been proposed that inter-female variation in eggshell pigmentation patterns can reflect egg, maternal or paternal traits and hence may provide cues to conspecifics about egg, maternal or paternal phenotypic quality. However, the relationship between protoporphyrin-based eggshell pigmentation and egg or maternal/paternal traits appears to be highly variable among species. We investigated patterns of intraspecific variation in Eurasian barn swallow Hirundo r. rustica protoporphyrin-based eggshell pigmentation, and analysed its association with egg and clutch characteristics, maternal/paternal phenotypic traits and parental feeding effort. Eggshell pigmentation pattern significantly varied between breeding colonies, was significantly repeatable in first clutches laid by the same females in different years (intraclass correlation coefficient ranging between 0.56 and 0.63), but it was not significantly associated with egg traits, such as position in the laying sequence, egg mass, yolk testosterone concentration and antioxidant capacity. It was weakly or non-significantly associated with female and male traits (sexual ornaments), but females laying darker (higher pigment intensity) first clutches had higher hatching success, suggesting that eggshell pigment intensity may predict fitness. Male nestling feeding effort was not predicted by eggshell pigmentation. In addition, females with darker breast plumage colouration (a melanin-based trait related to fitness) laid highly protoporphyrin-covered eggs, suggesting the presence of a previously unappreciated link between protoporphyrin biosynthesis and plumage melanisation. Moreover, the proportion of male offspring increased in clutches originating from highly protoporphyrin-covered eggs, suggesting that parents could acquire visual cues about their future brood sex composition before egg hatching. Our results support the idea that intraspecific signalling via eggshell pigmentation is a species-specific rather than a general feature of avian taxa.  2018 The Authors"

The uncertainty that results from using demographic rates from just a few sites is especially pervasive in population projections, which are critical for a wide range of questions in ecology and conservation. We developed a simple simulation to quantify how this lack of geographic representativeness can affect inferences about the global mean and variance of growth rates, which has implications for the robust design of a wide range of population studies. Using a coastal songbird, saltmarsh sparrow Ammodramus caudacutus, as a case study, we first estimated survival, fecundity, and population growth rates at 21 sites distributed across much of their breeding range. We then subsampled this large, representative dataset according to five sampling scenarios in order to simulate a variety of geographic biases in study design. We found spatial variation in demographic rates, but no large systematic patterns. Estimating the global mean and variance of growth rates using subsets of the data suggested that at least 1015 sites were required for reasonably unbiased estimates, highlighting how relying on demographic data from just a few sites can lead to biased results when extrapolating across a species range. Sampling at the full 21 sites, however, offered diminishing returns, raising the possibility that for some species accepting some geographical bias in sampling can still allow for robust range-wide inferences. The subsampling approach presented here, while conceptually simple, could be used with both new and existing data to encourage efficiency in the design of long-term or large-scale ecological studies.  2017 The Authors"

Due to their widespread prevalence, these threats often co-occur, yet their interactive effects on organisms remain poorly understood. Some reptiles are vulnerable to these threats because they have specific microclimate requirements for embryonic development and because pollutants are maternally transferred to their eggs; both incubation temperature and pollutants affect reptile sex determination. In aquatic turtles, females often select nest sites in recently planted agricultural fields but the impact of nesting in polluted agricultural habitats is not understood. We examined the influences of crop agriculture and mercury pollution on nest microclimate and offspring sex ratios of Chelydra serpentina. We hypothesized that crop growth in agricultural fields would shade and cool turtle nests, decrease moisture levels, increase male offspring production, and interact with maternally-derived mercury to impact sex determination. As predicted, nests shaded by crops had lower average temperatures (2.5 C) and moisture levels (107 kPa) than control nests. In field and laboratory experiments, agricultural thermal regimens increased the proportion of male offspring in clutches and this effect was intensified in the presence of mercury. Global temperatures are expected to rise within the 21st century and to have a feminizing effect on reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination. That prediction should be refined to incorporate how the cooling effect of some local habitat conditions (e.g., agricultural fields), and interactions between anthropogenic land-use and common pollutants, will interact with climate change to influence sex ratios of reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination.  2018 Elsevier Ltd"

Oxidative stress, a physiological mediator of life-history trade-offs, may play a major role in this trade-off by constraining, or being costly to, growth and begging behaviour. Yet, despite implications for the evolution of life-history strategies and parentoffspring conflicts, the interplay between growth, begging behaviour and resistance to oxidative stress remains to be investigated. We experimentally challenged wild great tit (Parus major) offspring by infesting nests with a common ectoparasite, the hen flea (Ceratophyllus gallinae), and simultaneously tested for compensating effects of increased vitamin E availability, a common dietary antioxidant. We further quantified the experimental treatment effects on offspring growth, begging intensity and oxidative stress. Flea-infested nestlings of both sexes showed reduced body mass during the first half of the nestling phase, but this effect vanished short before fledging. Begging intensity and oxidative stress of both sexes were unaffected by both experimental treatments. Feeding rates were not affected by the experimental treatments, but parents of flea-infested nests fed nestlings with a higher proportion of caterpillars, the main source of antioxidants. Additionally, female nestlings begged significantly less than males in control nests, whereas both sexes begged at similar rates in vitamin E-supplemented nests. Our study shows that a parasite exposure does not necessarily affect oxidative stress levels or begging intensity, but suggests that parents can compensate for negative effects of parasitism by modifying food composition. Furthermore, our results indicate that the begging capacity of the less competitive sex is constrained by antioxidant availability.  2018 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

Several functional explanations predict positive covariation between eggshell pigmentation and phenotypic quality of nestlings. We test this prediction in spotless starlings Sturnus unicolor by using biometric measurements and telomere length of hatchlings and fledglings as proxies of phenotypic quality. Female spotless starlings lay immaculate blue-green eggs, a sexually selected signal directed to males. Pigmentation predicts positive associations with concentration of antioxidants and testosterone in the yolk and with paternal provisioning effort during nestling growth. Eggshell pigmentation (blue-green chroma) is not associated with telomere length of hatchlings, which suggests weak maternal effects on this trait. However, we find negative associations of eggshell colouration with both body condition and telomere length of fledglings. Moreover, we find positive associations between eggshell colouration and clutch size, which suggests that sibling competition is higher in nests with more coloured eggshells. Previous works demonstrated that level of sibling competition is positively related to telomere erosion and, thus, the detected negative associations between eggshell colouration, body condition and telomere length of fledglings would reflect higher level of competition in nests with more coloured eggshells. We therefore speculate with the possibility that females that lay larger clutches also lay more coloured eggshells that elicit increased paternal provisioning effort and, thus, raise larger broods at the expense of telomere erosion of their offspring.  2018 The Authors"

The study of tolerance can be particularly illuminating in the comprehension of avian brood parasite host interactions because if hosts can tolerate parasitism this may resolve the long-lasting paradox of why some hosts do not reject parasite eggs despite costly parasitism. Surprisingly, although the study of host defenses against brood parasites is a hot spot for research in behavioral ecology, empirical studies of tolerance are very rare. Here, I first identify the main reasons explaining reluctance to incorporate tolerance in the study of avian brood parasite host interactions. Tolerance defenses have been neglected because: 1) behavioral ecologists have primarily targeted on antagonistic coevolution which is most likely selected by resistance; 2) because tolerance (contrary to resistance) cannot be easily measured on host individuals; and 3) because there is a limited knowledge about the mechanisms of tolerance. In a second step, I review current evidence about tolerance in hosts and propose yet unexplored mechanisms to be studied based on parental investment theory. Finally, I propose an experimental framework based on well-established knowledge about phenotypic plasticity that can help detecting the effects of tolerance in future studies. I urge behavioral ecologists to embark on suggested mechanistic approaches to study tolerance defenses to achieve a better comprehension of avian brood parasite host coevolution.

Examples of food provisioning and key nutrients enhancing immune function were seen across the three study type distinctions, as were cases of trace metals and pharmaceuticals impairing the immunity of wildlife species. More generally, food provisioning in field studies tended to increase innate and adaptive responses to certain immune challenges, whereas patterns were less clear in captive studies. Mild food restriction often enhanced, whereas severe food restriction frequently impaired immunity. However, to enable stronger conclusions we stress a need for further research, especially field studies, and highlight the importance of integrating nutritional manipulation, immune challenge, and functional outcomes.

The functional interaction between egg components, such as antioxidants and hormones, suggests that a change in the concentration of one component will have effects on offspring traits that depend on the concentration of other interacting components. However, the combined effects of variation in different egg components are virtually unknown. Bird eggs contain vitamin E, a major antioxidant, and also maternal corticosterone. The independent consequences of variation in the egg concentrations of these compounds for offspring phenotype are largely unknown and no study has investigated their combined effects. We manipulated the concentration of vitamin E and corticosterone in the eggs of the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) by administering a physiological (2 s.d.) dose both independently and in combination. We tested for an effect on chick post-natal growth, plasma antioxidant capacity (TAC) and oxidative compounds (TOS). Separate administration of vitamin E or corticosterone caused a reduction in body mass relative to controls, whereas the combined administration of the two compounds reversed their negative effects. These results suggest that maternal egg components, such as antioxidants and steroid hormones, interact and mothers must balance their concentrations in order to achieve optimal offspring phenotype. The functional relationship between vitamin E and corticosterone is corroborated by the observation of positive covariation between these compounds.  2018.

Other hormones, such as thyroid hormones (THs; thyroxine and triiodothyronine), have been largely ignored in ecological research until recently. We summarize the recent findings, identify knowledge gaps, and provide future research directions investigating the role of TH-mediated maternal effects in ecological context across taxa. Surprisingly, data on the sources of naturally occurring variation in maternal THs and their fitness effects are lacking in most vertebrate taxa. There is considerable variation in maternal TH levels in eggs across taxa. Avian egg THs show heritable variation, and data from fish and amphibians suggest female consistency in egg TH levels. In birds, variation in maternal THs was associated with important ecological factors, such as food availability and temperature. THs also showed intra-individual variation varying systematically within clutches. Importantly, exposure to maternal THs within naturally occurring range affected offspring fitnessrelated traits (growth and survival) in birds and fish. These findings make THs an interesting mechanism underlying maternal effects, which likely shape offspring phenotypes.  2018 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved."

We review longitudinal studies of wild bird populations that test the relationship between annual reproductive success and lifespan and find the majority to report a positive correlation, while none reports a negative correlation. Heterogeneity in individual quality in resource acquisition, masking resource-based tradeoffs, therefore appears to be common in birds. Considering that there is little evidence for heritable variation in fitness, heterogeneity in individual quality among adults may be due to life-long effects of developmental conditions. In a 20-year case study on common terns Sterna hirundo, we test for life-long effects of cohort quality and within-cohort nest quality, but find no significant effects on long-term proxies of quality. Since other studies do find strong life-long effects of developmental conditions, we suggest that the brood reduction strategy adopted by common terns, causing the majority of offspring to die rapidly after hatching, efficiently reduces variation in offspring quality at independence. As such, a brood reduction strategy may contribute to reduced heterogeneity in adult survival in stochastic environments, both suggested to be more common and adaptive in long-lived species. Further study is required to assess heterogeneity in individual reproduction, especially in relation to environmental stochasticity and species life-history strategies, in order to assess whether the relative strength of selection in early and late life may indeed affect the magnitude of heterogeneity in individual quality over life, and how this is mediated by parentoffspring conflict.  2017 The Authors"

Most infectious agents enter the body via mucosal surfaces, thus SIgA serves in the defense against respiratory, intestinal, and urinogenitary infections, as well as periodontal disease and caries. This study examined the possibility that pre- and postnatal exposure to cigarette and cannabis is associated with individual differences in Secretory Immunoglobulin A (SIgA) levels in early childhood. Methods: Participants were 50 mother/infant (29 boys; 35% Caucasian) dyads recruited at their first prenatal appointment in a large northeastern community hospital in the United States. Repeated assessments of pre- and postnatal cigarette and cannabis were conducted beginning in the first trimester of pregnancy, using multiple methods (i.e., saliva, meconium, self-report). Infants were grouped into those prenatally exposed to either cigarette only (n = 19), cigarette and cannabis (n = 19), or with no prenatal substance exposure (n = 12). At age 5 years, the children's saliva was collected and assayed for SIgA. Results: There were group differences in SIgA levels as a function of prenatal exposure to cigarette and cannabis  children in the cigarette only and the cigarette and cannabis groups had higher SIgA levels compared to the non-exposed children. Children who experienced the combination of postnatal exposure to cigarette and cannabis had higher levels of SIgA, even after accounting for prenatal exposures and other covariates relevant to immune system functioning. Conclusions: Prenatal and postnatal exposure to cigarette and cannabis may be associated with hyperactivity of mucosal immunity in early childhood. Links between cigarette and cannabis exposure and health problems in early childhood may be partially explained by prenatal and postnatal exposure-related changes in mucosal immunity.  2018"

This study was designed to quantify the steroid concentrations in the eggshells of Japanese quail. We hypothesized that the steroids would be accumulated in the eggshells in a sex-dependent manner. Eggshells were obtained from three different stages (after laying, 15 days of incubation, and after hatching). The internal contents of the shells were carefully removed, completely dried and pulverized. The steroid contents of the eggshells were then measured by RIA. Physiologic variations in steroids were analyzed according to the amounts accumulated in the eggshells with the different embryonic stages. Results indicate that eggshell testosterone concentrations were high after laying. However, the concentrations were decreased during embryonic development and hatching and no difference was found in eggshell testosterone levels between male and female. However, eggshell estradiol concentrations were undetectable at laying time and the amounts were significantly increased at 15 days of incubation and slightly after hatching. Eggshell estradiol levels were significantly high in female eggshells than male during embryonic development. In contrast, eggshell corticosterone levels were significantly higher in males than in females after hatching. These results clearly demonstrated that eggshells accumulated steroid hormones, and the amounts varied during embryonic development concomitant with changes the internal contents of the eggs.  2017 Elsevier Inc."

However, it is often assumed that the sole adaptive value of this allocation is to increase offspring fitness. Because carotenoids can be pro-oxidants or antioxidants depending on their concentrations and their chemical environment (i.e. presence of other antioxidants), dams may need to dispose of excess carotenoids upon depletion of other antioxidants to prevent oxidative damage. Additionally, the amount of carotenoids deposited in eggs may be dependent on male traits such as quality and coloration. We evaluated these two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses for carotenoid allocation to eggs and assessed paternal effects by supplementing male and female brown anole lizards, Anolis sagrei, with dietary carotenoids or with a combination of carotenoids and vitamin C. We found significant differences in the antioxidant capacities of fertilized and unfertilized eggs produced by female lizards, but the treatment did not affect the antioxidant capacity or carotenoid content of eggs. However, the carotenoid concentration of unfertilized eggs from carotenoid-supplemented females was significantly higher than eggs from the control group. Male coloration and body size did not affect the antioxidant capacity or carotenoid content of the eggs. Carotenoids may be allocated to unfertilized eggs to offset oxidative damage to the dam, with a neutral effect on offspring, rather than to solely provide antioxidant benefits to offspring as has been widely assumed.  2018 Elsevier Inc."

To investigate whether incubation temperature influences avian behaviors, we collected wood duck (Aix sponsa) eggs from the field and incubated them at three naturally occurring incubation temperatures (35.0, 35.8, and 37.0C). We conducted multiple repeated behavioral trials on individual ducklings between 5 and 15 days post-hatch to assess activity, exploratory, and boldness behaviors, classified along a proactive-reactive continuum. We measured growth rates and circulating levels of baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels to investigate possible physiological correlates of behavior. Ducklings incubated at the lowest temperature displayed more proactive behaviors than those incubated at the two higher temperatures. We also found that younger ducklings exhibited more proactive behavior than older ducklings and males exhibited more proactive behavior than females. Further, duckling behaviors were repeatable across time and contexts, indicative of a proactivereactive continuum of behavioral tendencies. However, neither corticosterone levels nor growth rates were related to behavior. This provides some of the first evidence that incubation temperature, a critical parental effect, influences avian offspring behaviors that may be important for survival. Our results identify incubation temperature as a mechanism that contributes to the development of behavioral traits and, in part, explains how multiple behavioral types may be maintained within populations.  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

To this aim, prior to laying we exposed mothers to either mink decoys or nonpredator rabbit decoys and explored the antipredator behavior of 118 chicks at the age of 2 days. We found that chicks from second-laid eggs by predator-exposed mothers crouched faster after hearing a playback with adult alarm calls than chicks from second-laid eggs by control mothers. Besides, chicks from third-laid eggs by predator-exposed mothers were lighter than control chicks, but this was not due to differences in egg volume.

In the barn swallow Hirundo rustica, as in many other passerines, females should increase the proportion of sons in their broods with increasing maternal body size, because rearing sons is particularly costly to small females with low feeding capacity, and because reproductive success in the barn swallow, which may depend on rearing conditions, varies more in males. However, evidence supporting this prediction is lacking, even in this model species of sex allocation. Using the Asian subspecies of the barn swallow H. r. gutturalis, we confirmed this prediction. Larger mothers with a longer keel had more sons in their brood. We found that male nestlings invested more in pheomelanin pigmentation compared with female nestlings, while they had shorter wing lengths, indicating that male nestlings are costly to rear compared with female nestlings. Smaller mothers that are at a disadvantage in provisioning may not retard the nestling period by producing daughters, which reduces their parental investment and thus saves their residual reproductive value.

For example, numerous avian studies show that aggressive competition with conspecifics tends to result in females allocating more testosterone to their egg yolks, and this may cause offspring to have more competitive phenotypes. However, deviations from this pattern of maternal testosterone allocation are found, largely in studies of colonial species, and have yet to be explained. Colonial species may have different life-history constraints causing different yolk testosterone allocation strategies in response to conspecific competition, but few studies have experimentally tested whether colonial species do indeed differ from that of solitary species. To test this, we collected eggs from zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata, a colonial species, in the presence and absence of conspecific intrusions. Females did not alter the concentration of testosterone deposited in eggs laid during intrusions despite becoming more aggressive. These results suggest that maternal effects are not characterized by a uniform response to the social environment, but rather need to be contextualized with life-history traits.  2018 The Authors"

The objectives of this study were to investigate the isotopic relationships between maternal reproductive (i.e., yolk, yolk-sac placenta) and somatic tissues (i.e., muscle and liver) relative to embryos in the Bonnethead Shark Sphyrna tiburo, to evaluate the fractionation of stable carbon (13C) and nitrogen (15N) isotopes between these tissues. Additionally, we examined intra-uterine variability in the isotopic relationships to ascertain whether this species may exhibit variable nutrient allocation. Embryos showed similar magnitudes of enrichment in 13C (i.e., 13C, difference between adult and embryo) relative to adult tissues (13C = ~1.0). However, embryos were depleted in 15N relative to adult muscle tissues (15N = 1.0), a finding that contrasts 15N values reported for other placentotrophic sharks. Embryo-muscle 15N was correlated with length, supporting the contention that the magnitude of enrichment between embryonic and maternal tissues results from the shift from yolk to placental feeding. Embryo 15N and 15N values showed significant intra-uterine variability; a result not observed for 13C and 13C values. The contrasting patterns in fractionation among placentotrophic sharks highlight the importance of evaluating these relationships across elasmobranch taxa with consideration for different tissues, reproductive strategies and stages of gestation. The divergent findings support future evaluation of stable isotope relationships between mothers and offspring for purposes of estimating inherent isotopic variability and how this variability may inform physiological and dietary mechanisms.  2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature."

Perhaps one of the most essential drivers of coping behaviour of adults is the environment experienced during their early-life development. Although the study of coping, defined as behaviours displayed in response to environmental challenges, has a long and rich research history in biology, recent literature has repeatedly pointed out that the processes through which coping behaviours develop in individuals are still largely unknown. In this review, we make a move towards integrating ultimate and proximate lines of coping behaviour research. After broadly defining coping behaviours (1), we review why, from an evolutionary perspective, the development of coping has become tightly linked to the early-life environment (2), which relevant developmental processes are most important in creating coping behaviours adjusted to the early-life environment (3), which influences have been shown to impact those developmental processes (4) and what the adaptive significance of intergenerational transmission of coping behaviours is, in the context of behavioural adaptations to a fast changing world (5). Important concepts such as effects of parents, habitat, nutrition, social group and stress are discussed using examples from empirical studies on mammals, fish, birds and other animals. In the discussion, we address important problems that arise when studying the development of coping behaviours and suggest solutions.  The Author(s) 2018."

The present study provides the first genome-wide screening for differentially expressed genes that are linked to morphological alterations of gonadal tissue from chicken embryos after exposure to TBT. We applied a single injection of TBT (between 0.5 and 30 pg as Sn/g egg) into incubated fertile eggs to simulate maternal transfer of the endocrine disruptive compound. Methyltestosterone (MT) served as a positive control (30 pg/g egg). After 19 days of incubation, structural features of the gonads as well as genome-wide gene expression profiles were assessed simultaneously. TBT induced significant morphological and histological malformations of gonadal tissue from female embryos that show a virilization of the ovaries. This phenotypical virilization was mirrored by altered expression profiles of sex-dependent genes. Among these are several transcription and growth factors (e.g. FGF12, CTCF, NFIB), whose altered expression might serve as a set of markers for early identification of endocrine active chemicals that affect embryonic development by transcriptome profiling without the need of elaborate histological analyses.  2017 The Author(s)"

Identifying traits of species associated with increases or decreases in infection outcomes with resource provisioning could improve assessments of wildlife most prone to disease risks in changing environments. We conducted a phylogenetic meta-analysis of 342 hostparasite interactions across 56 wildlife species and three broad taxonomic groups of parasites to identify host-level traits that influence whether provisioning is associated with increases or decreases in infection. We predicted dietary generalists that capitalize on novel food would show greater infection in provisioned habitats owing to population growth and food-borne exposure to contaminants and parasite infectious stages. Similarly, species with fast life histories could experience stronger demographic and immunological benefits from provisioning that affect parasite transmission. We also predicted that wide-ranging and migratory behaviours could increase infection risks with provisioning if concentrated and non-seasonal foods promote dense aggregations that increase exposure to parasites. We found that provisioning increased infection with bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa (i.e. microparasites) most for wide-ranging, dietary generalist host species. Effect sizes for ectoparasites were also highest for host species with large home ranges but were instead lowest for dietary generalists. In contrast, the type of provisioning was a stronger correlate of infection outcomes for helminths than host species traits. Our analysis highlights host traits related to movement and feeding behaviour as important determinants of whether species experience greater infection with supplemental feeding. These results could help prioritize monitoring wildlife with particular trait profiles in anthropogenic habitats to reduce infectious disease risks in provisioned populations.  2017 The Authors.

To predict the impact of parentoffspring conflict, we model the evolution of maternal effects on local adaptation of young. We find that parentoffspring conflict strongly influences the stability of maternal effects; moreover, the nature of the disagreement between parents and young predicts how conflict is resolved: when mothers favor less extreme mixtures of phenotypes relative to offspring (i.e., when mothers stand to gain by hedging their bets), mothers win the conflict by providing offspring with limited amounts of information. When offspring favor overproduction of one and the same phenotype across all environments compared to mothers (e.g., when offspring favor a larger body size), neither side wins the conflict and signaling breaks down. Only when offspring favor less extreme mixtures relative to their mothers (something no current model predicts), offspring win the conflict and obtain full information about the environment. We conclude that a partial or complete breakdown of informative maternal effects will be the norm rather than the exception in the presence of parentoffspring conflict.  2017 The Author(s).

Maternal hormones, such as androgens (testosterone, T and androstenedione, A4), transferred to embryos and egg yolks may simultaneously organize multiple behavioural and physiological traits. Although previous studies demonstrated an association between the mother's personality and yolk androgen levels, the independent effects of the male partner's personality and pair combination remains unknown. We test this association using an ecological model species for personality research, the great tit (Parus major) using multiple approaches: (1) a wild population, (2) a randomly mated captive population and (3) an experimental study with (dis)assortatively mated pairs from lines selected for fast exploration/boldness or slow exploration/shyness. Egg androgen concentrations were associated with variation in female personality traits, and the experimental data suggested that this is independent of male personality: Experimental females from the slow-shy line tended to have higher egg T concentrations than females from the fast-bold line, with no effect of male personality. Shy females from the wild population had higher egg A4 concentration than bold females. However, in the correlative data yolk hormones were linked with male personality, as well as the interaction between female and male traits: Male handling responsiveness correlated negatively with egg A4 concentration in wild birds. In randomly mated birds, pairs that were mated assortatively for personality had lower egg T concentrations than disassortatively mated pairs. Given that egg androgens are known mediators of avian personality, our results suggest that maternal hormones might contribute to the heritability of personality, may be sensitive to the social context of mating, and act as key drivers of individual differences.

Yet, unveiling such carry-over effects is essential to understand the evolution of parental life-history strategies. In altricial birds, the number of brood mates can affect competition regime and other nest ecological conditions, whose effects may be at least partly expressed in adulthood. We either increased or decreased the size of barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) broods and analyzed the consequences of brood size manipulation on morphological feather traits, breeding performance, and lifespan of the offspring when adult. Upon recruitment (age 1year), individuals from enlarged broods had shorter wings, later reproduction, and lower breeding output than those from reduced broods. The negative effect of brood enlargement on wing length persisted at age 2years. Recruits from enlarged broods had longer lifespan but the proportion of nestlings that were recruited tended to be smaller for enlarged compared to reduced broods. Hence, large brood size had negative phenotypic effects in adulthood. Our results also suggest that stronger viability selection on offspring from enlarged broods results in differential survival of highly viable offspring that express longer life expectancy when adult and/or that smaller reproductive effort of 1-year-old offspring from enlarged broods boosts their life expectancy, potentially compensating for reduced annual fecundity. Number of brood mates can thus have carry-over effects on fitness components, including lifespan, which should be incorporated in the analysis of complex reproductive trade-offs. Significance statement: Ecological conditions in early life can affect survival and physical conditions but the extent to which these effects extend into adulthood is largely unknown. In this experiment, we altered the size of barn swallow broods and monitored the consequences of the change in competition regime in the brood of rearing in adulthood. When adult, individuals that had been reared in an enlarged brood had shorter wings and decreased breeding success. However, individuals from enlarged broods lived longer, possibly because only high-quality individuals from such broods survived through the first year of life. Thus, rearing conditions have important long-term effects, implying that parents have to optimize the number of offspring they decide to produce.  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

In reptiles, early thermal environments (nest temperatures) can impact offspring phenotype and survival in important ways, yet we still lack an understanding of whether general trends exist and the magnitude of impact. Understanding these patterns is important in predicting how climate change will affect reptile populations and the role of phenotypic plasticity in buffering populations. We compiled data from 175 reptile studies to examine, and quantify, the effect of incubation temperature on phenotype and survival. Using meta-analytic approaches (standardized mean difference between incubation treatments, Hedges' g), we show that across all trait types examined there is, on average, a moderate to large magnitude of effect of incubation temperatures (absolute effect: |g| = 0.75). Unsurprisingly, this influence was extremely large for incubation duration, as predicted, with warmer temperatures decreasing incubation time overall (g = 8.42). Other trait types, including behaviour, physiology, morphology, performance, and survival experienced reduced, but still mostly moderate to large effects, with particularly strong effects on survival. Moreover, the impact of incubation temperature persisted at least one-year post-hatching, suggesting that these effects have the potential to impact fitness in the long term. The magnitude of effect increased as the change in temperature increased (e.g. 6C versus 2C) in almost all cases, and tended to decrease when temperatures of the treatments fluctuated around a mean temperature compared to when they were constant. The effect also depended on the mid-temperature of the comparison, but not in consistent ways, with some traits experiencing the greatest effects at extreme temperatures, while others did not. The highly heterogeneous nature of the effects we observe, along with a large amount of unexplained variability, indicates that the shape of reaction norms between phenotype and temperature, along with ecological and/or experimental factors, are important when considering general patterns. Our analyses provide new insights into the effects of incubation environments on reptile phenotype and survival and allow general, albeit coarse, predictions for taxa experiencing warming nest temperatures under climatic change.  2017 Cambridge Philosophical Society"

One nearly universal type of disturbance is the handling of study animals as a component of trial setup. Even low to moderate levels of handling can be a substantial stressor to study animals, which may negatively affect their offspring via maternal effects. Understanding how routine human handling and manipulation may affect the outcome of research studies is therefore critical for interpreting study outcomes. We tested whether repeatedly handling and manipulating (i.e., manually disengaging) amplexed pairs of wood frogs (Rana sylvatica [Lithobates sylvaticus]), which have an explosive breeding season, would affect their reproductive output and offspring fitness. Handling and manipulation did not alter any parameter that we measured: reproductive timing, hatching success, and offspring larval duration, survival, and size at metamorphosis. These results suggest that handling and manipulation by researchers may have a negligible effect on wood frog reproduction and offspring fitness. It is possible that many species that are commonly used in reproductive studies because they suppress behavioral and physiological responses during the mating season are likewise unaffected by human handling. Nevertheless, researchers should examine possible consequences of methodological interventions on their study species in order to determine any potential influence on their results. Having a broad understanding of these effects on species that have robust or dampened stress responsiveness during the breeding season would be useful for making generalizations about potential effects.  2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

In birds, little is known about the influence of the quality of food consumed at the beginning of the reproductive period and its short-term effects on reproductive performance. To assess the role of diet in the physiological condition of female blue-footed booby, Sula nebouxii (BFBO), during reproduction we evaluated whether individual differences in diet (assessed by using 13C and 15N values of whole blood from female birds and muscle tissue of the principal prey species) prior to egg laying and during incubation influenced their lipid metabolic profile (measured as triglyceride levels and C:N ratio) and their reproductive performance (defined by laying date, clutch size and hatching success). Females with higher 15N values in their blood during the courtship and incubation periods had a higher lipid metabolic profile, earlier laying date, greater clutch size (23 eggs) and higher hatching success. Females that laid earlier and more eggs (23 eggs) consumed more Pacific anchoveta (Cetengraulis mysticetus) and Pacific thread herring (Opisthonema libertate) than did other females. These two prey species also had high amounts of lipids (C:N ratio) and caloric content (Kcal/g fresh weight). The quality of food consumed by females at the beginning of reproduction affected their physiological condition, as well as their short-term reproductive performance. Our work emphasizes the importance of determining the influence of food quality during reproduction to understand the reproductive decisions and consequences in long-lived animals.  2018 Gonzlez-Medina et al.

Many studies have supported the hypothesis that length polymorphism in some phenological genes is associated with differences in the photoperiodic responses among individuals and populations. However, evidence is inconsistent across species, genes and phenological traits. Among birds, there is a dearth of knowledge concerning the gene-phenotype association in non-migratory species. To contribute filling this gap, here we analyzed clutch initiation date of females of a species resident at temperate latitudes, the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis), in relation to the length polymorphism at four loci previously associated with breeding and migration phenology in other species: Adcyap1 and Npas2 genes, as well as two regions of the Clock gene. Although polymorphism was observed at three loci, allele size of the candidate genes seems not to predict the timing of breeding in females. In addition, similar genotype frequencies of all the analyzed genes were observed in early compared to late breeding females. Our results therefore suggest that the associations between photoperiodic candidate genes and breeding phenotype are not general across species and might represent adaptations of individual populations to the local environment.  2017 The Zoological Society of London"

The physiological effects of GCs critically depend on the time of exposure (short vs. long) as well as on their circulating levels (baseline vs. stress-induced). Previous experiments, in which chronic and high elevation of GC levels was induced, indicate that GCs impair both the activity of the immune system and the oxidative balance. Nonetheless, our knowledge on how mildly elevated GC levels, a situation much more common in nature, might influence homeostasis is limited. Therefore, we studied whether an increase in GC level within the baseline range suppresses or enhances condition (body mass, hematocrit and coccidian infestation) and physiological state (humoral innate immune system activity and oxidative balance). We implanted captive house sparrows Passer domesticus with either 60 days release corticosterone (CORT) or control pellets. CORT-treated birds had elevated baseline CORT levels one week after the implantation, but following this CORT returned to its pre-treatment level and the experimental groups had similar CORT levels one and two months following the implantation. The mass of tail feathers grown during the initial phase of treatment was smaller in treated than in control birds. CORT implantation had a transient negative effect on body mass and hematocrit, but both of these traits resumed the pre-treatment values by one month post-treatment. CORT treatment lowered oxidative damage to lipids (malondialdehyde) and enhanced constitutive innate immunity at one week and one month post-implantation. Our findings suggest that a relatively short-term (i.e. few days) elevation of baseline CORT might have a positive and stimulatory effect on animal physiology.  2018 Vgsi et al.

Here, we investigated whether neuroendocrine mechanisms controlling ovulatory processes are associated with the regulation of yolk T deposition. Circulatory profiles of luteinizing hormone (LH), T and estradiol levels were analysed during the last 7 h before ovulation in Japanese quail selected for contrasting yolk T concentrations. Moreover, the pituitary responsiveness to a single challenge with gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) was evaluated. High egg T (HET) birds displayed higher concentrations of LH at 3.5 h before ovulation than low egg T (LET) birds while no differences were found around the time of expected ovulation. The pre-ovulatory profile of T and estradiol levels did not differ between LET and HET females but pre-ovulatory plasma T positively correlated with LH concentrations at 6.5 h and 3.5 h before ovulation. The LH response to GnRH did not differ between LET and HET females. Our results demonstrate that the pre-ovulatory LH surge can determine the amount of T transferred into the egg yolk.

Corticosterone affects the development of brain asymmetry, suggesting that variation in yolk corticosterone concentration may also influence post-natal behavioral lateralization, a hypothesis that has never been tested so far. In the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis), we increased yolk corticosterone concentration within physiological limits and analyzed the direction of lateralization of hatchlings in reverting from supine to prone position (RTP response) and in pecking at dummy parental bills to solicit food provisioning (begging response). We found that corticosterone treatment negatively affected the frequency of begging and it may cause a slight leftward lateralization. However, the direction of lateralization of the RTP response was not affected by corticosterone administration. Thus, our study shows a maternal effect mediated by corticosterone on a behavioral trait involved in parent-offspring communication during food provisioning events.

Some of these substances even affect the transfer of these compounds in the next generation, but it is less clear how different maternally transmitted compounds interact with each other to shape reproductive resource allocation in their offspring. Here, we found that female Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica) that were exposed to high carotenoid levels during embryonic development transferred lower concentrations of yolk antioxidants to their own eggs later in life. This effect disappeared when both testosterone and carotenoid concentrations were manipulated simultaneously, showing long-term and interactive effects of these maternally derived egg components on a females own egg composition. Given that exposure to high levels of testosterone during embryo development stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impairs antioxidant defenses, we propose that carotenoids act as in ovo antioxidants in an oxidatively stressful environment (i.e. when levels of testosterone are high) but might have prooxidant properties in an environment where they are not used to counteract an increased production of ROS. In line with this hypothesis, we previously showed that prenatal exposure to increased concentrations of yolk carotenoids leads to a rise of oxidative damage at adulthood, but only when yolk testosterone concentrations were not experimentally increased as well. As a consequence, antioxidants in the body may be used to limit oxidative damage in females exposed to high levels of carotenoids during development (but not in females exposed to increased levels of both carotenoids and testosterone), resulting in lower amounts of antioxidants being available for deposition into eggs. Since prenatal antioxidant exposure is known to influence fitness-related traits, the effect detected in this study might have transgenerational consequences.  2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Probability of embryo survival in the late embryonic phase increased with increasing eggweight in control eggs, but not in AVIDIN+ eggs.

Plasma complement activity in 6-day-old AVIDIN+ chicks decreased with increasing body mass and tarsus length, the opposite was observed in control chicks, implying that the later post-hatching innate immune function of larger chicks was compromised by an increase in egg white avidin concentration.

We exposed C. picta eggs to biologically relevant amounts of the stress avoidance hormone, corticosterone, as a proxy for maternal stressors. We allowed the eggs to incubate in the field, then measured offspring phenotypes, conducted performance trials, and simulated nest emergence in a field experiment. Exogenous corticosterone reduced survivorship to hatch, but did not affect incubation duration, offspring size, overwinter survival, or size after hibernation. In performance trials, this hormone treatment reduced the frequency of righting, yet enhanced the righting speed of neonates. Regardless, these performance differences did not detectably alter survivorship in the nest emergence experiment.

Faster development of late-laid eggs can help reduce developmental differences and synchronize hatching, which is important for precocial species whose young must leave the nest soon after hatching. In this study, we examined the effect of egg laying sequence on length of the incubation period in Wood Ducks (Aix sponsa). Because incubation temperature strongly influences embryonic development rates, we tested the interactive effects of laying sequence and incubation temperature on the ability of late-laid eggs to accelerate development and synchronize hatching. We also examined the potential cost of faster development on duckling body condition. Fresh eggs were collected and incubated at three biologically relevant temperatures (Low: 34.9C, Medium: 35.8C, and High: 37.6C), and egg laying sequences from 1 to 12 were used. Length of the incubation period declined linearly as laying sequence advanced, but the relationship was strongest at medium temperatures followed by low temperatures and high temperatures. There was little support for including fresh egg mass in models of incubation period. Estimated differences in length of the incubation period between eggs 1 and 12 were 2.7 d, 1.2 d, and 0.7 d at medium, low and high temperatures, respectively. Only at intermediate incubation temperatures did development rates of late-laid eggs increase sufficiently to completely compensate for natural levels of developmental asynchrony that have been reported in Wood Duck clutches at the start of full incubation. Body condition of ducklings was strongly affected by fresh egg mass and incubation temperature but declined only slightly as laying sequence progressed. Our findings show that laying sequence and incubation temperature play important roles in helping to shape embryo development and hatching synchrony in a precocial bird.  2018 Hepp, Kennamer.

However, relatively little is known about how incubation temperature affects sex ratio and offspring condition in other animals. Incubating birds allocate varying time for egg incubation depending on the parents condition and ambient temperature, likely altering nest microclimate. To understand how incubation temperature impacts offspring phenotype in birds, we artificially incubated Zebra Finch (Taeniopygia guttata (Vieillot, 1817)) eggs at 36.2, 37.4, or 38.4 C during the entire incubation period and examined sex ratio and offspring quality. We found that incubation temperature of 36.2 C resulted in a greater likelihood of a young being male compared with 37.4 C, indicating that it is more likely for males to survive until the juvenile stage compared with females in the 36.2 C group. We also found sex-specific effects of incubation temperature on body composition. Although incubation temperature did not affect fat or lean mass of female young, male offspring from the 38.4 C group had significantly less lean mass throughout their lives compared with males from 37.4 or 36.2 C. This study shows that there are sex differences in the effects of incubation temperature, and variable incubation temperature has a capacity to influence offspring secondary sex ratio and body condition in songbirds.  2018, Canadian Science Publishing.

Indeed, prenatal environments can influence many behavioral strategies adopted by animals in postnatal life. There has been a great debate over the adaptive significance of this phenomenon of developmental programming; whether this represents a maternal strategy to maximize offspring survival under matching later conditions, or the effects merely reflect constraints placed on physiological systems. In this review, we will highlight the importance of prenatal conditions in shaping behavior in later life history stages, with a particular focus on the role of acoustic stimuli and the role of endocrine systems (the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal [HPA] axis) in mediating sustained programmed effects. While there is a great body of literature investigating several developmental factors that can cause long-term phenotypic effects, much less attention has been paid to the effects of sounds experienced during this developmental stage. However, there is a growing interest in this area, particularly in oviparous organisms. While we take a comparative approach here, much of the evidence will focus on avian species, due to the literature available for this taxa and the utility of external embryonic development when studying the embryonic responses to external stimuli. We will also highlight the important role that acoustic stimuli during development can have on later behaviors, and show the potential links between sound detection and activation of the HPA axis. Finally, we propose a novel hypothesis that the acoustic environment during prenatal development may program the HPA axis in such a way as to create phenotypes that cope better in certain environments in later life, and that acoustic signals could be a way of altering trajectories already put in place by maternal effects acting on the egg.  2018 Elsevier Inc."

Juvenile salmonids exhibit clear dominance hierarchies in early life. As one of the drivers for the adoption of alternative life histories in salmonids is the relative rate of resource acquisition, there is potential for juvenile behaviour to influence the subsequent life history strategy of the individual. Lacustrine brown trout, Salmo trutta, exhibit a multitude of life histories which includes among others the piscivorous (ferox) life history where individuals grow to large size and have delayed maturity and benthivorous and pelagic life histories where individuals grow to much smaller sizes, however mature earlier. Using a number of observable characteristics of dominance, this study compared differences in behaviour between size-matched pairs of progeny, reared under common garden conditions which are derived from alternative, co-existing life history strategy parents. We found that first-generation progeny of ferox trout were more aggressive, acquired more food, had lighter skin pigmentation and held more desirable positions than the progeny of benthivorous brown trout in an experimental stream system. Ferox trout progeny were dominant over benthivorous brown trout progeny in 90% of trials in dyadic contests. Given such clear differences in dominance, this study indicates that parentally acquired dominance-related differences, passed through either, or both, of genetic and nongenetic (e.g. maternal effects) means, are likely a contributing factor to the continued maintenance of distinct life history strategies of brown trout.  2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

As part of this, we assessed the contributions and importance of hierarchical levels of biological organization [ancestral type (native vs. hatchery-introgressed), population, and family] to variability in mass and RMR of fry. As embryos and alevin, individuals were reared at either natural environmental (5C) or elevated (9C) temperatures and then acclimated to either matched or mismatched temperature treatments once yolk sacs were resorbed. Mass differences among fry were strongly influenced by population of origin as well as initial rearing and final acclimation temperatures. Variation in mass-adjusted RMR of fry was also strongly accounted for by source population, acclimation temperature, and individual mass. A significant interaction between population RMR and final acclimation temperature indicated that not all brook trout populations responded the same way to temperature changes. In contrast to expectations, the highest ancestry category (native vs. introgressed) did not significantly influence mass or mass-adjusted RMR.  The Author(s) 2018."

Testosterone varies seasonally, peaking when competition for mates is high and declining during parental care. Surprisingly, little is known about how testosterone mediates social conflict and parental care behavior in highly social species like cooperative breeders, where group members compete for breeding opportunities and provide parental or alloparental care. We examined how testosterone differs across breeding roles in the tropical cooperatively breeding superb starling, Lamprotornis superbus. We determined whether testosterone was elevated in larger groups, and whether testosterone was negatively related to total levels of parental and alloparental care. We found that male breeders had higher testosterone than male helpers and female breeders and helpers during incubation. However, breeding males exhibited a significant decline in testosterone from incubation to chick rearing, and all individuals had similar levels during the chick rearing stage. Additionally, helpersbut not breedersin large social groups had higher testosterone than those in small groups. Finally, testosterone was not correlated with nestling provisioning rates during chick rearing, suggesting that natural variation in the low levels of testosterone observed during periods of high parental care does not affect nestling provisioning. Together, these results offer insight into how testosterone is related to breeding roles, intra-group conflict, and parental care in a highly social species.  2017 Elsevier Inc."

By studying avian distress behaviors we aimed to broaden our understanding of the relationship between coping styles and urbanization. Using a large-scale comparative study of seven paired rural and urban sites across Europe, we assayed distress behaviors during handling of urban and rural-dwelling populations of the great tit Parus major. We detected no consistent pairwise differences in breath rate between urban and rural habitats. However, urban great tits displayed more distress calling (fear screams) and higher pecking rate (handling aggression) than rural birds. These findings suggest that urban great tits have a more proactive coping strategy when dealing with stressful conditions. This finding is in line with previous studies implying that urban great tits are more explorative, less neophobic, and display shorter flight distances than their rural counterparts, representing further aspects of the same ""proactive,"" coping strategy.

Here, the influence of directional warming and increasing climate variability on marine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) offspring size variation was investigated by simulating changes to the mean and variance of ocean temperatures predicted under climate change. Reproductive traits of mothers and offspring size reaction norms across four climate scenarios were examined to assess the roles of standing genetic variation, transgenerational and within-generation plasticity in adaptive potential. Mothers acclimated to directional warming produced smaller eggs than mothers in constant, ambient temperatures, whereas mothers in a predictably variable environment (weekly change between temperatures) produced a range of egg sizes, possibly reflecting a diversified bet hedging strategy. Offspring size post-hatch was mostly influenced by genotype by environment interactions and not transgenerational effects. Offspring size reaction norms also differed depending on the type of environmental predictability (predictably variable vs. stochastic), with offspring reaching the largest sizes in the stochastic environment. Release of cryptic genetic variation for offspring size in the stochastic environment suggests hidden evolutionary potential in this wild population to respond to changes in environmental predictability.  2017 The Author(s)."

According to life history theory, prehatching investment, in turn, trades off with posthatching investment, as the amount of resources allocated at the prehatching stage diminishes the resources available at the posthatching stage. As small eggs have smaller energy reserves than large eggs, the offspring originating from small eggs may have higher hunger levels, and thus beg more, offering the parents information about the need for more posthatching care. However, little is known about the relationship between egg size and begging behaviour, and the fitness correlates of the two. In this study, we directly investigated the association between these two traits in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. Concurrently, we examined the effects of egg size on two components of offspring fitness: offspring growth and survival. We found no association between egg size and offspring begging behaviour. Egg size did, however, show a mostly positive, albeit indirect, association with offspring fitness traits (development time, size and survival).

To better understand the response of clutch phenology to annual and long-term changes in climate, we studied a population of Sonoran Desert Tortoises (Gopherus morafkai) in Arizona in 1993 and 1997-2005, specifically quantifying three phenophases, including (1) the estimated time of appearance of shelled eggs in females, (2) the estimated time that eggs were last visible in X-radiographs, and (3) the duration of the interval between the first two events. The mean date for appearance of shelled eggs was 6 June, and the mean date they were last visible was 26 June. After controlling for individual female effects, these dates were different among years. The total number of days that eggs were visible across all females within a year differed among years, but the mean duration of time that clutches were visible, after controlling for individual female effects, was similar among years. Three of 18 females exhibited interannual egg retention on 5 occasions from 52 clutches. Although G. morafkai ovulates only one clutch per year, they might oviposit up to two because of interannual egg retention.

Despite over 50 years of study, it is unclear why, ultimately, most birds initiate embryonic development (incubation) before all eggs are laid. One hypothesis focuses on prehatching (embryo) survival and predicts that early incubation maximizes embryo survival by reducing exposure of unincubated eggs (egg viability hypothesis). Another set of hypotheses focuses on posthatching growth and survival and predicts that females time incubation to maximize the number or quality of hatched offspring that fledge (adaptive hatching pattern hypotheses). I experimentally manipulated when females could begin incubation to test how timing of embryonic development influences prehatching survival and posthatching growth and survival in the house sparrow, Passer domesticus. Despite high embryo survival in both naturally asynchronous and experimentally synchronized nests, early incubation appeared to maximize embryo survival in all but the earliest-laid eggs, suggesting that house sparrows begin incubation too late to maximize survival of all embryos. Early incubation had little effect on overall (i.e. mean) patterns of posthatching growth and survival. However, early incubation increased the initial variation in offspring size because last-hatched young were relatively small when all eggs had completed hatching. Nestlings that were small at hatch completion grew slowly and exhibited a reduced probability of survival, suggesting that house sparrows begin incubation too early to maximize growth and survival of hatched offspring. These results suggest that timing of incubation neither maximizes embryo survival nor maximizes posthatching growth and survival. Instead, early incubation appears to be a trade-off between maintaining both embryo survival and growth and survival of late-hatched offspring. Thus, house sparrow females likely time incubation as an adaptive strategy to maximize the number of embryos that survive the incubation and nestling periods to fledge.  2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour"

Exposure to 5002000 M NH4Cl for 16 h did not affect the gene expression of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system components in 1 day post-fertilization (dpf) embryos, but differentially increased crfa, crfb and CRF binding protein (crfbp) expression and stimulated both dose- and time-dependent increases in the whole body cortisol of 5 dpf larvae. Pre-acclimation to HEA at 1 dpf did not affect the cortisol response to a subsequent NH4Cl exposure at 5 dpf. In contrast, pre-acclimation to HEA at 5 dpf caused a small but significant reduction in the cortisol response to a second NH4Cl exposure at 10 dpf. While continuous exposure to 5002000 M NH4Cl between 0 and 5 dpf had a modest effect on mean survival time, exposure to 4001000 M NH4Cl between 10 and 14 dpf decreased mean survival time in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, pre-acclimation to HEA at 5 dpf significantly decreased the risk of mortality to continuous NH4Cl exposure between 10 and 14 dpf. Finally, while HEA at 1 dpf did not affect the cortisol stress response to a novel vortex stressor at 5 dpf, the same HEA treatment at 5 dpf abolished vortex stressor-induced increases in whole body cortisol at 10 and 60 dpf. Together these results show that the impact of HEA on the cortisol stress response during development is life-stage specific and closely linked to ammonia tolerance. Further, we demonstrate that HEA exposure at the larval stage can have persistent effects on the capacity to respond to stressors in later life.  2017 Elsevier Inc."

We conducted an experiment to discern if maternal and embryonic stressors affect the behavior of hatchlings of the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis, a species with features that allow for the examination of these stress types in isolation. Separating the impact of stress transmitted through the mother vs. stress experienced by the embryo itself will help clarify the behavioral findings in viviparous species for which it is impossible to disentangle these effects. We also compared the effect of a naturally-occurring (predator cue) and an ""artificial"" (bright, randomly-occurring LED light) embryonic stressor. This allowed us to test the hypothesis that a threat commonly faced by a species (natural threat) would be met with a genetically-programmed and adaptive response while a novel one would confound innate defense mechanisms and lead to maladaptive effects. We found that the maternal stressor was associated with significant differences in body patterning and activity patterns. By contrast, embryonic exposure to stressors increased the proportion of individuals that pursued prey. From these results, it appears that in cuttlefish, maternal and embryonic stressors affect different post-natal behavior in offspring. In addition, the effect of the artificial stressor suggests that organisms can sometimes react adaptively to a stressor even if it is not one that has been encountered during the evolutionary history of the species.  2017 O'Brien, Jozet-Alves, Mezrai, Bellanger, Darmaillacq and Dickel."

Reproduction is one of the most demanding activities in terms of energy, and costs related to reproduction can be apparent either as reduced future reproduction or as survival. However, costs are not always detected, because individual heterogeneity in quality and resource acquisition may explain variation in costs among individuals. We conducted a comprehensive study in spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor) nesting in Central Spain to determine whether costs of reproduction could be detectable in the short and/or long term and whether prenatal or postnatal investment were driving these costs. We took into account the lifehistory of the species, where egg volume is highly repeatable, males are facultatively polygynous, and intraspecific brood parasitism occurs. Females with a high reproductive effort in a breeding event also had a high reproductive effort in the second event of the season. The mating system and maternal age were reliable predictors of breeding success within a breeding event: monogamous and primary females, as well as older mothers, raised more nestlings than secondary females and 1-year-old females, respectively. However, when high-investing females suffered intra-brood parasitism in 1 year, we found a negative correlation between current and futurereproduction. These results suggest that, under some circumstances, females are able to skip the short-term costs of reproduction, but when extra effort is added, trade-offs arise. While most studies have focused on different aspects of individual quality on costs, the ecological context seems to represent an important component that should be taken into account.  2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany."

In our first experiment, chicks begged significantly longer in response to the odour of their genetic mother or father compared to the odour of a non-relative of the same sex and reproductive status. In a second experiment, we cross-fostered eggs and tested the response of hatchlings to the scent of genetic vs. foster parents. Chicks from cross-fostered eggs responded significantly more to the odour of their genetic mother than their foster mother, but exhibited no difference in response to genetic vs. foster fathers. This is the first evidence that embryonic altricial birds are capable of acquiring chemosensory knowledge of their parents during early development, and retain chemical familiarity with their genetic mother despite egg cross-fostering.

This effect of early environmental conditions is a potentially important mechanism by which animals can compensate for the negative impacts of climate change. In this study, we experimentally tested whether three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) change their maternal strategy according to environmental temperatures experienced earlier in life. We studied maternal investment from a life-history perspective because females are expected to adjust their reproductive strategy in relation to their current and future reproductive returns as well as offspring fitness. Results: F1 families were reared in control and elevated winter temperatures and their reproductive trajectories were studied when returned to common conditions. Females that had experienced the warm winter treatment (n = 141) had a lower fecundity and reduced breeding and total lifespan compared to the control individuals (n = 159). Whereas the control females tended to produce their heaviest and largest clutches in their first reproductive attempt, the warm-acclimated females invested less in their first clutch, but then produced increasingly heavy clutches over the course of the breeding season. Egg mass increased with clutch number at a similar rate in the two groups. The warm-acclimated females increased the investment of carotenoids in the first and last clutches of the season. Thus, any transgenerational effects of the maternal thermal environment on offspring phenotype may be mediated by the allocation of antioxidants into eggs but not by egg size. Conclusions: Our results indicate that conditions experienced by females during juvenile life have a profound effect on life-time maternal reproductive strategies. The temperature-induced changes in maternal strategy may be due to constraints imposed by the higher energetic costs of a warm environment, but it is possible that they allow the offspring to compensate for higher energetic costs and damage when they face the same thermal stress as did their mothers.  2017 The Author(s)."

While studies have shown that this drug affects juvenile fish behavior, little is known about the developmental impact on nontarget aquatic animals. We tested the hypothesis that venlafaxine deposition in the egg, mimicking maternal transfer of this antidepressant, disrupts developmental programming using zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model. Embryos (1-4 cell stage) were microinjected with either 1 or 10 ng venlafaxine, which led to a rapid reduction (90%) of this drug in the embryo at hatch. There was a concomitant increase in the concentration of the major metabolite o-desmethylvenlafaxine during the same period. Embryonic exposure to venlafaxine accelerated early development, increased hatching rate and produced larger larvae at 5 days post fertilization. Also, there was an increase in neuronal birth in the hypothalamus, dorsal thalamus, posterior tuberculum, and the preoptic region, and this corresponded with a higher spatial expression of nrd4, a key marker of neurogenesis. The venlafaxine-exposed larvae were less active and covered shorter distance in a light and dark behavioral test compared to the controls. Overall, zygotic exposure to venlafaxine disrupts early development, including brain function, and compromises larval behavior, suggesting impact of this drug on developmental programming in zebrafish.  2017 American Chemical Society."

The present study considers the transgenerational effects of social environment in zebrafish, Danio rerio, an egg-laying animal that shows no parental care, thus removing any influence of parental interaction and allowing the effects of conspecific interaction to be clearly determined. Zebrafish (F0) were reared from fertilization to reproduction in three different social treatments: isolation, groups of 30 or groups of 100. At 28 days post fertilization, individuals were tested for anxiety and activity and at 3 months old for aggression. These F0 fish were raised to sexual maturity and bred within their treatment group. The F1 generation were then raised in groups of 30, irrespective of parental social environment and were assessed for behaviour in the same way as their parents. Social isolation increased anxiety and decreased aggression in the F0 fish compared to those raised in social groups of 100. F0 fish raised in social groups of 30 showed an intermediate response. Differences in anxiety were not passed to the F1 generation; however, offspring of socially isolated fish were less aggressive than offspring of parents from social groups of 30 and 100.

Here, we tested in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss: (1) whether exposure to alarm cues during embryonic stages engendered developmental plasticity; and (2) whether an abiotic stressor could also orient the behavioural development of fry. We divided fertilized eggs into three groups: a control nonstressed group (Control), a group of embryos exposed to a conspecific alarm pheromone (e.g. predator-related cue stressor, PS), and a group of embryos that were chronically air exposed for 1 min (e.g. abiotic stressor, AS). Stressors were applied once a day, 3 times per week from 19 days postfertilization (dpf) until 52 dpf. Between 57 and 143 dpf, and for each individual, we assessed the propensity to express fear responses in different contexts and learning performances. When exposed to a novel environment or a novel object, PS fish showed significantly less fear-related behaviour, less freezing and higher activity levels than Control fish. PS fish also showed slower acquisition of a learning task than controls. AS fish did not differ from controls in any test situation.

To aid disease detection during the period of captivity, Gough moorhens (n = 43; 25 adult females and 18 adult males) were captured, measured and sampled to determine ease of sexing by morphometrics, to establish reference ranges for routine haematological and biochemical parameters and to identify any intestinal and haemoparasites as well as determine which faecal bacteria were present. Male Gough moorhens had significantly greater mean body mass (P = 0.019) and head and bill length (P = 0.001) compared with females, but the overlapping ranges showed genetic identification of sex was required for accurate determination. Plasma globulin and total protein concentrations were significantly greater in female compared with male birds (P = 0.032 and P = 0.012, respectively) and probably related to egg yolk production. No haemoparasites or gastrointestinal parasites were found in any bird and there were no sex-related differences in the haematology.

During the energetic challenge induced by a stressful environment, corticosterone stimulates energy intake and a preference for a high-fat diet by up-regulating nEuropeptide Y (NPY) expression via the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. The elevated corticosterone levels in response to stressors may be associated with suppressed reproduction in laying hens via a possible perturbation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis.

Baseline and stress-induced cortisol concentrations, body size (i.e. length and mass), and behavior (i.e. anxiety, exploration, boldness, and aggression) were assessed at different offspring life-stages and compared between offspring of control and cortisol-treated females. Cortisol administration did not affect spawning success or timing, nor were whole-body cortisol concentrations different between embryos from cortisol-treated and control females. However, maternal cortisol treatment had significant effects on offspring stress responsiveness, mass, and behavior. Compared to offspring of control females, offspring of cortisol-treated females exhibited larger mass right after hatch, and young-of-the-year mounted an attenuated cortisol response to an acute stressor, and exhibited less thigmotaxic anxiety, exploratory behavior, boldness and aggression. Thus, offspring phenotype was affected by elevated maternal cortisol levels despite the absence of a significant increase in embryo cortisol concentrations, suggesting that a mechanism other than the direct deposition of cortisol into eggs mediates effects on offspring.

These intrinsic differences between early and late eggs could be driven by changes in resource availability to females, which are then passively passed onto the egg. Alternatively, it may be due to an anticipatory maternal effect, wherein some signal or resource is actively placed within the egg, which is beneficial to those eggs laid late within the clutch. In order to distinguish between these hypotheses we designed a supplementary feeding experiment, wherein females were provided with food at certain times during the laying phase. This had no discernible effect on development rate, or other egg characteristics, consistent with anticipatory maternal effects. Using a larger dataset we also tested whether natural environmental variation (weather) during egg formation affected maternal investment in eggs. Similarly, egg characteristics were found to be relatively insensitive to the environmental variation, supporting the experimental results.

Birds with multiple eggs in a single clutch often begin incubating when most eggs are laid, thereby reducing time of incubation, nursing burden, and sibling competition. In some songbirds and some other species, however, incubation starts immediately after the first egg is laid, and the chicks thus hatch asynchronously. This may result in differences in parental care and in sibling competition based on body size differences among older and younger chicks, which in turn might produce asynchronous development among siblings favoring the first hatchling, and further affect the development and fitness of the chicks after fledging. To determine whether such processes in fact occur in the zebra finch, we observed chick development in 18 clutches of zebra finches. We found that there were effects of asynchronous hatching, but these were smaller than expected and mostly not significant. Our observations suggest that the amount of care given to each chick may be equated with such factors as a camouflage effect of the down feathers, and that the low illumination within the nest also complicates the determination of the hatching order by the parents.  2017 Zoological Society of Japan."

In birds, differential maternal allocation and investment in their progeny lead to variance in the environmental conditions that offspring experience during growth within the brood. In particular, laying and hatching order have been proposed to influence individual quality during the growing period, but little is known about the fitness consequences that these two factors have for offspring from a lifetime perspective. We explored the effect of laying and hatching order on post-fledgling survival (measured as recruitment probability) and lifetime reproductive success (LRS) in Common Kestrels Falco tinnunculus, using a long-term and individual-based dataset. First-hatched chicks showed higher survival probability and LRS than their siblings. This effect was not due to body condition of the individuals at adulthood, the quality of their mates or the reproductive outcome compared with later-hatched individuals. Instead, first-hatched chicks had a higher recruitment probability. This could be explained by the higher body condition attained by first-hatched chicks at the end of the nesting period, perhaps due to an enhanced competitive advantage for food over their siblings at the time of hatching. Laying order, in contrast to hatching order, appeared to have little or no effect on LRS. Our results suggest that hatching order within siblings predicts fitness, and that better early-life conditions during growth experienced by first-hatched chicks improve first survival and then recruitment, resulting in an enhanced LRS.  2017 British Ornithologists Union"

Reproduction is presumed to be costly for parents through several routes, including increased oxidative stress, particularly for bird species producing large clutches. If dietary antioxidants can ameliorate oxidative stress associated with reproduction, mothers supplemented with dietary antioxidants are predicted to be in improved condition and/or invest more resources in reproduction than controls. We provided adult blue tit pairs with an -tocopherol-enriched or control food supplement during nest building and egg laying, then cross-fostered half broods between treatment groups to test the theory that -tocopherol-supplemented mothers would invest more in self-maintenance or reproduction than controls. We found that -tocopherol supplementation had no effect on the maternal condition or reproductive investment. However, effects on nestlings were evident: nestlings from -tocopherol-supplemented mothers were smaller at hatching. There was no effect on chick fledging mass, fledging success or lipid peroxidation, but the catch-up growth exhibited by chicks from -tocopherolsupplemented parents may be considered costly.

We targeted the gilthead sea bream, which develops a condition known as winter syndrome when it is exposed to low water temperatures. Eggs and larvae of sea bream were exposed to four different thermal regimes and then the response of the resulting adults to a low temperature challenge was assessed. Sea bream exposed to a high-low thermal regime as eggs and larvae (HLT; 22C until hatch and then 18C until larvae-juvenile transition) had increased plasma cortisol and lower sodium and potassium in response to a cold challenge compared with the other thermal history groups. Plasma glucose and osmolality were increased in coldchallenged HLT fish relative to the unchallenged HLT fish. Cold challenge modified bone homeostasis/responsiveness in the low-high thermal regime group (LHT) relative to other groups, and ocn, ogn1/2, igf1, gr and tra/ transcripts were all downregulated. In the low temperature group (LT) and HLT group challenged with a low temperature, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activities were decreased relative to unchallenged groups, and bone calcium content also decreased in the LT group. Overall, the results indicate that thermal imprinting during early development of sea bream causes a change in the physiological response of adults to a cold challenge.  2017.

Environmental stressors activate the neuroendocrine stress axis (hypothalamuspituitaryinterrenal axis, HPI) leading to an acute increase in CORT, which in turn, helps in coping with particular stress. However, chronic increase in CORT can negatively affect other physiological processes such as growth and metamorphosis. Herein, we studied the effect of exogenous CORT on larval growth, antipredator behaviour and metamorphic traits of Hylarana indica. Embryonic exposure to 5 or 20 g/L CORT did not affect their development, hatching duration as well as larval growth and metamorphosis. Exposure of tadpoles to 10 or 20 g/L CORT throughout larval development caused slower growth and development leading to increased body mass at stage 37. However, body and tail morphology of tadpoles was not affected. Interestingly, larval exposure to 5, 10 or 20 g/L CORT enhanced their antipredator response against kairomones in a concentration-dependent manner. Further, larval exposure to increasing concentrations of CORT resulted in the emergence of heavier froglets at 10 and 20 g/L while, delaying metamorphosis at all concentrations. Interestingly, the heavier froglets had shorter hindlimbs and consequently shorter jump distances. Tadpoles exposed to 20 g/L CORT during early, mid or late larval stages grew and developed slowly but tadpole morphology was not altered. Interestingly, exposure during early or mid-larval stages resulted in an enhanced antipredator response. These individuals metamorphosed later but at higher body mass while SVL was unaffected.  2016 Elsevier Inc."

Our aim is to emphasize the importance of the ecological and evolutionary context within which adaptive hypotheses of maternal stress can be evaluated. We present five primary research areas where we think future research can make substantial progress: (1) understanding maternal and offspring control mechanisms that modulate exposure between maternal stress and subsequent offspring phenotype response; (2) understanding the dynamic nature of the interaction between mothers and their environment; (3) integrating offspring phenotypic responses and measuring both maternal and offspring fitness outcomes under real-life (either free-living or semi-natural) conditions; (4) empirically testing these fitness outcomes across relevant spatial and temporal environmental contexts (both pre- and postnatal environments); (5) examining the role of maternal stress effects in human-altered environments-i.e., do they limit or enhance fitness.

To test this proposition, we assessed female zebra finches' preferences for males banded with red or green plastic leg bands and then tested the sex allocation pattern of females paired with preferred and non-preferred males. Although most females preferred redbanded males, 34% of females consistently preferred green-banded males. The sex ratio at laying and hatching was not influenced by paternal preferred status. However, the fledging sex ratios differed between females paired with preferred and non-preferred males due to sex-biased chick mortality; sons of females paired with preferred males were born heavier and were more likely to survive than daughters. Our results indicate that female zebra finches show individual variation in their preferences for colour banded males, although females do not seem to adjust the offspring sex ratio in response to their mate's band colour. However, the differential posthatch mortality suggests females may differentially allocate resources into male and female eggs according to their individual mate preferences.  The Author 2017."

Several studies have estimated the heritability of circulating glucocorticoid levels under acute stress conditions, but little is known about the potential for either baseline hormone levels or rapid endocrine flexibility to evolve. Here, we assessed the potential for selection to operate on the elevation (circulating hormone levels) and flexibility of glucocorticoid reaction norms to acute restraint stress. Multivariate animal models revealed low but significant heritability in baseline (h2=0.130.14) and stress-induced glucocorticoids (h2=0.18), and moderate heritability in glucocorticoid flexibility in response to acute stress (h2=0.38) in free-living juvenile tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor; n=408). Baseline glucocorticoids were not genetically correlated with either stress-induced glucocorticoids or glucocorticoid flexibility. These findings indicate that baseline glucocorticoids and the acute stress response are distinct traits that can be independently shaped by selection.

Here, we investigate the variability of the melanic colouration in yellow-legged gull Larus michahellis chicks. In this species, hatchlings show high variability in the number and colour intensity of black spots in their plumage. In gulls, last-laid eggs receive less antioxidants but higher levels of androgens than first eggs. We first explored whether these remarkable differences within the clutch affect the feather melanisation during embryo development. Melanic colouration was not related to laying order, but nestling males were darker and had a larger spotted area than nestling females. In chicks hatching from first-laid eggs, the spot size and spot lightness were negatively correlated. We also explored the effect of the developmental environment, through a cross-fostering experiment, on the expression of five stress-related genes (SOD2, ALKBH3, HSPA8, NLRC5 and TRIAP1) and their link with melanic colouration. Post-hatching hierarchy did not affect the expression of any of the tested genes, but paler chicks showed reduced expression in some studied genes (SOD2, ALKBH3 and HSPA8) in comparison to darker chicks.

In many mammals, males are heterogametic (XY); whereas females are homogametic (XX). In most birds, the opposite is the case with females being heterogametic (ZW) and males the homogametic sex (ZZ). Many reptile species lack sex chromosomes, and instead, sexual differentiation is influenced by temperature with specific temperatures promoting males or females varying across species possessing this form of sexual differentiation, although TSD has recently been shown to override GSD in Australian central beaded dragons (Pogona vitticeps). There has been speculation that Australian Brush-turkeys (Alectura lathami) exhibit TSD alone and/or in combination with GSD. Thus, we sought to determine if this species possesses sex chromosomes. Blood was collected from one sexually mature female and two sexually mature males residing at Sylvan Heights Bird Park (SHBP) and shipped for karyotype analysis. Karyotype analysis revealed that contrary to speculation, Australian Brush-turkeys possess the classic avian ZW/ZZ sex chromosomes. It remains a possibility that a biased primary sex ratio of Australian Brush-turkeys might be influenced by maternal condition prior to ovulation that result in her laying predominantly Z- or W-bearing eggs and/or sex-biased mortality due to higher sensitivity of one sex in environmental conditions. A better understanding of how maternal and extrinsic factors might differentially modulate ovulation of Z- or W-bearing eggs and hatching of developing chicks possessing ZW or ZZ sex chromosomes could be essential in conservation strategies used to save endangered members of Megapodiidae.  2017 Ortega et al.

Few studies have considered ornament-related own and partner care of both parents and their consequences in relation to environmental conditions. In a brood size manipulation experiment on collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis), we measured nestling feeding rates, white patch sizes and plumage reflectance properties of both parents, and quantified nestling growth and reproductive success. We found little relationship between ornamentation and own feeding rate irrespective of manipulation. Parental quality, measured as nestling biomass production per unit feeding effort, was related to male structural plumage brightness in a manipulation-dependent manner. Male wing patch size and the female's structural plumage brightness were linked to the partner's feeding rate, and this did not vary with experimental environment. Finally, relationship of prefledging nestling size with male forehead patch size was environment-dependent, and this pattern was apparently due to intrinsic nestling characteristics. Reproductive success only partly reflected these findings. Our results indicate how integrated studies of mutual ornamentation and mutual care with environmental and offspring quality may help us better grasp the selection forces shaping sexual ornaments.

Kin selection theory predicts that competing offspring should modify the intensity of their begging depending on the degree of relatedness to their nest- or litter-mates. Empirical evidence in birds, which are a key model in the study of parent-offspring interactions, indeed indicates that a lower level of relatedness between offspring in the nest correlates with more intense begging (i.e. more selfish behaviour). This implies that competing nestlings can recognize kin, but the mechanism underlying such discrimination is unclear. Birds have long been thought to mainly rely on visual and auditory cues in their social communication, but there is now growing evidence for the importance of olfactory cues too. To assess the potential importance of olfactory cues in modulating nestling begging behaviour, we experimentally tested in a free-living bird, the blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus, if nestlings discriminate and adjust their begging behaviour depending on their familiarity with a conspecific nestling odour stimulus. We found that individuals responded with longer and more intense begging bouts to an unfamiliar compared with a familiar odour stimulus. Our findings provide first evidence for a role of olfaction in modulating offspring begging behaviour in a wild bird population. Although our experiment cannot differentiate between the effects of familiarity and relatedness, it raises the interesting possibility that blue tit nestlings may also discriminate between odours of close kin and less related individuals, and adjust their begging behaviour accordingly. This hypothesis requires further testing. A lay summary is available for this article.  2017 The Authors. Functional Ecology  2017 British Ecological Society"

Activation of the neuroendocrine axis that regulates the response to stress can have consequences for innumerable behavioural responses, including social decision-making and aspects of sociality, such as gregariousness and aggression. This is especially true for stress experienced during early life, when physiological systems are developing and highly sensitive to perturbation. Stress at this time can have persistent effects on social behaviours into adulthood. One important question remaining is to what extent these effects are adaptive. This paper initially reviews the current literature investigating the complex relationships between the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and other neuroendocrine systems and several aspects of social behaviour in vertebrates. In addition, the review explores the evidence surrounding the potential for social programming via differential development and activation of the HPA axis, providing an insight into the potential for positive effects on fitness following early life stress. Finally, the paper provides a framework from which novel investigations could work to fully understand the adaptive significance of early life effects on social behaviours.  2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Environmental conditions can mediate this variation in the strength of inbreeding depression, with environmental stress exacerbating the negative consequences of inbreeding. Parents can modify the environment experienced by offspring, and have thus the potential to mitigate the negative consequences of inbreeding. While such parental effects have recently been demonstrated during the postnatal period, the role of prenatal parental effects in influencing the expression of inbreeding depression remains unexplored. To address this gap, we performed matings between full-sibs or unrelated individuals in replicated lines of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) experimentally selected for high and low maternal egg provisioning. We show that in the low maternal investment lines hatching success was strongly reduced when parents were related. In the high maternal investment lines, however, this negative effect of inbreeding on hatching success was absent, demonstrating that prenatal maternal provisioning can alleviate the negative fitness consequences of inbreeding.  2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

It is largely unclear whether intraspecific variation in embryonic development time that is not caused by environmental differences occurs, which would be required to detect life-history trade-offs. Here we performed a classical common-garden experiment by incubating fresh eggs of free-living common terns (Sterna hirundo) in a controlled incubation environment at two different temperatures. Hatching success was high but was slightly lower at the lower temperature. While correcting for effects of year, incubation temperature, and laying order, we found significant variation in the incubation time embryos required until hatching and in their heart rate. Embryonic heart rate was significantly positively correlated within clutches, and a similar tendency was found for incubation time, suggesting that intrinsic differences in embryonic development rate between offspring of different parents exist. Incubation time and embryonic heart rate were strongly correlated: embryos with faster heart rates required shorter incubation time. However, after correction for heart rate, embryos still required more time for development at the lower incubation temperature. This suggests that processes other than development require a greater share of resources in a suboptimal environment and that relative resource allocation to development is, therefore, environment dependent. We conclude that there is opportunity to detect intraspecific life-history trade-offs with embryonic development time and that the resolution of trade-offs may differ between embryonic environments.  2017 by The University of Chicago.

Missing from this deficit approach is an attempt to leverage the unique strengths and abilities that develop in response to high-stress environments. Evolutionary-developmental models emphasize the coherent, functional changes that occur in response to stress over the life course. Research in birds, rodents, and humans suggests that developmental exposures to stress can improve forms of attention, perception, learning, memory, and problem solving that are ecologically relevant in harsh-unpredictable environments (as per the specialization hypothesis). Many of these skills and abilities, moreover, are primarily manifest in currently stressful contexts where they would provide the greatest fitness-relevant advantages (as per the sensitization hypothesis). This perspective supports an alternative adaptation-based approach to resilience that converges on a central question: What are the attention, learning, memory, problem-solving, and decision-making strategies that are enhanced through exposures to childhood adversity? At an applied level, this approach focuses on how we can work with, rather than against, these strengths to promote success in education, employment, and civic life.  2017,  The Author(s) 2017."

By contrast, relatively little attention has been paid to avian bare parts such as exposed skin, bills, feet, and combs, despite considerable variation in structure and coloration within and between species. To better understand the potential signaling role of bare parts, we conducted a comprehensive literature search that returned 321 published studies. In reviewing these studies, we found that (1) bare-part color is widely distributed taxonomically and is produced by diverse mechanisms; (2) many bare parts are likely to be dynamic, honest signals of current condition or status and can also reflect genetic makeup and early developmental conditions; and (3) bare parts can function as pluripotent social signals, mediating interactions between competitors, mates, and kin. Differences between bare parts and plumage in phenology and information content support a multiple-messages interpretation of their respective signaling roles, in that bare parts may contain information that is complementary to, but distinctive from, information conveyed by plumage-based signals. We consider it likely that a great deal of bare-part variation is ""hidden in plain sight,"" in that meaningful variation may not be recorded by many current studies.

Here, we manipulated environmental conditions during development (small vs. large brood size, and hence sibling competition) and in adulthood (easy vs. hard foraging conditions) in a full factorial design in zebra finches, and studied effects on baseline (Bas-CORT) and stress-induced (SI-CORT) corticosterone in adulthood. Treatments affected Bas-CORT in females, but not in males. Females reared in small broods had intermediate Bas-CORT levels as adults, regardless of foraging conditions in adulthood, while females reared in large broods showed higher Bas-CORT levels in hard foraging conditions and lower levels in easy foraging conditions. Female Bas-CORT was also more susceptible than male Bas-CORT to non-biological variables, such as ambient temperature. In line with these results, repeatability of Bas-CORT was higher in males (up to 51%) than in females (25%). SI-CORT was not responsive to the experimental manipulations in either sex and its repeatability was high in both sexes. We conclude that Bas-CORT responsiveness to intrinsic and extrinsic conditions is higher in females than in males, and that the expression of developmental conditions may depend on the adult environment.

We outline expectations based on the assumption that telomere maintenance is costly and argue that individual heterogeneity in resource acquisition is predicted to lead to positive covariance between growth and telomere length. However, canalization of resource allocation to the trait with a larger effect on fitness, rendering that trait relatively invariant, can cause the absence of covariance. In a case study of common tern (Sterna hirundo) chicks, in which hatching order is the main determinant of variation in resource acquisition within broods, we find that body mass, but not telomere length or attrition, varies with hatching order. Moreover, body mass and growth positively predict survival to fledging, whereas telomere length and attrition do not. Using a novel statistical method to quantify standardized variance in plasticity, we estimate between-individual variation in telomere attrition to be only 12% of that of growth. Consistent with the relative invariance of telomere attrition, we find no correlation between age-specific body mass or growth and telomere attrition. We suggest that common tern chicks prioritize investment in long-term somatic state (as indicated by canalization of telomere maintenance) over immediate survival benefits of growth as part of an efficient brood reduction strategy that benefits the parents. As such, interspecific variation in the growthtelomere length relationship may be explained by the extent to which parents benefit from rapid mortality of excess offspring.  2017 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

Most theoretical and empirical work on the resolution of this conflict has focused on strategies used by both parents, such as negotiation. However, because females produce the eggs, this might afford females with an ability to manipulate male behavior via maternal effects that alter offspring phenotypes. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated the prenatal conditions (i.e., presence or absence of the male), performed a cross-fostering experiment, and monitored the subsequent effects of prenatal conditions on offspring and parental performance in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. We found that offspring were smaller at hatching when females laid eggs in presence of a male, suggesting that females invest less in eggs when expecting male assistance. Furthermore, broods laid in the presence of a male gained more weight during parental care, and they did so at the expense of male weight gain. Contrary to our expectations, males cared less for broods laid in the presence of a male. Our results provide experimental evidence that females can alter male behavior during breeding by adjusting maternal effects according to prenatal conditions. However, rather than increasing the male's parental effort, females appeared to suppress the male's food consumption, thereby leaving more food for their brood."

Female cowbirds thus have limited options for impacting their offsprings development via maternal effects compared to most other passerines. Cowbirds can impact their offsprings phenotype by choosing among potential host nests, and by adjusting egg resources based on host characteristics. To examine whether cowbirds exhibit either or both of these strategies, we investigated rates of cowbird parasitism and egg investment (egg size, yolk-to-albumen ratio, and yolk testosterone and androstenedione) among and within host species in a shrubland bird community. We found that the probability of being parasitized by cowbirds, controlling for host status as a cowbird egg accepter or rejecter and ordinal date, varied significantly among host species, indicating an apparent preference for some hosts. Parasitism rates did not differ with host size, however, and despite variation in cowbird egg size among host species, this variation was not related to host size or cowbird preference. Among host species with eggs that are larger than those of the cowbird, cowbirds were significantly more likely to parasitize nests with relatively smaller eggs, whereas parasitism rates did not vary with relative egg size in host species with smaller eggs.

Glucuronidation and sulfation of 4-nitrophenol were used to evaluate the activities. Porcine hepatic UGT and SULT activities were low at birth, peaked at around 510weeks, and then declined. Both hepatic UGT and SULT activities of chickens were high at hatch and declined. Chicken hepatic UGT activity had a peak at the age of 28days. Affinity of hepatic SULT to 4-nitrophenol is similar in chickens and pigs, but the affinity of hepatic UGT in pigs was about 10 times higher than that in chickens. 4-nitrophenol was predominantly conjugated by SULT instead of UGT in chicken livers from hatch to day 56. Conversely, hepatic UGT contributed predominantly in 4-nitrophenol conjugation than the SULT in pigs from birth to 20weeks.

Changes in immune function, a common result of stress, were also evaluated using histomorphometric measurements of melanomacrophages centers (MMCs) in the head kidney and by monitoring macrophage-related transcripts. Thermal history significantly modified the HPI responsiveness in adult sea bream when eggs and larvae were reared at a higher than optimal temperature (HT, 22C), and they had a reduced amplitude in their cortisol response and significantly upregulated pituitary pomc and head kidney star transcripts. Additionally, after an acute stress challenge, immune function was modified and the head kidney of adult fish reared during development at high temperatures (HT and LHT, 18-22C) had a decreased number of MMCs and a significant downregulation of dopachrome tautomerase. Thermal imprinting during development influenced adult sea bream physiology and increased plasma levels of glucose and sodium even in the absence of an acute stress in fish reared under a high-low thermal regime (HLT, 22-18C).

To further test the ICHH, we examined the effects of T on cutaneous wound healing, an integrative measure of immunity, using male Allegheny Mountain dusky salamanders; a species that has sexually dimorphic courtship glands and testosterone-dependent mating behavior. We did this via two methodssurgical manipulation and transdermal delivery of T. In both experiments, elevated plasma T did not delay wound healing.

However, few studies investigate all of these aspects at once. The present study housed female Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) in pairs or groups to examine the effects on hormone concentrations in plasma and yolk and on reproductive performance. Circulating levels of androgens (testosterone and 5--dihydrotestosterone) and corticosterone were measured in baseline samples and after standardised challenges to assess the responsiveness of the females' endocrine axes. Effects of the social environment on female fecundity were analysed by measuring egg production, egg mass, fertilization rates, and number of hatched offspring. Counter to expectation, females housed in pairs had higher plasma androgen concentrations and slightly higher corticosterone concentrations than females housed in groups, although the latter was not statistically significant. Pair vs. group housing did not affect the females' hormonal response to standardised challenges or yolk testosterone levels. In contrast to previous studies, the females' androgen response to a gonadotropin-releasing hormone challenge was not related to yolk testosterone levels. Non-significant trends emerged for pair-housed females to have higher egg-laying rates and higher fertility, but no differences arose in egg weight or in the number, weight or size of hatchlings. We propose that our unexpected findings are due to differences in the adult sex ratio in our social treatments. In pairs, the male may stimulate female circulating hormone levels more strongly than in groups where effects are diluted due to the presence of several females. Future studies should vary both group size and sex composition to disentangle the significance of sexual, competitive and affiliative social interactions for circulating and yolk hormone levels, and their consequences for subsequent generations.  2017 Langen et al.

Observed patterns in both species differed from the predictions of OES in several ways. Mean egg size increased with maternal body size in both species. Mean egg size was inversely related to clutch order in G.agassizii, a strategy more consistent with the within-generation hypothesis arising out of bet-hedging theory or a constraint in egg investment due to resource availability, and contrary to theories of density dependence, which posit that increasing hatchling competition from later season clutches should drive selection for larger eggs. We provide empirical evidence that one species, G.agassizii, employs a bet-hedging strategy that is a combination of two different bet-hedging hypotheses. Additionally, we found some evidence for G.morafkai employing a conservative bet-hedging strategy. (e.g., lack of intra- and interclutch variation in egg size relative to body size). Our novel adaptive hypothesis suggests the possibility that natural selection favors smaller offspring in late-season clutches because they experience a more benign environment or less energetically challenging environmental conditions (i.e., winter) than early clutch progeny, that emerge under harsher and more energetically challenging environmental conditions (i.e., summer). We also discuss alternative hypotheses of sexually antagonistic selection, which arise from the trade-offs of son versus daughter production that might have different optima depending on clutch order and variation in temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) among clutches. Resolution of these hypotheses will require long-term data on fitness of sons versus daughters as a function of incubation environment, data as yet unavailable for any species with TSD.  2017 The Authors.

However, because breeding experience and prenatal maternal investment in reproduction often covary, the source of these age-related differences can be difficult to determine. In this study, we evaluated the influence of prenatal maternal effects and postnatal breeding experience on the performance of nestling tree swallows Tachycineta bicolor by conducting a carefully controlled partial cross-fostering experiment. We swapped half-broods of nestlings between the nest of a young first-time breeding female and the nest of a female known to have previously raised and fledged young. Our manipulation did not influence the within-brood nestling hierarchies, and controlled for the effects of egg laying order. We found that nestlings of older females were heavier just prior to fledging regardless of the breeding experience of the attending female. In addition, fledglings raised by experienced females grew their flight feathers faster, and had greater probability of fledging. Our study demonstrates that prenatal investment in reproduction by older females can have long-term consequences on nestling mass, and suggests limited potential for compensatory mass gains prior to fledging. Because our analyses controlled for feeding rates, our results also suggest that foraging quantity and quality are not the only benefits nestlings gain by being raised by an experienced female.  2016 The Authors"

Immediately prior to, and for up to 28 days post trawling, all females were measured for body mass (BM), sex steroid concentrations (17- estradiol, progesterone, testosterone) and granulocyte to lymphocyte (G:L) ratio. At parturition, neonates were measured for total length (TL), BM and G:L ratio. Trawling reduced maternal BM and elevated the G:L ratio for up to 28 days. Trawling did not significantly affect any sex steroid concentrations relative to controls. Neonates from trawled mothers were significantly lower in BM and TL than control animals, and had an elevated G:L ratio. Our results show that capture of pregnant T. dumerilii can influence their reproductive potential and affect the fitness of neonates.

Reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) are a powerful system to investigate such maternal effects because offspring phenotype, including sex, can be sensitive to maternal influences such as oestrogens and incubation temperatures. In red-eared slider turtles (Trachemys scripta), concentrations of maternally derived oestrogens and incubation temperatures increase across the nesting season; we wanted to determine if sex ratios shift in a seasonally concordant manner, creating the potential for sex-specific maternal effects, and to define the sex ratio reaction norms under fluctuating temperatures across the nesting season. Eggs from early and late season clutches were incubated under a range of thermally fluctuating temperatures, maternally derived oestradiol concentrations were quantified via radioimmunoassay, and hatchling sex was identified. We found that late-season eggs had higher maternal oestrogen concentrations and were more likely to produce female hatchlings. The sex ratio reaction norm curves systematically varied with season, such that with even a slight increase in temperature (05C), late-season eggs produced up to 49% more females than early-season eggs. We found a seasonal shift in sex ratios which creates the potential for sex-specific phenotypic matches across the nesting season driven by maternal effects.

It is therefore important to accurately partition phenotypic variances into their within- and between-individual components. Partitioning covariances into both components can also inform about underlying mechanistic pathways that potentially interlink trait expression. In the current study, we applied such a (co)variance partitioning approach to test key predictions of two central hypotheses in behavioral ecology, namely the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis and the challenge hypothesis. To this end, we assessed potential pleiotropic effects of testosterone on male sexual signaling, immune function, and parental care. We here repeatedly measured a set of relevant traits in 47 breeding pairs of captive canaries (Serinus canaria). We found that a within-individual increase in female testosterone level suppressed immune function. Furthermore, testosterone levels were positively related to male song repertoire size as an important component of sexual signaling at the between-male level. These were, however, the only relevant significant correlations. Overall, our data do therefore not convincingly support the hypotheses tested and suggest rather limited hormonal pleiotropic effects of testosterone on immune function, parental care, and male sexual signaling, at least in our study system. Significance statement: Phenotypic variances and covariances can nowadays be partitioned easily into within- and between-individual components. These components inform about trait repeatability and the extent to which multiple traits form phenotypic suites of traits, as well as about their joint underlying mechanistic pathways. Testosterone for example, may be key to mediate the expression of suites of traits in many vertebrate species. We here used captive canaries and repeatedly measured male and female traits, relevant in the context of endocrinology, sexual signaling, immune function, and parental investment. For both sexes, we report particularly weak correlations between testosterone and all other measured traits at both within- and between-individual levels. Our case study thus questions the pleiotropic effects of testosterone, but exemplifies the applicability and relevance of (co)variance partitioning in behavioral ecological research.  2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

However, for female mate choice, especially, this is poorly known. To complicate matters, both male sexual traits and female mate choice typically show condition dependence, implying that environmental effects probably play an important synergistic role. Using a cross-fostering design, we therefore aimed to disentangle genetic, environmental and their potential interacting effects to investigate how they affect the expression of a sexually selected trait (here birdsong) and female mate choice. To assess environmental effects, we focused on the role of the social environment and thus on learned components. Among the different male song traits investigated, we found a high heritability for song bout length and song bout repertoire, as well as an intriguing gene-by-environment interaction for song bout repertoire. Specifically, the tutor appeared to negatively affect the song bout repertoire of the tutee when his genetic father had a large song bout repertoire but had a positive effect on descendants from fathers with small song bout repertoires. In contrast, we did not detect significant heritability in female mate choice. Female mate choice contained a learned component as females significantly disfavoured their foster father in the mate choice tests, indicating a learned inbreeding avoidance. Thus, our study provides important insights into the role of the social environment for both birdsong and female mate choice. However, the absence of a heritable component in female mate choice suggests a need for studies investigating the heritability of female preferences for (heritable) male song traits in order to gain a better understanding of a potential coevolution between male sexual traits and female mate choice. Overall, our results suggest that indirect genetic effects acting during the pre- and postfledging social contexts may play a prominent role in sexual selection.  2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour"

This entails not only the programmed production of large numbers of eggs, but also high quality eggs with the potential to support normal development and high survival of offspring to juvenile and later stages of development and growth. Numerous studies highlight the maternal contributions to the development of embryos, including transcripts that regulate cell division and determine oocyte polarity, pattern development during early and late embryonic stages and the transition from maternal to zygotic gene expression and translation. Since most fish embryos develop independently within an enclosed egg envelope, they rely on compounds deposited within the oocytes during their various stages of development. In addition to regulatory nucleic acids (maternal DNA and RNA), these include proteins and other compounds that contribute to the structure and function of the egg envelope and the bulk molecular cargo that will be used as a source of cellular energy and structural components for formation of embryos and larvae. These latter components notably include yolk lipids and proteins deposited during oocyte growth and water acquired at the same time and during cytoplasmic maturation. In this review we highlight recent advances made in revealing the transcripts deposited within the oocyte that contribute to the structural and morphological development of the embryo, and to the regulation of gene expression and translation during oocyte development. Significant advances have been made in revealing the molecular mechanisms of lipid accumulation and metabolism within the oocyte, the intricacies of yolk protein formation via endocytosis of multiple yolk precursor proteins by multiple oocyte receptors, and the complex machinery supporting massive accumulation of water by maturing oocytes of many species. Additionally, many advances have been made in our understanding of the endocrine regulation of all of these processes during oogenesis.

We investigated experimentally the relative importance of maternal and own risk perception in multi-trait response of a small planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna to the presence of fish. It appears that maternal effect is involved in shaping some key traits relating to adaptive changes in life history, such as duration time of egg holding in the brood chambers, age and size of mothers at first reproduction, and the number of first-clutch neonates. Other life history parameters, such as duration time of the release of the first clutch of neonates from the brood chamber and the size of neonates, were determined upon direct exposure to environmental risk. The relative contribution of maternal and own perception of risk in shaping individual phenotype depends on the time needed to express particular life history trait.

Here, we assessed whether antioxidant and isotopic composition could underlie these differences between eggs within clutches of southern rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome). The second-laid egg had higher total antioxidant capacity than the first-laid egg, although this was not due to higher antioxidant concentration but to its higher mass. This suggests that resources are allocated by females at a constant rate in both eggs within clutches. Accordingly, we found a strong correlation for isotopic compositions between eggs suggesting that resources were allocated similarly to each egg within the clutch. Overall, we found little evidence for a significant role of antioxidant and isotopic compositions to explain differences in terms of embryo/chick development between eggs in crested penguins. However, since our results suggest a constant rate of antioxidant transfer from females to eggs, limiting the mass of the first-laid egg might represent a strategy for females to spare antioxidant defences and preserve self-maintenance.  2017 Elsevier Inc."

Most studies of birds have investigated the effects of events occurring at early developmental stages on the timing of migration or reproduction, but little is known on the long-term effects of these early events on moulting and plumage quality. We exposed European starling Sturnus vulgaris nestlings to an immune challenge to assess the effects of a developmental stress on the timing of the first (post-juvenile) and second (post-breeding) complete annual moult, the length of the flight feathers, and the length and colouration of ornamental throat feathers. The nestlings were transferred to indoor aviaries before fledgling and kept in captivity until the end of post-breeding moult. Individuals treated with Escherichia coli lypopolysaccharide (LPS) started both moult cycles earlier compared to control siblings. Moult duration was unaffected by the immune challenge, but an advanced moult onset resulted in a longer moult duration. Moreover, female (but not male) throat feather colouration of LPS-injected individuals showed a reduced UV chroma. We argue that an early activation of the immune system caused by LPS may allow nestlings to better cope with post-fledging stresses and lead to an earlier moult onset. The effect of early LPS exposure was remarkably persistent, as it was still visible more than one year after the treatment, and highlighted the importance of early developmental stresses in shaping subsequent major life-history traits, including the timing of moult in birds.  2016 The Authors"

Here we used the commonly parasitized European shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) as a model wild host. Forty live adults from the same colony were sampled.

Microbiota from the significantly distinct proventriculus (site of infection), cloacal and faecal gastrointestinal tract microbiomes were characterised using 16S rRNA gene-targeted high-throughput sequencing. We found increasingly strong associations between helminth infection and microbiota composition progressing away from the site of infection, observing a pronounced dysbiosis in microbiota when samples were partitioned into high- and low-burden groups. We posit this dysbiosis is predominately explained by helminths inducing an anti-inflammatory environment in the proventriculus, diverting host immune responses away from themselves.

As longitudinal studies have accumulated, it has, however, become clear that many avian traits show signs of late-life deterioration. The question of whether birds senesce has therefore been replaced by questions regarding (1) variation in rates of senescence among traits or individuals, (2) the way trait deterioration translates to fitness declines, (3) fitness costs of senescence and (4) processes underlying the observed patterns. While more studies are needed, the first results are intriguing. Within-individual age trajectories often vary among traits, but how varying trait declines translate to fitness declines is still largely unknown. With respect to among-individual variation in rates of senescence, results largely comply with predictions from life history theory: Increased investment in early-life reproduction accelerates senescence. Population-level fitness costs of senescence are low and independent of peak survival rate, such that long-lived species do not experience higher costs of senescence than short-lived species. Whether there is intra-specific variation in fitness costs of senescence, however, remains an open question. It is thus clear that ornitholo-gists are now more than ever in a position to pursue promising investigations into the extent, causes and consequences of individual variation in avian senescence.

Interphyletic comparisons in mammals suggest that male-biased dispersal occurs in polygynous and promiscuous species where local mate competition among males exceeds local resource competition among females. However, few studies have analysed sex-biased patterns of dispersal at the individual level, and facultatively polygynous species might offer this opportunity. In the spotless starling, polygynous males exhibit their mating status during courtship carrying higher amounts of green plants to nests than monogamous males. We experimentally incorporated green plants to nests during four years to analyse long-term consequences on breeding success and offspring recruitment rates. We unexpectedly found that experimental sons recruited farther than experimental daughters, while control daughters recruited farther than control sons. A similar pattern was found using observational information from eight years. We discuss this result in the context of local competition hypothesis and speculate that sons dispersed farther from nests controlled by polygynous males to avoid competition with relatives. The amount of green plants in nests affects female perception of male attractiveness and degree of polygyny, although little is known about proximate mechanisms linking this process with the offspring dispersal behaviour. Our results support the idea that male-biased dispersal is related to polygyny in a facultatively polygynous bird.  2016 The Authors"

Females and their eggs were collected from the field and the eggs incubated in the laboratory for subsequent measurement of MR of females, late-stage embryos, newly-hatched individuals that were nutritionally dependent on yolk, and older hatchlings that had depleted their yolk reserves and thus were independent of energetic contributions from the female. Female identity significantly affected MR of yolk-dependent hatchlings but, after yolk was depleted, MR of offspring converged and no longer reflected the maternal influence. Offspring from different females also differed in size, which influenced offspring MR and growth, but there was no correlation between female MR or size and offspring traits. MR of the older, yolk-independent hatchlings was lower overall than yolk-dependent hatchlings but correlated positively with growth rates and prior developmental rate (e.g. negatively correlated with time to hatching). Unlike another turtle species (snapping turtles), in which maternally-related differences in offspring MR were retained after yolk depletion, the maternal influence on offspring MR in diamondback terrapins is limited to early hatchling development and growth. The transient nature of the maternal effect, which was present only during the period that hatchlings were metabolizing yolk, suggests that variation among females in the composition of yolk deposited in eggs could be responsible for the differences observed in this study.  2016 Elsevier Inc."

Polymorphisms in pleiotropic cascades or genetic linkage may lead to correlations of life history traits such as immunity, parasite infection levels, pigmentation and lifetime reproductive success. The common buzzard Buteo buteo is a bird of prey occurring in several plumage morphs, which differ in pigmentation and in the prevalence, infection intensity and clone composition of their most common blood parasite, as well as in ectoparasite infestation levels. Buzzard morphs are heritable and exhibit a heterozygote advantage where intermediates have higher lifetime reproductive success (LRS). We explored the hypothesis that the differences in pigmentation also correspond to differences in immunity. We hence compared an inducible adaptive and an innate constitutive immune response between the buzzard plumage morphs. The increase of specific anti-tetanus antibodies after vaccination was explained by the morph of the nestlings mother and was highest in offspring of intermediate mothers. Additionally, nestlings with higher humoral response were less infected with blood parasites and, if infected, harboured a lower genetic diversity of these parasites. The phytohaemagglutinin-induced skin swelling, a complex of cellular inflammatory responses, was lowest in intermediate nestlings. The higher LRS of intermediate buzzards suggests that the cellular immunity is an inferior fitness determinant compared to humoral immunity. The strength of immune responses was not linear along the melanisation gradient, indicating that there is most likely no simple genetic correlation between immune responses and plumage morphs.  2016, The Author(s)."

These male-derived benefits can be due to material and/or genetic effects. The latter include an increase in the attractiveness, hence likely mating success, of sons. Females can potentially enhance any sex-biased benefits of mating with certain males by adjusting the offspring sex ratio depending on their mate's phenotype. One hypothesis is that females should produce mainly sons when mating with more attractive or higher quality males. Here we perform a meta-analysis of the empirical literature that has accumulated to test this hypothesis. The mean effect size was small (r = 0.0640.095; i.e. explaining <1% of variation in offspring sex ratios) but statistically significant in the predicted direction. It was, however, not robust to correction for an apparent publication bias towards significantly positive results. We also examined the strength of the relationship using different indices of male attractiveness/quality that have been invoked by researchers (ornaments, behavioural displays, female preference scores, body condition, male age, body size, and whether a male is a within-pair or extra-pair mate). Only ornamentation and body size significantly predicted the proportion of sons produced. We obtained similar results regardless of whether we ran a standard random-effects meta-analysis, or a multi-level, Bayesian model that included a correction for phylogenetic non-independence. A moderate proportion of the variance in effect sizes (51.656.2%) was due to variation that was not attributable to sampling error (i.e. sample size). Much of this non-sampling error variance was not attributable to phylogenetic effects or high repeatability of effect sizes among species. It was approximately equally attributable to differences (occurring for unknown reasons) in effect sizes among and within studies (25.3, 22.9% of the total variance). There were no significant effects of year of publication or two aspects of study design (experimental/observational or field/laboratory) on reported effect sizes. We discuss various practical reasons and theoretical arguments as to why small effect sizes should be expected, and why there might be relatively high variation among studies. Currently, there are no species where replicated, experimental studies show that mothers adjust the offspring sex ratio in response to a generally preferred male phenotype. Ultimately, we need more experimental studies that test directly whether females produce more sons when mated to relatively more attractive males, and that provide the requisite evidence that their sons have higher mean fitness than their daughters.  2015 Cambridge Philosophical Society"

In many species, badge sizes have been shown to correlate with dominance rank, which may be mediated by testosterone (T) levels. Here, we explored geographic variation in the size and properties of the white wing patch of female pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca and its relation to circulating T levels in three populations (two southern populations in central Spain and a northern population in Finland). Furthermore, we aimed at detecting if the size of the white wing patch and its ultraviolet (UV) reflectance indicate individual quality. We found that females in Spain had larger, brighter and more UV reflecting wing patches than those in Finland. Females with higher UV reflectance and larger primary white patches bred earlier. Younger females and females with larger primary white wing patches showed higher T levels. In contrast, higher values of UV reflectance in feathers from these patches were associated with low T levels. Despite genetic differentiation and differences in trait expression between populations, female pied flycatchers from different populations may converge and use the size of white wing patches to signal their T levels and thereby their social dominance.  2016 The Authors"

To aid disease detection during the period of captivity, Gough buntings (n=25; five adult females, 15 adult males and five juveniles) were captured, measured and sampled to determine reference ranges for routine haematological and biochemical parameters and to identify any faecal bacterial species and intestinal and haemoparasites. Adult females had significantly higher blood glucose (P=0.02 and 0.05 for different analyzers) and globulins (P=0.02) than adult males or juveniles, and juveniles had consistently higher, although not significant, concentrations of creatine kinase. Juveniles had significantly (P=0.007) more heterophils than adults; eosinophils were rare in adults and absent in juveniles and azurophils were absent from all individuals sampled. No parasite eggs were found in the faeces and no haemoparasites were found in blood smears.

No overt clinical or subclinical disease was found in any of the birds examined, which suggests they are suitable for short-term captivity during ecosystem restoration and the data will provide key haematological and biochemical reference ranges for monitoring their health.

Yet, the relative roles of these evolutionary processes remain unidentified, because little is known about the genetic correlation that might exist between the ornaments of both sexes, and few estimates of sex-specific autosomal or sex-linked genetic variances are available. In this study, we used two wild blue tit populations with 9 years of measurements on two colour ornaments: One structurally based (blue crown) and one carotenoid based (yellow chest). We found significant autosomal heritability for the chromatic part of the structurally based colouration in both sexes, whereas carotenoid chroma was heritable only in males, and the achromatic part of both colour patches was mostly non heritable. Power limitations, which are probably common among most data sets collected so far in wild populations, prevented estimation of sex-linked genetic variance. Bivariate analyses revealed very strong cross-sex genetic correlations in all heritable traits, although the strength of these correlations was not related to the level of sexual dimorphism. In total, our results suggest that males and females share a majority of their genetic variation underlying colour ornamentation, and hence the evolution of these sex-specific traits may depend greatly on correlated responses to selection in the opposite sex.  2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature."

Cortisol was microinjected into the yolk at one cell-stage, to mimic maternal transfer, and the larvae [96 hours post-fertilization (hpf)] displayed increased activity in light and a reduction in thigmotaxis, a behavioural model for anxiety, suggesting an increased propensity for boldness. This cortisol-mediated behavioural phenotype corresponded with an increase in primary neurogenesis, as measured by incorporation of EdU at 24 hpf, in a region-specific manner in the preoptic region and the pallium, the teleostean homolog of the hippocampus. Also, cortisol increased the expression of the proneural gene neurod4, a marker of neurogenesis, in a region- and development-specific manner in the embryos. Altogether, excess zygotic cortisol, mimicking maternal stress, affects early brain development and behavioural phenotype in larval zebrafish. We propose a key role for cortisol in altering brain development leading to enhanced boldness, which may be beneficial in preparing the offspring to a stressful environment and enhancing fitness.

In this study, to investigate whether early hypoxia alters the developmental trajectory of the stress response, zebrafish embryos were exposed to 4 h of anoxia at 36 h post-fertilization and reared to adults when the responses to secondary stressors were assessed. While embryonic anoxia did not affect basal cortisol levels or the cortisol response to hypoxia in later life, it had a marked effect on the responses to a social stressor. In dyadic social interactions, adults derived from embryonic anoxia initiated more chases, bit more often, entered fewer freezes and had lower cortisol levels. Adults derived from embryonic anoxia also performed more bites towards their mirror image, had lower gonadal aromatase gene expression and had higher testosterone levels. We conclude that acute embryonic anoxia has long-lasting consequences for the hormonal and behavioural responses to social interactions in zebrafish. Specifically, we demonstrate that acute embryonic anoxia favours the development of a dominant and aggressive phenotype, and that a disruption in sex steroid production may contribute to the programming effects of environmental hypoxia.  2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

In oviparous taxa such as fish, maternally derived glucocorticoids in eggs are known for their capacity to shape offspring phenotype. Using a variety of methodologies, scientists have quantified maternally derived levels of egg cortisol, the primary glucocorticoid in fishes, and examined the cascading effects of egg cortisol on progeny phenotype. Here we summarize and interpret the current state of knowledge on egg cortisol in fishes and the relationships linking maternal stress/state to egg cortisol and offspring phenotype/fitness. Considerable variation in levels of egg cortisol exists across species and among females within a species; this variation is hypothesized to be due to interspecific differences in reproductive life history and intraspecific differences in female condition. Outcomes of experimental studies manipulating egg cortisol vary both inter- and intraspecifically. Moreover, while exogenous elevation of egg cortisol (as a proxy for maternal stress) induces phenotypic changes commonly considered to be maladaptive (e.g., smaller offspring size), emerging work in other taxa suggests that there can be positive effects on fitness when the offsprings environment is taken into account. Investigations into (i) mechanisms by which egg cortisol elicits phenotypic change in offspring (e.g., epigenetics), (ii) maternal and offspring buffering capacity of cortisol, and (iii) factors driving natural variation in egg cortisol and how this variation affects offspring phenotype and fitness are all germane to discussions on egg glucocorticoids as signals of maternal stress.  2016 by The University of Chicago.

However, prenatal maternal factors, like yolk testosterone, may also facilitate parent-offspring coadaptation via their effects on offspring begging and development. In fact, maternal effects are thought to adjust offspring phenotype to the environmental conditions they will experience after birth, which are in turn strongly dependent on the levels of parental provisioning. Using cross-fostering experiments in canaries, we tested the role of maternal effects on parent-offspring coadaptation from two different approaches. First, we analyzed whether females deposit yolk testosterone in relation to their own or their partner's prospective parental provisioning, measured as the rate of parental feeding to foster nestlings. Second, we investigated whether females deposit yolk testosterone in relation to costs they incurred when raising a previous brood, as this likely impinges on their capacity to provide parental care in the near future. However, from the results of both experiments we have no evidence that canary females deposit yolk testosterone in order to match offspring begging to the levels of care they and/or their partners provide. We therefore found no evidence that yolk testosterone facilitates parent-offspring coadaptation. In addition, our results suggest that the functional consequences of yolk testosterone deposition may relate to hatching asynchrony since it primarily varied with egg laying order.  2016 Elsevier Inc."

Accumulation of maternal sexual steroids in yolk influences behavior, growth, morphology, immune function and viability of descendants (T. Groothuis et al., 2005). Testosterone and androstenedione cause changes in postnatal growth (H. Schwabl, 1996), immunocompetence (M.Tobler et al., 2010), models of competitive and agonistic behavior in non-reproductive relationships between individuals (Mller W. et al., 2009) and sexual intercourse (C .Eising et al., 2006). Such consequences develop as a result of regulation of corresponding functions in the descendant body, including indirect influence through other systems. Stress simulation in females by administration of corticosterone (K) led to a dose dependent change in growth and development in the chicken. Imbalance in fatty acids' ratio and assimilation in descendant embryo occurred in the yolk (S. Yalin et al., 2011) reduce fertility and shell quality, and embryo mortality and death of chicks increase (M. Eriksen et al., 2003; Saino N. et al., 2005; Y.-H. Kim et al., 2014). Similar effects were found in the offspring of hens lines divergently selected by growth rate (A. Abdelkareem et al., 2013). In the yolk of white shell eggs of unstressed layers the corticosterone level is almost two times higher than that in brown shell eggs (K. Navara et al., 2010). Under the influence of different stress factors the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis alters, resulting in an inadequate kinetics of sex hormones and inhibition of the reproductive function. Increased concentration of blood corticosterone in the mother hens is accompanied by changes in the content of gonadal hormones in the egg yolk (A. Janczak et al., 2009; F. Guibert et al., 2013), productivity (A. Bertin et al., 2008; E. de Haas et al., 2013) and the sex ratio (S. Correa et al., 2005; T. Pike et al., 2005; S. Pryke et al., 2011). Migration of the hormones form a mother hen to the egg and the embryo, and their interference in metabolism regulation in the descendant occur during early ontogenesis, when the functions of organs and systems are the most labile. Changes in ontogenesis caused by accumulated maternal hormones can be regarded as an adaptive response in the descendants to be ready to a shift in environmental conditions (T. Mousseau et al., 1998; Z. Kankova et al., 2012). Due to egg-deposited maternal hormones the offspring can form phenotypic traits which are inherited epigenetically (T. Groothuis et al., 2008; D. Ho et al., 2011). All these finding should be taken into account at poultry commercial reproduction. When using technological methods and veterinary measures, it is necessary to appreciate possibility of transovarial transfer of signal information about outer conditions mediated by the maternal hormones to cause adaptations in the descendants.  1997.

As maternal TH levels are known to be essential to embryonic development, the natural variation of maternal THs probably represents a pathway of maternal effects that can modify offspring phenotype. However, potential fitness consequences of variation of maternal TH exposure within the normal physiological range and without confounding effects of the mother have never been experimentally investigated. We experimentally manipulated the levels of yolk T3 and T4 within the physiological range in a species in which the embryo develops outside the mother's body, the Rock Pigeon (Columba livia) eggs. Making use of the natural difference of yolk testosterone between the two eggs of pigeon clutches, we were also able to investigate the potential interaction between THs and testosterone. Elevated yolk TH levels enhanced embryonic development and hatching success, and reduced body mass but not tarsus length between day 14 and fledging. The yolk hormones increased plasma T4 concentrations in females but reduced it in males, in line with the effect on metabolic rate at hatching. Plasma concentrations of T3 and testosterone were not significantly affected. The effects of treatment did not differ between eggs with high or low testosterone levels. Our data indicate that natural variation in maternal yolk TH levels affects offspring phenotype and embryonic survival, potentially influencing maternal and chick fitness.  2016 Elsevier Inc."

These steroids can affect several aspects of embryo development, often resulting in increases in overall size or the speed of growth of different traits. However, several studies suggest that they also entail immune costs to the offspring. In this study, we explored whether variation in yolk androgen concentration affected several measures of the constitutive and cell-mediated immune axes in the spotless starling (Sturnus unicolor). Using a within-brood design, we injected different doses of androgens (testosterone and androstenedione) into the eggs. Our study showed that experimentally increased yolk androgens led to sex-specific immunosuppression in both the innate and adaptive axes of the immune system. Both cell-mediated immune response (CMI) and lysozyme activity decreased with increasing androgen levels injected into the egg in the case of male nestlings, whereas there were no effects on females. The effects that we found were always linear: no quadratic or threshold patterns were detected. We found no effects of the experimental treatment in hemolysis or agglutination capacity, but these measures were negatively correlated with CMI, suggesting negative correlation among different branches of the immune system. Blood (trypanosomes and hemosporidians) and intestinal (coccidia) parasites were not affected by the experimental increase of yolk androgen levels. Our results show that in our study species yolk androgens induce immunosuppression in some axes of the male nestling immune system. Further studies should analyze the proximate causes for these contrasting effects in different axes of the immune system and the reason for the differential impact on males and females.  2016 by The University of Chicago.

One possibility suggested regarding female post-mating strategies is differential allocation into offspring investment. Female birds produce not only the largest, but also most colourful eggs of all oviparous taxa. Larger eggs provide space for bigger embryos, or more nutrition for their development, but the question why eggs are more colourful and why there is variation in eggshell colouration remains. In this context, the focus of interest has been to explain inter-clutch variation but in many bird species, eggshell colouration also varies within a clutch. Surprisingly, less attention has been paid to this phenomenon. Therefore, we propose the ''female egg recognition'' hypothesis, suggesting that mothers use colour characteristics to interpret egg attributes and allocate further investment into each egg accordingly. To evaluate the feasibility of the hypothesis, we tested several underlying predictions and examined their suitability using a dataset from our tree sparrow (Passer montanus) study. We predict (i) substantial within-clutch variation in eggshell colouration which, (ii) should be related to laying sequence, (iii) reflect egg quality and, (iv) should stimulate a female response. Methods. Eggshell coloration data were obtained via digital photography under standardized conditions, taken after clutch completion. Lightness (L*), representing the achromatic properties of an egg has been chosen as the most important predictor in dark cavities and was related to egg quality and position in the nest. Results. In our tree sparrows, first and mainly last eggs were less pigmented, providing information about laying order. Egg volume, which predicts chick quality, positively correlates with eggshell coloration. Finally, we could show that female tree sparrows placed darker, but not bigger, eggs into more central incubation positions. Discussion. All basic prerequisites for the ''female egg recognition'' hypothesis are fulfilled. In this context practicability and feasibility of the hypothesis and alternative explanations are discussed. However future work is necessary to determine a direct effect on offspring condition.  2017 Polek et al."

Such lasting effects of developmental plasticity impactDarwinian fitness and should be subject to selection. Nevertheless, the adaptive value of developmental plasticity is still subject to ongoing debate. One key problem hampering the understanding of developmental plasticity is that its mechanisms and function are mostly studied in simple laboratory environments testing for the effects of only a single environmental factor during a single ontogenetic period. However, most natural environments are multidimensional and complex and environmental influences affect development at multiple ontogenetic stages. In the past years, a number of theoretical and experimental studies emerged, which address effects of more natural levels of environmental complexity. After a general introduction into theoretical and experimental approaches to the study of developmental plasticity, I review the main theoretical insights from these models and contrast them with experimental results obtained from long-lived vertebrates, to illustrate how incorporating natural levels of complexity can improve our understanding of phenotypic development. The review centers around two main questions: (1) When should environmental information influencing development be obtainedand when is this information beneficial? (2) How is information obtained during multiple life stages or from multiple environmental parameters integrated during phenotypic development? Theoretical results about the temporal patterns of the use of environmental information and the integration of cues from different sources emphasize the importance of environmental predictability, reliability, and the value of information. The experimental evidence illustrates the necessity to evaluate fitness across the entire life of long-lived species, if we aim to test predictions from evolutionary models. Moreover, it suggests that we need models incorporating more of the complexities of real life, such as interactive effects of environmental components, or a deviation from simplistic assumptions about the temporal pattern of environmental predictability.  2017 Elsevier Inc."

We examined the potential role of elevated yolk testosterone in eggs of the principal brood parasite in North America, the brown-headed cowbird, and three of its frequent host species. Elevated maternal androgens in eggs are a common maternal effect observed in many avian species when breeding conditions are unfavorable. These steroids accelerate embryo development, shorten incubation period, increase nestling growth rate, and enhance begging vigor, all traits that can increase the survival of offspring. We hypothesized that elevated maternal androgens in host eggs are a defense against brood parasitism. Our second hypothesis was that elevated maternal androgens in cowbird eggs are a defense against intra-specific competition. For host species, we found that elevated yolk testosterone was correlated with parasitized nests of small species, those whose nest success is most reduced by cowbird parasitism. For cowbirds, we found that elevated yolk testosterone was correlated with eggs in multiply-parasitized nests, which indicate intra-specific competition for nests due to high cowbird density. We propose experimental work to further examine the use of maternal effects by cowbirds and their hosts.  2016"

Begging is thought to be a reflection of offspring need, but short-term fluctuations in begging do not necessarily provide reliable information. Parents thus have to adjust their provisioning behaviour to the changing demands of their offspring, while minimizing the costs of responding to unreliable information. We conducted two experiments with blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, in which we tested how parents respond to short-term and long-term changes in begging intensity. In the first experiment we investigated how parents respond to increased begging during a single nest visit. In the second experiment we investigated how parents respond to increased begging during every nest visit for 1h. Parents did not return faster to the nest during the short-term manipulation. Contrary to our expectations, however, parents also did not return faster to the nest in response to long-term manipulation. Instead, parents spent more time in the nestbox during both the short-term and the long-term manipulation. Our results highlight that the general pattern of a positive parental response to increased begging may not be a universal one. Comparisons across species and populations may help reveal the factors underlying variation in parental responsiveness to begging.  2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour"

Most previous studies have exposed individuals to different conditions throughout development until nutritional independence. Yet under natural conditions, individuals may experience limitations for much shorter periods due to transient environmental fluctuations. Here, we used zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) in captivity to determine if conditions experienced during distinctly different early developmental phases contribute differently to male and female attractiveness and subsequent reproduction. We conducted a breeding experiment in which offspring were exposed to food regimes with (a) low quality food provided only during the nestling period, (b) low quality food provided only during the fledgling period, or (c) high quality food throughout early development. We show that despite short-term effects on biometry and physiology, there were no effects on either male or female attractiveness, as tested in two-way mate choice free-flight aviary experiments. In a subsequent breeding experiment, the offspring from the initial experiment were allowed to breed themselves. The next generation offspring from mothers raised under lower quality nutrition as either nestling or fledging were lighter at hatching compared to offspring from mothers raised under higher quality nutrition whereas paternal early nutrition had no such effects. The lack of early developmental limitations on attractiveness suggests that attractiveness traits were not affected or that birds compensated for any such effects. Furthermore, maternal trans-generational effects of dietary restrictions emphasize the importance of role of limited periods of early developmental stress in the expression of environmentally determined fitness components.  2017 Honarmand et al."

The number of birds on perches at midnight were recorded 7 times during production. Prevalence of keel bone fractures, breast blisters, pododermatitis, and plumage quality of hens was assessed at 45 wk, and production was monitored daily. To determine subsequent effects on offspring, chicks from hens with and without perches were reared and their growth rate was assessed. Analysis found more broiler breeders perched at night when 14 cm perch length per bird was provided than with less available perch length (P = 0.0005), but there was no difference between 14 and 20 cm per bird. Perch use declined with age from about 50 to 20% (P < 0.0001). The number of eggs and hatchability were not affected by treatment. During a period of high temperatures, mortality was lower in pens with perches (P = 0.001). Keel bone fractures were present in 1/4 of hens and were not affected by the presence of perches. The growth of chicks was not affected by the parent treatment.

Previous studies have demonstrated the effects of divorce and pair disruption on immediate reproductive success. Here, we used a paired experimental design in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) to examine the hormonal mechanisms that modulate parental behavior and reproductive success in response to a partnership change (hereafter divorce). Specifically, we examined the effects of divorce on the avian stress hormone corticosterone (CORT) in both parents and nestlings, parental behaviors (incubation and nestling provisioning), prolactin (PRL), and reproductive success. We found that divorce resulted in delayed clutch initiation, reduced clutch mass, and an increase in nestling CORT response to a standardized stressor. These effects on reproductive investment and chick CORT response were not clearly determined by parental endocrine responses. Divorce had no effect on the level of parental CORT. PRL levels were highly correlated within a pair regardless of treatment, were negatively related to the investment that males made in incubation, and increased in experimental males as a result of pair disruption. This study demonstrates the fundamental impact which divorce has not only on reproduction, but also the physiological stress responses of offspring and suggests that in socially monogamous animals the maintenance of a stable partnership over time could be advantageous for long term fitness.  2016 Elsevier Inc."

We here report for the first time the temporal changes in OHC and an index of vitellogenin concentrations in female plasma from the pre-laying period to clutch completion in free-living birds: the southern rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome) breeding in the Falkland/Malvinas Islands. In addition, OHC concentrations in the corresponding clutches were analysed. OHC concentrations in female plasma and in the yolk of both the first (A-) and the second (B-)eggs followed a similar pattern, with hexachlorobenzene (HCB) > polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) > dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) > methoxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (MeO-PBDEs) > chlordanes (CHLs) > polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)  hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs). The higher concentrations of MeO-PBDEs compared to PBDEs indicate a diet containing naturally-produced MeO-PBDEs. All OHC compounds except for PBDEs increased from the pre-laying period to A-egg laying and subsequently declined from A-egg laying to B-egg laying, and female plasma vitellogenin showed the same pattern. For PCBs and MeO-PBDEs, we found positive correlations between female plasma during A-egg laying and both eggs, and for HCB between female plasma and A-eggs only. During pre-laying, only MeO-PBDEs correlated between both eggs and female plasma, and no correlations between OHC concentrations in eggs and female plasma were found during B-egg laying, highlighting that maternal transfer of OHCs is time- and compound-specific. Finally, female vitellogenin concentrations did not significantly correlate with any OHC compounds in either female plasma or eggs, and our results therefore did not confirm the suggested role of vitellogenin in the maternal transfer of OHC molecules into their eggs.  2017 Elsevier Ltd"

The nearly universal influence of cell shape on orientation and positioning of spindles and cleavage furrows and the mechanisms that mediate this influence are discussed. We discuss in particular models of aster and spindle centering and orientation in large embryonic blastomeres that rely on asymmetric internal pulling forces generated by the cleavage furrow for the previous cell cycle.

Locomotion involves physical activity, which can have far-reaching effects on physiology and neurobiology, both acutely and chronically. In human populations and in laboratory rodents, higher levels of physical activity are generally associated with positive health outcomes, although excessive exercise can have adverse consequences. Whether and how such relationships occur in wild animals is unknown. Behavioral variation among individuals arises from genetic and environmental factors and their interactions as well as from developmental programming (persistent effects of early-life environment). Although tremendous progress has been made in identifying genetic and environmental influences on individual differences in behavior, early-life effects are not well understood. Early-life effects can in some cases persist across multiple generations following a single exposure and, in principle, may constrain or facilitate the rate of evolution at multiple levels of biological organization. Understanding the mechanisms of such transgenerational effects (e.g., exposure to stress hormones in utero, inherited epigenetic alterations) may prove crucial to explaining unexpected and/or sex-specific responses to selection as well as limits to adaptation. One area receiving increased attention is early-life effects on adult physical activity. Correlational data from epidemiological studies suggest that early-life nutritional stress can (adversely) affect adult human activity levels and associated physiological traits (e.g., body composition, metabolic health). The few existing studies of laboratory rodents demonstrate that both maternal and early-life exercise can affect adult levels of physical activity and related phenotypes. Going forward, rodents offer many opportunities for experimental studies of (multigenerational) early-life effects, including studies that use maternal exposures and cross-fostering designs.  2016 by The University of Chicago.

These methods include hormone measurement in amniotic fluid, saliva, urine, feces, and blood plasma or serum of fetus, mother, and umbilical cord. We also discuss hormone-mediated maternal effects, the manipulation of hormone levels in the embryo or mother, hormone treatment in persons with Gender Dysphoria, and the 2D:4D finger length ratio as a proxy for prenatal testosterone exposure. We argue that lateralization can and should be studied at different levels of organization. Namely, structural and functional brain lateralization, perception and cognition, lateralized motor output and performance. We present tests for these different levels and argue that keeping these levels apart is important, as well as realizing that lateralization and the hormonal influence on it may be different at different levels, for different functions and different species. We conclude that the study of hormonal influences on lateralization of brain and behavior has not yet exploited the knowledge and wide array of techniques currently available, leaving an interesting research field substantially under-explored.

Phenotypic engineering allows us to study the relationships and trade-offs between these factors by experimentally manipulating hormone levels and assessing the effects on phenotype and fitness at the level of the whole organism. For the past 30 years, our research group has been interested in the effects of testosterone on behavior, and the role selection has played in shaping existing hormone profiles in a songbird species, the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis). We have approached this question using phenotypic engineering in the form of subcutaneous testosterone implants, first in males, and then later in females, and we summarize our results in this chapter. In brief, in males, the net effect of experimentally elevated testosterone was decreased offspring production with social mates, and decreased survival, but higher overall fitness due to an increase in siring extra-pair offspring. In females, however, treatment with elevated testosterone strongly decreased overall reproductive success, suggesting that, while selection might favor increased testosterone in males, the negative consequences for females may be constraining the evolution of this trait, resulting in a case of sexual conflict. However, circulating levels of testosterone in unmanipulated birds are labile rather than constant, so implant studies cannot provide a complete picture regarding the potential for evolutionary response to selection on hormone-mediated phenotypes. Selection has a myriad of targets involved in both testosterone synthesis and sensitivity on which it may act; we review some recent studies in the junco that examine some of these sources of individual variability.  2017 Elsevier Inc.

The populations included nine laboratory lines established in Japan (LWC, Quv, RWN, WE, AWE, AMRP, rb-TKP, NIES-L, and W), six meat-type quail lines reimported from Western countries (JD, JW, Estonia, NIES-Br, NIES-Fr, and NIES-Hn), one commercial population in Japan, and three wild quail populations collected from three Asian areas. The phylogenetic tree of mtDNA D-loop sequences revealed two distinct haplotype groups, Dloop-Group1 and Dloop-Group2. Dloop-Group1 included a dominant haplotype representing most of the quail populations, including wild quail. Dloop-Group2 was composed of minor haplotypes found in several laboratory lines, two meat-type lines, and a few individuals in commercial and wild quail populations. Taking the breeding histories of domestic populations into consideration, these results suggest that domestic quail populations may have derived from two sources, i.e., domestic populations established before and after World War II in Japan. A discriminant analysis of principal components and a Bayesian clustering analysis with microsatellite markers indicated that the domestic populations are clustered into four genetic groups. The two major groups were Microsat-Group1, which contained WE, and four WE-derived laboratory lines (LWC, Quv, RWN, and AWE), and Microsat-Group2 consisting of NIES-L, JD, JW, Estonia, NIES-Br, NIES-Fr, NIES-Hn, W, and commercial and wild populations. The remaining two lines (AMRP and rb-TKP) were each clustered into a separate clade. This hierarchical genetic difference between domestic quail populations is attributed to the genetic background derived from two different genetic sources - the pre-war and post-war populations - which is well supported by their breeding histories.  2017 Nunome et al.

Historical and modern experiments point to an initial symmetry-breaking event leading to localized Wnt and Nodal growth factor signaling and subsequent induction and formation of a self-regulating dorsal organizer. This organizer forms at the site of notochord cell internalization and expresses primarily Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) growth factor antagonists that establish a spatiotemporal gradient of BMP signaling across the embryo, directing initial cell differentiation and morphogenesis. Although the basics of this model have been known for some time, many of the molecular and cellular details have only recently been elucidated and the extent that these events remain conserved throughout vertebrate evolution remains unclear. This chapter summarizes historical perspectives as well as recent molecular and genetic advances regarding: (1) the mechanisms that regulate symmetry-breaking in the vertebrate egg and early embryo, (2) the pathways that are activated by these events, in particular the Wnt pathway, and the role of these pathways in the formation and function of the organizer, and (3) how these pathways also mediate anteroposterior patterning and axial morphogenesis.

Consequently, parental care is critical for the survival of offspring in many species, and many vertebrates have adapted this behavior to their social and ecological environments. Parental care is defined as any behavior that is performed in association with ones offspring (Rosenblatt, Mayer, Siegel. Maternal behavior among nonprimate mammals. In: Adler, Pfaff, Goy, editors. Handbook of behavioral neurobiology. New York: Plenum; 1985. p. 22998) and is well characterized in mammals and birds. In birds (class Aves), this is due to the high level of diversity across species. Parental behavior in birds protects the young from intruders, and generally involves nest building, incubation, and broody behavior which protect their young from an intruder, and the offspring are reared to independence. Broodiness is complexly regulated by the central nervous system and is associated with multiple hormones and neurotransmitters produced by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. The mechanism of this behavior has been extensively characterized in domestic chicken (Gallus domesticus), turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), and pigeons and doves (family Columbidae).

The vertebrate egg coat is composed of two to six zona pellucida (ZP) glycoproteins that are characterized by the evolutionarily conserved ZP-domain module and classified into six subfamilies based on phylogenetic analyses. Interestingly, investigations of biochemical and functional features of the ZP glycoproteins show that the roles of each ZP-glycoprotein family member in the egg-coat formation and the eggsperm interactions seemingly vary across vertebrates. This might be one reason why comprehensive understandings of the molecular basis of either architecture or physiological functions of egg coat still remain elusive despite more than 3 decades of intensive investigations. In this chapter, an overview of avian egg focusing on the oogenesis are provided in the first section, and unique features of avian egg coat, i.e., perivitelline layer, including the morphology, biogenesis pathway, and physiological functions are discussed mainly on chicken and quail in terms of the characteristics of ZP glycoproteins in the following sections. In addition, these features of avian egg coat are compared to mammalian zona pellucida, from the viewpoint that the structural and functional varieties of ZP glycoproteins might be associated with the evolutionary adaptation to their reproductive strategies. By comparing the egg coat of birds and mammals whose reproductive strategies are largely different, new insights into the molecular mechanisms of vertebrate eggsperm interactions might be provided.  2017, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

Animal growth is often constrained by unfavourable conditions and divergences from optimal body size can be detrimental to an individual's fitness, particularly in species with determinate growth and a narrow time-frame for life-time reproduction. Growth restriction in early juvenile stages can later be compensated by means of plastic developmental responses, such as adaptive catch-up growth (the compensation of growth deficits through delayed development). Although sex differences regarding the mode and degree of growth compensation have been coherently predicted from sex-specific fitness payoffs, inconsistent results imply a need for further research. We used the African Nephila senegalensis, representing an extreme case of femalebiased sexual size dimorphism (SSD), to study fitness implications of sex-specific growth compensation. We predicted effective catch-up growth in early food-restricted females to result in full compensation of growth deficits and a life-time fecundity (LTF) equivalent to unrestricted females. Based on a stronger trade-off between size-related benefits and costs of a delayed maturation, we expected less effective catch-up growth in males. Methods.Wetracked the development of over one thousand spiders in different feeding treatments, e.g., comprising a fixed period of early low feeding conditions followed by unrestricted feeding conditions, permanent unrestricted feeding conditions, or permanent low feeding conditions as a control. In a second experimental section, we assessed female fitness by measuring LTF in a subset of females. In addition, we tested whether compensatory development affected the reproductive lifespan in both sexes and analysed genotype-by-treatment interactions as a potential cause of variation in life-history traits. Results. Both sexes delayed maturation to counteract early growth restriction, but only females achieved full compensation of adult body size. Female catch-up growth resulted in equivalent LTF compared to unrestricted females. We found significant interactions between experimental treatments and sex as well as between treatments and family lineage, suggesting that family-specific responses contribute to the unusually large variation of life-history traits in Nephila spiders. Our feeding treatments had no effect on the reproductive lifespan in either sex. Discussion. Our findings are in line with predictions of life-history theory and corroborate strong fecundity selection to result in full female growth compensation. Males showed incomplete growth compensation despite a delayed development, indicating relaxed selection on large size and a stronger trade-off between late maturation and sizerelated benefits. We suggest that moderate catch-up growth in males is still adaptive as How to cite this article Neumann et al.

While negative phenotypic effects (i.e., smaller size, slower growth) are often reported, recent research coupling phenotype with other fitness-related traits has suggested positive impacts of prenatal stress. Using captive Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), we treated eggs with biologically relevant cortisol levelslow (300 ng mL1), high (1,000 ng mL1), or control (0 ng mL1)to examine the early-life impacts of maternally transferred stress hormones on offspring. Specifically, we measured early survival, rate of development, and multiple measures of morphology. Low and high cortisol dosing of eggs resulted in significantly higher survival compared to controls (37% and 24% higher, respectively). Fish reared from high dose eggs were structurally smaller compared to control fish, but despite this variation in structural size, exposure to elevated cortisol did not impact developmental rate. These results demonstrate that elevations in egg cortisol can positively influence offspring fitness through an increase in early survival while also altering phenotype at a critical life-history stage. Overall, these results suggest that exposure to prenatal stress may not always produce apparently negative impacts on offspring fitness and further proposes that complex phenotypic responses should be examined in relevant environmental conditions.  2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

In accord with current paradigms of vertebrate sex determination, temperature is believed to exert its effects on sexual development in T. scripta entirely within the middle third of development, when the gonad is forming. However, whether temperature regulates the transcriptome in T. scripta early embryos in a manner that could influence secondary sex characteristics or establish a pro-male or pro-female environment has not been investigated. In addition, apart from a handful of candidate genes, very little is known about potential similarities between the expression cascade during TSD and the genetic cascade that drives mammalian sex determination. Here, we conducted an unbiased transcriptome-wide analysis of the effects of male- and female-promoting temperatures on the turtle embryo prior to gonad formation, and on the gonad during the temperature sensitive period. We found sexually dimorphic expression reflecting differences in steroidogenic enzymes and brain development prior to gonad formation. Within the gonad, we mapped a cascade of differential expression similar to the genetic cascade established in mammals. Using a Hidden Markov Model based clustering approach, we identified groups of genes that show heterochronic shifts between M. musculus and T. scripta. We propose a model in which multiple factors influenced by temperature accumulate during early gonadogenesis, and converge on the antagonistic regulation of aromatase to canalize sex determination near the end of the temperature sensitive window of development.  2016 Elsevier Inc."

Here, we investigated whether brown trout Salmo trutta adjust their behavior in relation to energetic status and body size during a major early-life selection bottleneck, when fast growth is important. Over two consecutive time periods (P1 and P2; 12 and 23days, respectively), food availability was manipulated, using four different combinations of high (H) and low (L) rations (i.e., HH, HL, LH, and LL; first and second letter denoting ration during P1 and P2, respectively). Social effects were excluded through individual isolation. Following the treatment periods, fish in the HL treatment were on average 1521% more active than the other groups in a forced open-field test, but large within-treatment variation provided only weak statistical support for this effect. Furthermore, fish on L-ration during P2 tended to be more actively aggressive towards their mirror image than fish on H-ration. Body size was related to behavioral expression, with larger fish being more active and aggressive. Swimming activity and active aggression were positively correlated, forming a behavioral syndrome in the studied population. Based on these behavioral traits, we could also distinguish two behavioral clusters: one consisting of more active and aggressive individuals and the other consisting of less active and aggressive individuals. This indicates that brown trout fry adopt distinct behavioral strategies early in life. Significance statement: This paper provides information on the state-dependence of behavior in animals, in particular young brown trout. On the one hand, our data suggest a weak energetic state feedback where activity and aggression is increased as a response to short term food restriction. This suggests a limited scope for behavioral alterations in the face of starvation. On the other hand, body size is linked to higher activity and aggression, likely as a positive feedback between size and dominance. The experiment was carried out during the main population survival bottleneck, and the results indicate that growth is important during this stage, as 1) behavioral compensation to increase growth is limited, and 2) growth likely increases the competitive ability. However, our data also suggests that the population separates into two clusters, based on combined scores of activity and aggression (which are positively linked within individuals). Thus, apart from an active and aggressive strategy, there seems to be another more passive behavioral strategy.  2016, The Author(s)."

We show that female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) exposed to embryonic CORT produce daughters that have equal reproductive success (clutch sizes, fertility, hatching success) compared with the daughters produced from untreated mothers, but their offspring had accelerated post-hatching growth rates and were significantly heavier by nutritional independence. Although there was no significant effect on primary offspring sex ratio, females from CORT-treated mothers produced significantly female-biased clutches by nutritional independence.

Nevertheless, not all species show a positive relationship between competitive interactions and yolk testosterone, and an explanation for this interspecific variation is lacking. We here test if the magnitude and direction of maternal testosterone allocated to eggs in response to competition can be explained by life-history traits while accounting for phylogenetic relationships. We performed a meta-analysis relating effect size of yolk testosterone response to competition with species coloniality, nest type, parental effort and mating type. We found that effect size was moderated by coloniality and nest type; colonial species and those with open nests allocate less testosterone to eggs when in more competitive environments. Applying a lifehistory perspective helps contextualize studies showing little or negative responses of yolk testosterone to competition and improves our understanding of how variation in this maternal effect may have evolved.  2016 The Authors."

An artificial size hierarchy was created to provoke within-nest competition, manipulating postnatal conditions. To this end, inbred birds were weight-matched with outbred birds into duos, and each nest contained one duo of size-advantaged, and one duo of size-disadvantaged inbred and outbred nestlings. Prenatal (maternal) effects were taken into account also, enabling us to study the separate as well as the interactive effects of inbreeding, pre- and postnatal conditions on nestling development. We find that postnatal conditions were the most important determinant of early growth, with size-advantaged nestlings growing faster and obtaining larger size/body mass at fledging in comparison with size-disadvantaged nestlings. Prenatal conditions were important too, with birds that hatched from eggs that were laid late in the laying order obtaining a larger size at fledging than those hatched from early laid eggs. Inbreeding inhibited growth, but surprisingly this did not depend on (dis)advantageous pre- or postnatal conditions. Our findings imply that inbred individuals lose when they are in direct competition with same-sized outbred individuals regardless of the rearing conditions, and we thus propose that reduced competitiveness is one of the driving forces of inbreeding depression.  2016 The Authors.

We compared resource-based maternal effects, reproductive performance, and offspring quality in a model migratory passerine bird, the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris). We assessed female condition, quantity of egg constituents, quality of diet consumed during egg formation, and nestling growth and survival in two habitats: cultivated farmland and meadows. Egg, albumin, and shell mass were greater at the meadow site, while yolk mass did not differ significantly between sites; albumin mass most strongly predicted egg mass. Stable isotope enrichment (15N and 13C) in yolk but not albumin suggests a broader range of diet for yolk formation at the meadow site but could also reflect different hydric conditions between sites. 13C and 15N enrichment did not predict yolk, albumin, or egg mass. Concentration of yolk testosterone was higher at the meadow site and correlated with 13C enrichment in yolk. Nestling survival was higher in the meadow than in the farmland site and corresponded to egg mass and 13C enrichment in lipid-free yolk. Surviving nestlings were larger in the meadow than in the farmland site. Results indicate that agricultural practice influences reproductive output through resource-based maternal effects.

Changes in telomere length (dynamics) are related to fitness or life expectancy, and telomere dynamics during the development phase are likely to be affected by growth and stress factors. Here, we examined telomere dynamics of black-tailed gull chicks (Larus crassirostris) in nests with and without siblings. We found that the initial telomere lengths of singletons at hatching were longer than those of siblings, indicating that singletons are higher-quality chicks than siblings in terms of telomere length. Other factors likely affecting individual quality (i.e., sex, laying date, laying order of eggs, and clutch size) were not related to telomere lengths. Within broods, initial telomere lengths were longer in older chicks than in younger chicks, suggesting that maternal effects, which vary with laying sequence, influence the initial lengths. Additionally, telomeres of chicks with a sibling showed more attrition between hatching and fledging than those of singleton chicks, suggesting that being raised with siblings can cause a sustained competitive environment that leads to telomere loss. High growth rates were associated with a low degree of telomere shortening observed in older siblings, perhaps because slower growth reflects higher food stress and/or higher aerobic metabolism from increased begging effort. Our results show that developmental telomere attrition was an inevitable consequence in two-chick nests in the pre- and post-hatching microenvironments due to the combination of social stress within the nest and maternal effects. The results of our study shed light on telomere dynamics in early life, which may represent an important physiological undercurrent of life-history traits.  2016 Mizutani et al.

However, an increasing number of studies are disclosing the role of olfaction in the interaction of birds with their social environment and with other species, as well as in other behaviors such as nest recognition, food location and navigation. Olfaction has also been suggested to play a role in parent-offspring communication not only in the post-but also in the pre-hatching period. Volatile compounds produced during embryogenesis and passively released through the eggshell pores may indeed represent the only cue at parents' disposal to assess offspring quality, including the sex composition of their clutch before hatching. In turn, sex identification before hatching may mediate adaptive strategies of allocation to either sex. In the present study, we analyzed odour composition of barn swallow eggs incubated in their nest in order to identify any sex-related differences in volatile compounds emitted. For the first time in any bird species, we also investigated whether odour composition is associated with relatedness. The evidence of differences in odour composition among eggs containing embryos of either sex indicates that parents have a cue to identify their brood sex composition even before hatching which can be used to modulate their behavior accordingly. Moreover, odour similarity within nests may represent the prerequisite for kin recognition in this species.  2016 Costanzo et al.

The extreme egg-size dimorphism (ESD) of Eudyptes penguins, where the first-laid A-egg is approximately 18-57% smaller than the second-laid B-egg, has interested researchers for decades. Recent studies have linked variation in this trait to a carryover effect of migration that limits the physiology of yolk production and egg sizes. We assembled data on ESD and estimates of migration-reproduction overlap in penguin species and use phylogenetic methods to test the idea that migration-reproduction overlap explains variation in ESD.We showthat migration overlap is generally restricted to Eudyptes relative to non-Eudyptes penguins, and that this overlap (defined as the amount of time that egg production occurs on land versus at sea during homeward migration) is significantly and positively correlated with the degree of ESD in Eudyptes. In the non-Eudyptes species, however, ESD was unrelated to migration overlap as these species mostly produce their clutches on land. Our results support the recent hypothesis that extreme ESD of Eudyptes penguins evolved, in part, as a response to selection for a pelagic overwinter migration behaviour. This resulted in a temporal overlap with, and thus a constraint on, the physiology of follicle development, leading to smaller A-egg size and greater ESD.  2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Elevated egg cortisol levels modify offspring traits but whether maternal oxidative stress correlates with circulating and egg cortisol levels, and whether maternal/egg cortisol levels correlate with offspring oxidative stress have yet to be determined. The objective of this study was to examine the relationships among maternal and egg cortisol, and maternal and offspring oxidative stress to provide insight into the potential intergenerational effects of stressor exposure in sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Antioxidant concentration and oxidative stress were measured in maternal tissues (plasma, brain, heart and liver) as well as offspring developmental stages (pre-fertilization, 24h post-fertilization, eyed, and hatch), and were compared to both naturally-occurring and experimentally-elevated (via cortisol egg bath) levels of cortisol in eggs. Oxygen radical absorptive capacity of tissues from maternal sockeye salmon was measured spectrophotometrically and was not correlated with maternal or egg cortisol concentrations. Also, naturally-occurring and experimentally-elevated cortisol levels in eggs (to mimic maternal stress) did not affect oxidative stress or antioxidant capacity of the offspring. We conclude that the metrics of maternal stress examined in sockeye salmon (i.e., maternal/egg cortisol, maternal oxidative stress) are independent of each other, and that egg cortisol content does not influence offspring oxidative stress.  2016 Elsevier Inc."

Using wild populations of chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) and sockeye salmon (O. nerka), we investigated whether experimentally-elevated concentrations of cortisol in newly fertilized eggs had effects on offspring morphology and/or burst swimming capacity. Immediately following fertilization, eggs were incubated for 2h with water dosed with 0ng/mL or 1000ng/mL of cortisol. Embryos were reared to the fry life stage (complete yolk sac absorption). Morphology and burst swimming performance of fry were then assessed. Sockeye salmon fry reared from cortisol-treated eggs were smaller overall (i.e., smaller body, fins and eyes) compared to conspecifics reared from untreated eggs. In contrast, the morphology of chum salmon fry was not affected by the experimental elevation of egg cortisol. In both species, burst swimming duration was unaffected by egg cortisol treatment, while offspring reared from the cortisol-treated eggs initiated fewer bouts of burst swimming. Our results demonstrate that closely-related species can respond differently to elevations in egg cortisol, and not all offspring traits may be affected by these elevations in cortisol.

For wild-caught fish targeted for stock enhancement, logistical factors, such as the widespread practice of holding fish in captivity/confinement, also have the potential to modify offspring phenotype. Understanding how maternal captivity affects offspring, in comparison to offspring reared from fish that have matured in the wild, is an important but relatively understudied aspect of fish culture. We examined egg and offspring traits for wild-caught female sockeye salmon reared in captivity during the final stages of sexual maturation or captured on spawning groundsfollowing in-river maturation. Compared to females that matured in-river, captive females had smaller eggs and offspring in poorer body condition. These same offspring did however swim for longer durations. These results suggest that maternal captivity prior to spawning elicits intergenerational phenotypic change. Whether captivity-induced maternal effects are maladaptive/reduce offspring fitness will be dependent upon the environment in which offspring are being released into (e.g. captive or wild). Intergenerational effects of short-term captivity of wild fish may be a contributing mechanism mediating the success of fisheries supplementation programmes.  2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland."

The choosy individual can also adjust its parental investment to the sexual signals of its partner. Incubation is an important stage of avian reproduction, but the relationship between behaviour during incubation and mutual ornamentation is unclear. Studying a population of Collared Flycatchers Ficedula albicollis, we monitored the behaviour of both sexes during incubation in relation to their own and their partner's plumage traits, including plumage-level reflectance attributes and white patch sizes. There was a marginally positive relationship between male feeding rate during incubation and female incubation rate. Female but not male behavioural traits were associated with the laying date of the first egg and clutch size. The behaviour of the two sexes jointly determined the relative hatching speed of clutches and the hatching success of eggs. Females with larger white wing patches spent less time incubating eggs and left the nestbox more frequently. Males with larger white wing patches fed females less frequently, whereas males with brighter white plumage areas visited the nestbox more regularly without feeding. Females tended to leave the nest less often when mated to males with larger wing patches, and females spent less time incubating when males had more UV chromatic plumage. The behaviour of both partners during incubation therefore predicted hatching patterns and was correlated with their own and sometimes with their partner's plumage ornamentation. These results call for further studies of mutual ornamentation and reproductive effort during incubation.  2016 British Ornithologists' Union"

Here, we investigated whether environmental circumstances experienced by the reproducing female exert an influence on egg mass, yolk antioxidant (lutein and tocopherol) concentration, eggshell thickness, and the eggshell spotting patterns of Great Tits (Parus major). Our study showed that when caterpillars were less abundant, in colder weather and when breeding in an area of higher local breeding density, female Great Tits laid eggs of lower mass, suggesting that adverse environmental circumstances constrain the macronutrient investment into the eggs. However, we found no evidence that yolk antioxidant concentration and eggshell thickness were affected by environmental factors. Female Great Tits may use their endogenous stores or spend more time and energy in finding sufficient amounts of dietary antioxidants and calcium under unfavourable environmental conditions, which may have a cost effect on their own conditions. We found that birds that bred in the beginning of the season laid eggs with darker eggshell spots. Moreover, females laid more spotted eggs in colder weather and when breeding in higher density areas. Our results suggest that Great Tits deposit more of the potentially harmful pro-oxidant protoporphyrin pigment into the eggshell under unfavourable environmental conditions.  2016, Dt.

Colony-size variation is perplexing because individuals in some colony sizes have lower fitness than those in other colony sizes, yet extensive size variation persists in most populations. Natural variation in colony size has allowed us to better quantify the costs and benefits of coloniality, but what causes and maintains size variation is in general unknown. Ecological correlates of colony-size variation potentially include local availability of resources, such as food or nesting sites, and may also reflect individuals sorting among colonies (based on life-history traits, morphology, or behavioral propensities) to find the social environment to which they are best suited. Preferences for particular colony sizes are genetically based in some species. The fitness differences observed among colony sizes may reflect unmeasured tradeoffs among life-history components and also could vary temporally or spatially. Colony-size variation might be maintained by fluctuating directional or stabilizing selection that alternately favors individuals in different group sizes and leads to stasis in the colony-size distribution over the long term. Recent focus on the cues individuals use to select breeding habitat (e.g., conspecific attraction, reproductive success of others) does not satisfactorily explain variation in colony size. Costs of dispersal, reliance on imperfect information, and collective nonrandom movement can also lead to colony-size variation in the absence of fitness-based site selection. Our understanding of factors generating and maintaining variation in colony size remains in its infancy and offers many opportunities for future research with broad implications for behavioral ecology.  2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Typically, such influences result in subsequent activational malfunction, some of which are beneficial in aquaculture. For example, 17-methyltestosterone (MT), a synthetic androgen, is utilized in tilapia farming to bias sex ratio towards males because they are more profitable. A heavily male-biased hatchling sex ratio is reported from a crocodile population near one such tilapia operation in Guanacaste, Costa Rica. In this study we test the effects of MT on sexual differentiation in American alligators, which we used as a surrogate for all crocodilians. Experimentally, alligators were exposed to MT in ovo at standard ecotoxicological concentrations. Sexual differentiation was determined by examination of primary and secondary sex organs post hatching. We find that MT is capable of producing male embryos at temperatures known to produce females and demonstrate a dose-dependent gradient of masculinization. Embryonic exposure to MT results in hermaphroditic primary sex organs, delayed renal development and masculinization of the clitero-penis (CTP).  2016"

In line with this prediction, most sex-linked genes are associated with reproduction in the respective sex. In addition to traits directly involved in fertility and fecundity, mediators of maternal effects may be predisposed to evolve sex-linkage, because they indirectly affect female fitness through their effect on offspring phenotype. Here, we test for sex-linked inheritance of a key mediator of prenatal maternal effects in oviparous species, the transfer of maternally derived testosterone to the eggs. Consistent with maternal inheritance, we found that in Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) granddaughters resemble their maternal (but not their paternal) grandmother in yolk testosterone deposition. This pattern of resemblance was not due to non-genetic priming effects of testosterone exposure during prenatal development, as an experimental manipulation of yolk testosterone levels did not affect the females testosterone transfer to their own eggs later in life. Instead,Wchromosome and/or mitochondrial variation may underlie the observed matrilineal inheritance pattern. Ultimately, the inheritance of mediators of maternal effects along the maternal line will allow for a fast and direct response to female-specific selection, thereby affecting the dynamics of evolutionary processes mediated by maternal effects.  2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society."

Longer-term temperature variation could function as a cue, predicting chick rearing conditions to which yolk hormone levels are adjusted, while short-term temperature variation during egg formation may causally affect hormone transfer to eggs. We studied the effects of ambient temperature on yolk androgens (testosterone and androstenedione) and thyroid hormones (thyroxine and triiodothyronine) in great tits (Parus major) using data from unmanipulated clutches from a wild population and from aviary birds (ad libitum food) exposed to different experimental temperature treatments during five years. Both in the wild and in captivity, longer-term pre-laying ambient temperature was not associated with clutch mean yolk hormone levels, while the way androstenedione and thyroxine levels varied across the laying sequence did associate with pre-laying temperature in the wild. Yolk testosterone levels were positively correlated with short-term temperature (during yolk formation) changes within clutches in both wild and captivity. We also report, for the first time in a wild bird, that yolk thyroxine levels correlated with a key environmental factor: thyroxine levels were negatively correlated with ambient temperature during egg formation. Thus, yolk hormone levels, especially testosterone, seem to be causally affected by ambient temperature. These short-term effects might reflect physiological changes in females with changes in ambient temperature. The adaptive value of the variation with ambient temperatures pre-laying or during egg formation should be studied with hormone manipulations in different thermal environments.  2016 ."

We studied the heritability of egg components and their genetic and phenotypic covariation in great tits (Parus major), using captive-bred full siblings of wild origin. Egg mass, testosterone (T) and androstenedione (A4) hormone concentrations showed moderate heritability, in agreement with earlier findings. Interestingly, yolk triiodothyronine hormone (T3), but not its precursor, thyroxine hormone (T4), concentration was heritable. An immune factor, albumen lysozyme, showed moderate heritability, but yolk immunoglobulins (IgY) did not. The genetic correlation estimates were moderate but statistically nonsignificant; a trend for a positive genetic correlation was found between A4 and egg mass, T and lysozyme and IgY and lysozyme, respectively. Interestingly, phenotypic correlations were found only between A4 and T, and T4 and T3, respectively.

In a food supplementation experiment, females were food-supplemented prior to and during egg-laying and androgen concentrations were measured throughout the laying order. Predation risk was investigated in three different studies combining both correlative data, where flycatchers bred in close proximity to two different predator species that prey upon adult flycatchers (either Tengmalm's owl Aegolius funereus or pygmy owl Glaucidium passerinum), and an experimental manipulation, where flycatchers were exposed to cues of a nest predator (least weasel Mustela nivalis). Females receiving food supplementation laid eggs with lower concentrations of androstenedione (A4) than females not receiving food supplements. Yolk testosterone (T) concentration showed the same pattern but the difference was not statically significant. Testosterone (but not A4) concentration increased within clutches, from the first to the last egg, independently of the food supplementation. Females breeding under high predation risk did not differ from control females in their yolk androgen levels (A4, T or progesterone). However, concentrations of A4 tended to be lower in the proximity of pygmy owls, which could indirectly increase offspring survival after fledging. Food supplementation during egg-laying seems to have a stronger impact on maternal transfer of androgens than predation risk. Food availability and predation risk could differentially affect the trade-offs of androgen allocation for the offspring when raised in good vs. dangerous environments.  2016 The Authors"

The behaviour is energetically costly, and investment in incubation strategies within species, like female nest attentiveness and the feeding by the non-incubating partner during incubation, can therefore vary depending on environmental and individual characteristics. However, little is known about the combined effect of these characteristics. We investigated the importance of ambient temperature, habitat quality, and bird age on female incubation behaviour and male feeding of the incubating female (incubation feeding) in blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus, a socially monogamous songbird. An increase in ambient temperature resulted in a higher nest temperature, and this enabled females to increase the time off the nest for self-maintenance activities. Probably as a consequence of this, an increase in ambient temperature was associated with fewer incubation feedings by the male. Moreover, in areas with more food available (more deciduous trees), females had shorter incubation recesses and males fed females less often. Additionally, males fed young females more, presumably to increase such females investment in their eggs, which were colder on average (despite the length of recesses and female nest attentiveness being independent of female age). Male age did not affect incubation feeding rate. In conclusion, the patterns of incubation behaviour were related to both environmental and individual characteristics, and male incubation feeding was adjusted to females need for food according these characteristics, which can facilitate new insights to the study of avian incubation energetics. Significance statement: Parents often invest a substantial amount of energy in raising offspring. How much they do so depends on several environmental factors and on the extent they cooperate to raise the offspring. In birds, males can feed incubating females, which may allow females to stay longer on the nest, which, in turn, may ultimately improve reproductive success. The interplay between environmental factors and such incubation feeding on incubation attendance has, however, received little attention. Here, we show that favourable circumstances (higher ambient temperature and food availability) allowed incubating blue tit females to increase the time off the nest to improve self-maintenance and males to feed them less, whereas males also fed inexperienced partners more often. Thus, we show a concerted effect of several environmental and intrinsic factors on parental effort during incubation, which will help to improve the general understanding of avian incubation and parental care.  2016, The Author(s)."

After flight training, birds were paired within treatment groups for breeding. We analyzed eggs for lutein and Vitamin E concentrations and the plasma of parents throughout the experiment for non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity and oxidative damage. Exercised birds had higher oxidative damage levels than non-exercised birds after flight training, despite supplementation with dietary antioxidants. Supplementation with water-soluble antioxidants decreased the deposition of lipid-soluble antioxidants into eggs and decreased yolk size. Flight exercise also lowered deposition of lutein, but not Vitamin E, to eggs. These findings have important implications for future studies of wild birds during migration and other oxidative challenges.  2016. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd."

Although temperature is acentral feature of the environment forectotherms, its role in parental effects has been little explored until recently. Here, parental basking opportunity was manipulated in an oviparous lizard with temperature-dependent sex determination, the jacky dragon (Amphibolurus muricatus). Eggs were incubated at a temperature that typically produces a 50:50 sex ratio, and hatchlings were reared in a standard thermal environment. Offspring of parents in short bask conditions appeared to have better fitness outcomes in captive conditions than those of parents in long bask conditions - they had greater growth and survival as a function of their mass. In addition, the sex of offspring (male or female) depended on the interaction between parental treatment and egg mass, and treatment impacted whether sons or daughters grew larger in their first season. The interactive effects of treatment on offspring sex and growth are consistent with adaptive explanations for the existence of temperature-dependent sex determination in this species. Moreover, the greater performance recorded in short bask offspring may represent an anticipatory parental effect to aid offspring in predicted conditions of restricted thermal opportunity. Together, these responses constitute a crucial component of the population response to spatial or temporal variation in temperature.  2016. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd."

To date, little is known about maternal effects that are mediated by acute embryonic exposure to glucocorticoids. In birds, elevated maternal transmission of corticosterone (CORT) to egg albumen is mainly dependent on acute stress. In this study, we increased CORT levels in the egg albumen of a wild passerine, the great tit (Parus major), breeding in favourable deciduous and less suitable coniferous habitat. Subsequently we measured the somatic growth, baseline and acute glucocorticoid responses, immunity and behaviour of prenatally manipulated offspring with respect to control siblings. We found that prenatally CORT-exposed nestlings had lower baseline CORT levels, a more rapid decline in CORT during recovery from a standardized stressor, and a reduced heterophil/lymphocyte ratio compared with controls. Although stress-induced total CORT levels remained unchanged, free CORT levels were significantly lower and the levels of corticosteroid binding globulins (CBG) significantly higher in experimental offspring. Prenatally CORT-exposed offspring begged longer after hatching than controls. Stress-induced behavioural activity of fledglings did not differ between treatments, while its association with baseline CORT levels was significant in the control group only. The body mass and tarsus length of fledglings was positively affected by manipulation in unfavourable coniferous habitat only. We conclude that maternal effects related to elevated levels of albumen CORT modify diverse aspects of offspring phenotype and potentially increase offspring performance in resource poor environments. Moreover, our results indicate that maternal glucocorticoids may suppress the effect of hormones on behavioural responses.  2016 Elsevier Inc."

Avian embryos respond to photoperiod and seasonal cues during development and in this study we evaluate the influence of photoperiod and season on posthatching growth and development in Franklin's gull (Leucophaeus pipixcan). Early- and late-season chicks exposed to short and long photoperiods during development were reared under common garden conditions. Photoperiod had no effect on posthatching growth and development, but seasonal effects present in the egg (maternal egg effects or genetic) did influence posthatching growth and development. Late-season chicks grew body mass and primary flight feathers at faster rates than early-season chicks, which we hypothesize facilitates independence and readiness for migration. Growth rates are complex phenotypes and we propose a general growth model that incorporates delays in negative feedback systems regulating growth. We show that the timing of breeding programs intrinsic growth rates in offspring, which suggests that many of the metrics used to describe seasonal patterns of reproductive success may be biased.  2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

The results gave age ratios of 1.07 (but 2.13 in July counts), juvenile sex ratios of 1.01 and adult sex ratios of 1.47. Overall, 12% more females were hatched and female juvenile mortality was 7.3% higher than in males. Sex differential mortality explains the 19.2% deficit in adult females, which are more heavily predated than males during the breeding period. Accordingly, age ratios are dependent on sex ratios and both are density dependent. Over time, ratios and density changes appear to be influenced by weather and management. When the habitat is well conserved, partridge population dynamics can be explained by a causal chain: weather operates on net primary production, thereby affecting partridge reproduction and predation and, as a result, age and sex ratios in the October population. A reduction in the impact of predation (i.e. the effects of ground predators on eggs, chicks and breeding females) is the key factor to improve the conservation of partridge populations and associated biological processes.  2016 Nadal et al.

The FA composition of yolk depends on maternal nutrition and condition prior to egg formation, which may be affected by the external environment. To test if maternal environment affects yolk FA composition, we investigated whether the FA composition of great tit (Parus major) egg yolks differed between urban and rural habitats, and between deciduous and coniferous habitats. The results reveal differences in FA composition between eggs laid in urban and rural habitats, but not between eggs from the coniferous and deciduous habitats. To a large extent, this difference likely reflects dietary differences associated with urban habitats rather than dominating vegetation type. Specifically, urban yolks contained lower proportions of both -3 and -6 polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA), which are important for chick development. We also found a positive association between the proportion of saturated fatty acids and laying date, and a negative association between the proportion of -6 PUFA and clutch size. Given that urbanization is expanding rapidly, future studies should investigate whether factors such as anthropogenic food in the urban environment underlie these differences and whether they impair chick development.  2016, The Author(s)."

These subspecies have diverged over the last 10-15 k years in multiple testosterone-mediated traits, including aggression, ornamentation, and body size. We show that variation in gonadal gene expression along the steroid biosynthetic pathway predicts phenotypic divergence within and among subspecies, and that the more androgenized subspecies exhibits a more prolonged time-course of elevated testosterone following exogenous stimulation. Our results point to specific genes that fulfill key conditions for phenotypic evolution because they vary functionally in their expression among individuals and between populations, and they map onto population variation in phenotype in a common garden. Our findings therefore build an important bridge between hormones, genes, and phenotypic evolution.  2016 Elsevier Inc."

The phenotype, physiology, reproductive function and behavioral characteristics of an organism are not only influenced by genetic factors, but also by environmental factors that play a critical role in shaping offspring morphology. Exposure to excess glucocorticoids during embryonic development influences offspring growth, physiology and behaviors associated with alterations of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and serotonergic system gene expression. Another influential factor for phenotype, physiology and behavioral development is maternal derived steroid hormones that deposit in the egg. In avian species, maternal influences have aroused much attention after the discovery that avian eggs contain a variety of maternal derived steroid hormones. In addition, the environment condition during ontogeny has played a critical role in behavioral development. In avian species, for example laying chicken, high quality mother care produced chicks that were less fearful. Laying hen maternal care is found to reduce cannibalistic pecking phenomenon. Genetic selection and selection experiments will also play a critical role in animals breeding for the housing systems of the future. To optimize animal welfare and to reduce risks factors such as pecking behavior, fundamental approaches are required that merge selection of the optimal genotype with provision of a positive environment for parents and offspring, both throughout ontogeny and later life.  2016 Hainan Medical College"

This has been studied extensively in birds because the embryo develops outside the mother's body, facilitating experimental studies. Some studies have demonstrated that maternal yolk testosterone (T) can have long-lasting effects into the period after fledging. However, these results are based on offspring in the juvenile stage or their first breeding season only. The lack of data further into adulthood limits a better assessment of the fitness consequences of prenatal T. In a series of previous experiments in the rock pigeon, Columba livia, we manipulated yolk T levels using oil-injected eggs as controls. In the present study, we examined the reproductive behaviour of birds from these eggs when they were 1-3 years old and housed together in a large aviary. Our results showed that males from T-injected eggs were less aggressive and females from T-injected eggs laid lighter eggs than controls. Moreover, the experimental birds showed strongly disassortative mating with respect to hormone treatment. There were no indications of treatment effects on the process of sexual differentiation. Our results indicate that the effects of prenatal T do not diminish over age and may last far into adulthood, which should be taken into account in assessing the fitness consequences of maternal hormones. They may also stimulate new physiological and neurobiological studies on the mechanisms underlying such long-lasting effects of prenatal T exposure.  2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

To date, no study has determined the mechanisms mediating this maternal effect's influence on offspring phenotype. However, levels of estrogen receptor alpha (ER) gene expression are linked to differences in early growth and aggression; thus, maternal hormones may alter gene regulation, perhaps via DNA methylation, of ER in offspring during prenatal development. We performed a pilot study to examine natural variation in testosterone allocation to offspring through egg yolks in wild Eastern Bluebirds (Sialia sialis) in varying breeding densities and percent DNA methylation of CG dinucleotides in the ER promoter in offspring brain regions associated with growth and behavior. We hypothesized that breeding density would be positively correlated with yolk testosterone, and prenatal exposure to maternal-derived yolk testosterone would be associated with greater offspring growth and decreased ER promoter methylation. Yolk testosterone concentration was positively correlated with breeding density, nestling growth rate, and percent DNA methylation of one out of five investigated CpG sites (site 3) in the diencephalon ER promoter, but none in the telencephalon (n=10). Percent DNA methylation of diencephalon CpG site 3 was positively correlated with growth rate. These data suggest a possible role for epigenetics in mediating the effects of the maternal environment on offspring phenotype. Experimentally examining this mechanism with a larger sample size in future studies may help elucidate a prominent way in which animals respond to their environment. Further, by determining the mechanisms that mediate maternal effects, we can begin to understand the potential for the heritability of these mechanisms and the impact that maternal effects are capable of producing at an evolutionary scale.  2016 The Authors.

Although persistently high corticosterone levels can be harmful, moderately elevated levels above baseline can lead to reallocation of resources between growth and maintenance to ensure immediate survival or to enhance the development of fitness-related traits. We tested two hypotheses concerning the fitness consequences of elevated corticosterone during prenatal and postnatal development in altricial house wrens: (1) elevated corticosterone shifts resources away from growth and immune function and (2) elevated corticosterone serves as a signal to allocate resources to fitness-related traits. We also explored the development of the stress response, hypothesizing that early-stage nestlings have little endogenously produced corticosterone, but that their baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels increase with age. Nestlings hatching from corticosterone-injected eggs were lighter at hatching, but through compensatory growth, ended up heavier than controls near the time of fledging, an important, fitness-related trait. Nestlings that hatched from corticosterone-injected eggs and those given oral doses of corticosterone did not differ from controls in three other fitness-related traits: immunoresponsiveness, size, or haematocrit. Early- and late-stage nestlings had similar baseline corticosterone levels, and all nestlings increased their plasma corticosterone levels in response to a capture-and-restraint protocol, with older nestlings mounting a stronger stress-induced response than younger nestlings.

Although the degree of intra-clutch egg-size dimorphism varies greatly among the seven species of the genus, obligate brood reduction is typical of each, with most fledged chicks resulting from the larger B-egg. Many authors have speculated upon why Eudyptes penguins have evolved and maintained a highly dimorphic 2-egg clutch, and why it is the first-laid egg that is so much smaller than the second, but only recently has a testable, proximate mechanism been proposed. In most species of Eudyptes penguins females appear to initiate egg-formation at sea during return migration to breeding colonies. In macaroni penguins E. chrysolophus, females with a shorter pre-laying interval ashore (and thus presumably greater overlap between migration and egg-formation) lay more dimorphic eggs, suggesting a physiological conflict may constrain growth of the earlier-initiated A-egg. This migratory carry-over effect hypothesis (MCEH) was tested in eastern rockhopper penguins E. chrysocome filholi on Campbell Island, New Zealand, by recording the arrival and lay dates, body sizes, and egg masses of transponder-tagged females over two years. Females with longer pre-laying intervals laid less dimorphic clutches, as predicted by the MCEH. However, repeated measures of individual females revealed that within-individual variation in egg-size dimorphism between years was unrelated to within-individual variation in pre-laying interval. Egg masses, and to a lesser extent egg-size dimorphism, were highly repeatable traits related to body size and body mass. These results and a detailed consideration of the MCEH suggest that egg-size dimorphism in Eudyptes penguins is unlikely to be caused by a migratory carry-over effect.  2015 The Authors."

Given that global temperatures have warmed approximately 0.6 C in the last century, it is necessary to consider how organisms will adjust to climate change. To better understand the degree to which mothers influence the sex ratios of their offspring, we use 24 years of nesting data for individual female loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) observed on Bald Head Island, North Carolina. We find that maternal identity is the best predictor of nest sex ratio in univariate and multivariate predictive models. We find significant variability in estimated nest sex ratios among mothers, but a high degree of consistency within mothers, despite substantial spatial and temporal thermal variation. Our results suggest that individual differences in nesting preferences are the main driver behind divergences in nest sex ratios. As such, a female's ability to plastically adjust her nest sex ratios in response to environmental conditions is constrained, potentially limiting how individuals behaviorally mitigate the effects of environmental change. Given that many loggerhead populations already show female-biased offspring sex ratios, understanding maternal behavioral responses is critical for predicting the future of long-lived species vulnerable to extinction."

The strain difference in blood and egg yolk IgY concentrations was at most 2.5-fold, between PS and AWE. The rank order of IgY concentrations was AWE, Commercial, DB, L  WE  PS. A significant positive correlation (|R| = 0.786) between individual blood IgY and egg yolk IgY and the concentrated egg yolk IgY (1.5-2-fold) against blood IgY was observed. Interestingly, there was a significant inverse correlation (|R| = 0.452) between injected IgY-Fc uptakes and the blood IgY concentration, implying competition of the injected IgY-Fc and blood IgY in the process of IgY uptake into egg yolks. In conclusion, we successfully determined blood and egg yolk IgY concentrations in various quail strains by a quail IgY-specific ELISA.

These hormones also mediate physiological and behavioral responses to stressful events, allowing individuals to cope with stressors. Various environmental insults, such as a food shortages, predation attempts, and agonistic encounters often elevate plasma glucocorticoid levels in vertebrates. Because exposure to maternally-derived (via circulation or egg) glucocorticoids may be detrimental to the developing embryo, maternal stress can have negative carryover effects on offspring fitness. We examined corticosterone, the primary avian glucocorticoid, concentrations in egg yolk in a plural-breeding, joint-nesting species, the smooth-billed ani (Crotophaga ani), in which females compete among themselves to lay eggs in the final incubated clutch. We investigated whether yolk corticosterone levels varied with laying order and group size. Because egg-laying competition leads to physiological and social stress that is intensified with group size and laying order, we predicted that yolk corticosterone levels should increase from the early to the late egg-laying period and from single female to multi-female groups. In this two-year field study, we found that yolk corticosterone levels of late-laid eggs within the communal clutch were higher in multi-female groups than in single female groups. Results from this study suggest that laying females experience higher levels of stress in multi-female groups and that this maternal stress influences yolk corticosterone concentrations. This study identifies a novel cost of group-living in plural-breeding cooperatively breeding birds, namely an increase in yolk corticosterone levels with group size that may result in detrimental effects on offspring development.  2016 Elsevier Inc."

We explored variation in androstenedione (A4), testosterone (T), 5-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 17-estradiol (E2), and corticosterone (CORT) in the yolks of 12 free-living great tit Parus major clutches. We analyzed variation and covariation in greater detail than previous studies, using models for variation with laying sequence that take into account variable clutch size and comparing correlations between pairs of hormones at the within- and between-clutch levels. We also investigated relationships between hormone levels and various environmental, life history, and parental traits. For three of the five steroids, we found no significant correlates, but based on individual statistical tests (a) DHT varied between clutches with male age (1year old vs older); (b) DHT and CORT were negatively correlated within clutches with the average temperature on the day (DHT and CORT) or 3days (DHT only) preceding laying; and (c) DHT in the last egg of the clutch relative to the clutch mean was positively correlated with the interval between clutch completion and the onset of incubation (incubation delay). Relationships with ambient temperature and incubation delay have not previously been reported for any yolk hormone in birds. Intriguingly, the three relationships for DHT are consistent with more DHT being transferred to eggs in situations that could be more energetically challenging for the female. More research is needed to determine the generality of the patterns we found and to understand their functional significance. Significance statement: The yolks of birds eggs contain steroid hormones produced by the mother which can affect the development and behavior of the resultant chicks. We analyzed five steroid hormones in the yolks of wild great tits and show for the first time that yolk hormone levels are related to ambient temperature in the day(s) just before laying and, in the last-laid egg, with the day it is laid relative to the onset of incubation, and that the concentrations of pairs of yolk hormones can vary with each other in a different way between and within clutches. These results contribute insights into the ways in which yolk hormones may adaptively modify the chicks or may reflect physiological processes occurring in the mother.  2016, The Author(s)."

No differences were detected in maternal cortisol contribution, which is thought to be an important programmer of offspring phenotype. However, once zebrafish offspring began to synthesize cortisol de novo (48 hpf), larvae of dominant females exhibited significantly lower baseline cortisol levels than offspring of subordinate females. These lower cortisol levels may reflect reduced hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis activity, because corticotropin-releasing factor (crf ) and cytochrome p450 side chain cleavage enzyme ( p450scc) mRNA levels also were lower in larvae from dominant females. Moreover, baseline mRNA levels of HPI axis genes continued to be affected by maternal social status beyond 48 hpf. At 144 hpf, stress-induced cortisol levels were significantly lower in offspring of subordinate females.

In birds, differential allocation in egg yolk components can allow mothers to compensate for the competitive disadvantage of junior chicks. We hypothesize that the parent-older chick conflict peaks at intermediate conditions: parents benefit from the younger chick(s) survival, but its death benefits the older chick in terms of growth and survival. We thus expect maternal compensation to follow a bell-shaped pattern in relation to environmental conditions. We studied a black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) population where previous results revealed increased allocation of yolk testosterone in younger as compared to older chicks in intermediate conditions, in line with our theoretical framework. We therefore predicted a maternally induced increase in aggressiveness, growth, and survival for younger chicks born in intermediate environmental conditions. Controlling for parental effects and chick sex, we manipulated food availability before egg laying to create a situation with intermediate (Unfed group) and good (Fed group) environmental conditions. Within each feeding treatment, we further created experimental broods where the natural hatching order was reversed to maximize our chances to observe an effect of feeding treatment on the younger chicks' aggressiveness. As predicted, we found that chick aggressiveness was higher in younger chicks born from the Unfed group (i.e., in intermediate environmental conditions), but only when they were put in a senior position, in reversed broods. Predictions on growth and survival were not confirmed. Mothers thus seem to favor the competitiveness of their younger chick in intermediate conditions via egg yolk components, but our study also suggests that hatching asynchrony need to be small for maternal compensation to be efficient. We emphasize the need for further studies investigating other chick behaviors (e.g., begging) and focusing on the relative role of different yolk components in shaping parent-offspring conflict over sibling competition.  2016 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Here, we incubated eggs of the endangered Magdalena River turtle, Podocnemis lewyana, under 3 relatively constant temperatures and 6 shift-twice treatments. Constant treatments included two 100% masculinizing temperatures that fostered a relatively slower and faster embryo development and one 100% feminizing temperature. The shift treatments included a masculinizing temperature and later a feminizing temperature for a period of time at different incubation stages. Sex ratios were determined by a geometric-morphometric sexing approach developed for this species and validated by gonadal histology. This technique is a nonlethal sexing alternative; thus, it contributes to the conservation of this endangered species. The sex ratios obtained under constant temperatures were more feminized than the sex ratio of another population native to a warmer climate. Shift-twice experiments revealed that pre-TSP temperatures affected the duration of the TSP and as such influenced sex determination. Specifically, at 29C pre-TSP, the TSP lasted 20 d (28% of the incubation period), whereas at 31C pre-TSP, the TSP was extended for 30 d (52% of the incubation period).

Species with variation in either of these parameters should have more potential to adapt to new climatic conditions, therefore putting them at lower risk to global warming. In this study, we incubated eggs of the turtle Podocnemis lewyana (Testudines: Podocnemididae) from two geographically isolated populations (Magdalena and Sin rivers) under controlled microclimatic conditions to corroborate the TSD pattern previously reported for this species and to estimate the degree of inter- and intrapopulation variation in Tpiv and TRT. We used these estimates, together with information found in the literature on other life history traits of P. lewyana, to evaluate its adaptive potential or vulnerability to climate change.

A causal role for PRL in parental care has been established in several mammalian species, but less evidence for a causal role of PRL and parental care exists in birds. The zebra finch, a socially monogamous, biparental songbird, is an exceptionally useful animal model to study parental care and other close social relationships. Both sexes share parental care equally, exhibit the same parental behaviors, and show a marked improvement in breeding success with experience. We hypothesize that PRL is critically involved in the expression of zebra finch parental care and predict that circulating PRL levels will increase with breeding experience. To begin testing this, we measured plasma PRL concentrations in 14 malefemale zebra finch pairs (N=28) across two breeding cycles, using a repeated measures design. PRL was measured in the birds first, reproductively inexperienced, breeding cycle beginning at courtship and extending through chick fledging. PRL was measured again during the birds second, reproductively experienced, breeding cycle, beginning with egg laying until chick fledging. We found that plasma PRL is significantly elevated from non-breeding concentrations during late incubation and early post-hatch care and that this elevation is greater in the reproductively experienced cycle compared to the inexperienced cycle.

Despite the extensive work on Anolis limb length/perch width relationships, however, the availability of perches (a preferred habitat characteristic) influences aspects of fitness is poorly known. In this study, we housed captive male/female pairs of Brown Anoles (Anolis sagrei) in cages with high and low availabilities of perches and quantified the effect of perch availability on perch use and reproductive variables (egg production, egg mass, interegg interval, yolk steroids, egg hatching success). In the low-perch availability treatment, females spent less time on perches than did females in the high-perch availability treatment. Despite this effect on perch use, however, perch availability had little to no effect on reproduction. Egg mass and yolk testosterone concentrations increased over the reproductive season, but perch availability had no effect on any temporal changes in reproductive variables over time.

Egg volume varied among clutches according to clutch size, with eggs being larger in three-egg clutches than in two-egg clutches. Moreover, three-egg clutches showed higher daily survival rates, and hence hatching success, than two-egg clutches. Overall, our results suggest that in the Yellow-legged Gull clutch size covaries with egg volume and hatching success, which could possibly reflect an age effect through different mechanisms. Indeed, older females could be hypothesised to exhibit greater breeding performance than younger females because of their higher experience in tapping energy resources for egg formation and defending nests from dangers. Moreover, due to their age, older females are likely to have lower residual reproductive potential and should invest more heavily in current breeding attempts.  2016 NISC (Pty) Ltd."

Factors such as parental TL, parental age and environmental conditions during development have been shown to contribute to the observed variation in TL among individuals. One factor that has not hitherto been considered is ovulation order, although it is well established that the last hatched/born offspring in a brood or litter often show relatively poor subsequent performance. We examined the within- and across-clutch effect of ovulation order on TL in embryos of zebra finches experiencing the same controlled incubation conditions (N = 151), and tested whether any such ovulation order effects remained detectable in adults (N = 122). Irrespective of clutch and egg size, TL in early-stage embryos (72 h incubation) markedly decreased with within-clutch ovulation order; the difference in TL of first and last-laid embryos was equivalent to the average within-individual telomere loss over the entire period of nestling and juvenile life. This ovulation-order effect occurred only within but not across clutches, and was still evident in adults. Given that TL in early life predicts lifespan, our results suggest that parental effects on telomere length could contribute to the known poor performance of later-ovulated family members."

Until now, most research on sexual conflict over parental care has focused on behavioral mechanisms mediating the resolution of this conflict through negotiation between parents. Here, we review evidence suggesting that maternal effects that alter offspring phenotypes may provide females with a mechanism for manipulating male care. We show that empirical studies on the role of maternal androgens in birds with biparental care provide no support for female manipulation of male care. However, we argue that it would be premature to conclude that maternal androgens play no role in female manipulation of male care given methodological problems in previous work. We then identify a number of additional mechanisms by which females may manipulate male care, including egg components other than androgens, egg size, and egg coloration. We show that there is good evidence that egg coloration affects male care, suggesting that this mechanism warrants further research. We also highlight that current evidence is derived from studies using experimental design that target specific candidate mechanisms, such as maternal androgens. Given the multitude of candidate mechanisms, we discuss an alternative approach based on targeting ecologically relevant prenatal conditions, such as food availability, and monitoring subsequent effects on candidate mechanisms, offspring phenotypes, and male and female care. Finally, we argue that it is timely to extend this work beyond birds with biparental care to include other taxa and species with uniparental male care and cooperative breeding.  2015 The Author."

Maternally derived thyroid hormones (THs) are known to be essential for offspring development in mammalian and fish models, but have been largely neglected in avian studies, especially in respect to natural variation and an ecological context. We studied, for the first time in a wild species and population, the effects of maternally derived THs on offspring development, behavior, physiology and fitness-related traits by experimental elevation of thyroxine and triiodothyronine in ovo within the physiological range in great tits (Parus major). We found that elevated yolk TH levels had a sex-specific effect on growth, increasing male and decreasing female growth, relative to controls, and this effect was similar throughout the nestling period. Hatching or fledging success, motor coordination behavior, stress reactivity and resting metabolic rate were not affected by the TH treatment. We conclude that natural variation in maternally derived THs may affect some offspring traits in a wild species. As this is the first study on yolk thyroid hormones in a wild species and population, more such studies are needed to investigate its effects on pre-hatching development, and juvenile and adult fitness before generalizations on the importance of maternally derived yolk thyroid hormones can be made.

Shortly after the onset of egg laying, T levels slowly decline to baseline levels in both sexes, but more rapidly so in females. During this period, T in males may still function to facilitate territorial behaviour, mate guarding and extra pair copulations, either via short lasting peaks or elevated basal levels of the hormone. In some species, however, males become insensitive to increased T after the onset of egg laying. It has been postulated that in these species bi-parental care is essential for offspring survival, as T is known to inhibit paternal care. However, only very few studies have analysed this for females. As females are heavily involved in parental care, they too might become insensitive to T after egg laying. Alternatively, because territorial defence, mate guarding and extra pair copulations are expected to be less important for females than for males, they may not have had the need to evolve a mechanism to become insensitive to T during the period of maternal care, because their natural T levels are never elevated during this part of the breeding season anyway. We tested these alternative hypotheses in female great tits (Parus major). Male great tits have previously been shown to be insensitive to T after egg laying with regard to nestling feeding behaviour (but not song rate). When females had started nest building, we experimentally elevated their T levels up to the nestling feeding phase, and measured incubation behaviour (only females incubate) and reproductive success. T did not significantly affect nest building or egg laying behaviour, although egg laying tended to be delayed in T females. Females with experimentally enhanced T maintained lower temperature during incubation but did not spend less time incubating. This might explain the reduced hatching success of their eggs, smaller brood size and lower number of fledglings we found in this study. As in this species T-dependent behaviour by females during the phase of parental care is not needed, the results support the hypothesis that in this species the need for selection in favour of T-insensitivity did not occur.  2016 Elsevier Inc.."

To increase life-time fitness, caring parents are, therefore, expected to adjust their reproductive investment to current environmental conditions and parental capacities. The latter is thought to be signaled via ornamental traits of the bearer. We here investigated whether pre- and/or posthatching investment of blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) parents was related to ornamental plumage traits (UV crown coloration and carotenoid-based plumage coloration) expressed by either the individual itself (i.e. ""good parent hypothesis"") or its partner (i.e. ""differential allocation hypothesis""). Our results show that neither prehatching (that is clutch size and offspring begging intensity) nor posthatching parental investment (provisioning rate, offspring body condition at fledging) was related to an individual's UV crown coloration or to that of its partner. Similar observations were made for carotenoid-based plumage coloration, except for a consistent positive relationship between offspring begging intensity and maternal carotenoid-based plumage coloration. This sex-specific pattern likely reflects a maternal effect mediated via maternally derived egg substances, given that the relationship persisted when offspring were cross-fostered. This suggests that females adjust their offspring's phenotype toward own phenotype, which may facilitate in particular mother-offspring co-adaptation. Overall, our results contribute to the current state of evidence that structural or pigment-based plumage coloration of blue tits are inconsistently correlated with central life-history traits.  2016 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

We show that the cytokinesis defects are associated with aberrant cytoskeletal reorganization during furrow maturation, including abnormal F-actin enrichment and microtubule reorganization. Cortical F-actin prior to furrow formation fails to exhibit a normal transition into F-actin-rich arcs, and drug inhibition is consistent with aura function promoting F-actin polymerization and/or stabilization. In mutants, components of exocytic and endocytic vesicles, such as Vamp2, Clathrin and Dynamin, are sequestered in unreleased CGs, indicating a need for CG recycling in the normal redistribution of these factors. However, the exocytic targeting factor Rab11 is recruited to the furrow plane normally at the tip of bundling microtubules, suggesting an alternative anchoring mechanism independent of membrane recycling. A positional cloning approach indicates that the mutation in aura is associated with a truncation of Mid1 interacting protein 1 like (Mid1ip1l), previously identified as an interactor of the X-linked Opitz G/BBB syndrome gene product Mid1. A Cas9/CRISPR-induced mutant allele in mid1ip1l fails to complement the originally isolated aura maternal-effect mutation, confirming gene assignment. Mid1ip1l protein localizes to cortical F-actin aggregates, consistent with a direct role in cytoskeletal regulation.

Methods: We injected low (0.2 g) and high (1.0 g) doses of corticosterone (CORT) in ovo before incubation and measured the changes in GCs metabolic enzymes genes in ovarian follicles 1 (F1), F2 and F3 post hatching. Results: The high dose CORT treatment significantly (P < 0.0) decreased 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11-HSD1) mRNA expression in F1, F2, F3 and in the ovary compared to the control and low groups.

However, on the proximate level, it is difficult to determine who plays the most important role in this process, parents or offspring. For several vertebrate taxa, it has been documented that parents end brood care by abandoning offspring after a fixed period or else show high flexibility in the duration of care, but teasing apart the role of offspring and parents underlying this flexibility has been difficult. Here, we studied the decision to fledge in captive zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), an altricial songbird. We experimentally delayed the time of fledging to determine who decides about the end of feeding inside the nest, parents or offspring. The experiment indicates that parents do not primarily rely on phenotypic offspring traits in their decision to feed offspring in the nest, but appear to adjust the duration of parental care as long as offspring are in the nest which parents may take as an indicator of offspring need and locomotor abilities. Delayed-fledging offspring appeared not to suffer a disadvantage in terms of age at the onset of independent feeding. Our study suggests that, in zebra finches, offspring play a major role in determining the time of fledging and leave the nest on their own, possibly to reduce the risk of nest predation, or to evade sibling competition in the nest.  2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH."

It is used by offspring to trigger the transfer of parental resources while at the same time allowing parents to access cryptic information about their offspring's need. But in a brood of more than one, offspring may gain indirect fitness benefits from responding to the need of its (related) siblings, not to withdraw all resources, especially if these are needier and would possibly contest more vigorously. Thus each offspring is thought to adjust its begging behaviour to its own intrinsic need as well as to its social environment, which is also shaped by the parents potentially having control over the distribution of resources. Here, we experimentally satiated the heaviest nestling within canary broods, Serinus canaria, in order to analyse: (1) whether nestlings honestly communicate their intrinsic hunger level; (2) whether nestlings adjust their begging behaviour to the need of their siblings; and (3) how parents respond to these begging strategies. Only female nestlings responded honestly, begging significantly less when satiated. Male nestlings, by contrast, did not alter their begging according to the level of satiation. Nestlings only weakly responded to the need of their siblings, and again only female nestlings did so. Thus female nestlings appear to be more sensitive to both intrinsic need and changes in their social environment, potentially owing to their lower competitiveness. Parents preferentially fed needier nestlings irrespective of the observed sex differences in begging strategies. They appear to control food distribution according to (cryptic) signals of need, which is important to take into account when studying the adaptive significance of any begging behaviour and strategy.  2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

Here we compare these organizational effects of perinatal androgens in closely related Nazca (Sula granti) and blue-footed (S. nebouxii) boobies that differ in neonatal social system. The older of two Nazca booby hatchlings unconditionally attacks and ejects the younger from the nest within days of hatching, while blue-footed booby neonates lack lethalaggression. Both Nazca booby chicks facultatively upregulate testosterone (T) during fights, motivating the prediction that baseline androgen levels differ between obligately siblicidal and other species. Methodology/Principal Findings We show that obligately siblicidal Nazca boobies hatch with higher circulating androgen levels than do facultatively siblicidal blue-footed boobies, providing comparative evidence of the role of androgens in sociality. Although androgens confer a short-term benefit of increased aggression to Nazca booby neonates, exposure to elevated androgen levels during this sensitive period in development can also induce long-term organizational effects on behavior or morphology. Adult Nazca boobies show evidence of organizational effects of early androgen exposure in aberrant adult behavior: they visit unattended non-familial chicks in the colony and direct mixtures of aggression, affiliative, and sexual behavior toward them. In a longitudinal analysis, we found that the most active Non-parental Adult Visitors (NAVs) were those with a history of siblicidal behavior as a neonate, suggesting that the tendency to show social interest in chicks is programd, in part, by the high perinatal androgens associated with obligate siblicide. Data from closely related blue-footed boobies provide comparative support for this interpretation. Lacking obligate siblicide, they hatch with a corresponding low androgen level, and blue-footed booby adults show a much lower frequency of NAV behavior and a lower probability of behaving aggressively during NAV interactions. This species difference in adult social behavior appears to have roots in both pleiotropic and experiential effects of nestling social system. Conclusions/Significance Our results indicate that Nazca boobies experience life-long consequences of androgenic preparation for an early battle to the death.  2011 by Apple Academic Press, Inc."

However, the long-term consequences of variation in maternal carotenoid transfer for the offspring have seldom been considered. Since plasma carotenoid levels at adulthood are known to influence testis size and yolk carotenoid levels influence the ability to extract carotenoids later in life, we hypothesized that maternally transmitted carotenoids might influence gonad size at adulthood. Here, we showed that male Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) originating from a carotenoid-enriched egg had smaller testes than control individuals at adulthood. This result shows that yolk carotenoids have long-term organizational effects. In addition, given that carotenoid intake at sexual maturity increases sperm quality and that a decreased testis size is associated with a lower sperm production, we propose that carotenoid exposure during embryo development might influence a trade-off between ejaculate size and sperm quality.  2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The ontogenetic processes that control lateralization, however, are largely unknown. Well-established sex-dependence in androgen physiology and sex-dependent variation in lateralization have led to the hypothesis that testosterone (T) has organizational effects on lateralization. The effects of T exposure in early life on lateralization can be efficiently investigated by manipulating T levels in the cleidoic eggs of birds, because the embryo is isolated from maternal and sibling physiological interference, but this approach has been adopted very rarely. In the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) we increased yolk T concentration within the physiological limits and tested the effects on the direction of lateralization in two functionally fundamental behaviors (begging for parental care and escape to cover) of molecularly sexed hatchlings. We also speculated that T may intervene in regulating consistency, rather than direction of lateralization, and therefore tested if T affected the 'repeatability' of lateral preference in consecutive behavioral trials. T treatment had no effect on the direction of lateralization, but enhanced the consistency of lateral preference in escape responses. Sex did not predict lateralization. Neither behavior was lateralized at the population-level. We therefore showed for the first time in any species an effect of egg T on consistency in lateralization. The implications of the effect of T for the evolution of trade-offs in maternal allocation of egg hormones, and the evolutionary interpretations of findings from our studies on lateralization among unmanipulated birds are discussed.  2016 Elsevier Inc."

In two replicates of urban and forest habitats, we studied the components of reproductive success. In one replicate of each habitat, we quantified nestling growth over the three breeding seasons, and we collected data on egg quality during one breeding season. The general picture that emerges from our finding is that in urban sites breeding success was lower with smaller clutch sizes, higher clutch, higher brood failure rates and lower survival rates. Our results also showed reduced growth in urban habitats, at the embryonic and nestling stages, with potential adverse consequences on fitness. Crucial ecological factors could explain the observed contrasts between the habitats, and food limitation is among the most likely. Overall, we demonstrated the negative effects of urbanization on the reproductive success of forest birds, and our results were consistent between species and geographic areas for these negative effects.

In a population of Eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) with repeatable behavioral expression and coordination of behavior within pairs, we tested if baseline androgen and corticosterone levels are related to behavioral expression, if coordination in behavior within pairs is facilitated by hormonal coordination, and if baseline hormone levels are related to fledging success at the individual or pair level. We found no significant relationship between hormone levels and nest visit rate or nest defense for either sex. Androgen and corticosterone levels were not correlated within pairs, but pairs in which males exhibited more aggressive nest defense behavior than females were also more different in androgen levels.

While embryos of placental vertebrates are known to regulate exposure to maternal glucocorticoids via placental steroid metabolism, much less is known about how and whether egg-laying vertebrates can control their steroid environment during embryonic development. We tested the hypothesis that threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) embryos can regulate exposure to maternal steroids via active efflux of maternal steroids from the egg. Embryos rapidly (within 72 h) cleared intact steroids, but blocking ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters inhibited cortisol clearance. Remarkably, this efflux of cortisol was sufficient to prevent a transcriptional response of embryos to exogenous cortisol. Taken together, these findings suggest that, much like their placental counterparts, developing fish embryos can actively regulate their exposure to maternal cortisol. These findings highlight the fact that even in egg-laying vertebrates, the realized exposure to maternal steroids is mediated by both maternal and embryonic processes and this has important implications for understanding how maternal stress influences offspring development.  2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

To identify sources of variation in circulating white blood cell (WBC) concentrations and differentials, we examined blood smears from 246 hatchling snakes and their field-caught mothers. WBC concentrations were lower in hatchlings than in adults, and hatchlings had more basophils and fewer azurophils than adults. A hatchling keelbacks WBC differential was also influenced by its sex and body size. Although hatchling WBC measures exhibited negligible heritability, they were strongly influenced by maternal body size and parasite infection (but not by maternal body condition, relative clutch mass or time in captivity). Larger mothers produced offspring with more azurophils and fewer lymphocytes.

A recently revised version of the DAH makes explicit that investment can be positive, i.e. higher for the offspring of attractive males which should be of higher quality, or negative, i.e. higher for offspring of unattractive males, for example compensating for inheriting poor paternal genes. Moreover, investment can be made by the father and the mother. Here, we tested whether experimental manipulation of male attractiveness affected parental investment at different reproductive stages and thus influenced fitness-related traits in offspring. In two aviaries, all male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, were given red leg rings to increase attractiveness and in two aviaries all males received green leg rings to decrease attractiveness. This controlled for assortative mating between treatments. Ring colour was merely an experimental manipulation of male attractiveness, not paternal quality, so we might expect additional investment to elevate offspring quality. Eggs were cross-fostered between and within treatments to allow differentiation of effects of investment in eggs and nestlings. Clutch and brood sizes were standardized. Both positive and negative investment were observed: Eggs from red-ringed fathers had higher yolk to albumen ratios than eggs from green-ringed fathers. Nestlings from eggs laid and incubated by parents in the red-ringed group had higher hatching masses than those in the green-ringed group. Both parents in the green-ringed group fed nestlings more frequently than red-ringed parents. Offspring performance was influenced by the treatment of both foster and biological parents, but combined effects of these different investment patterns on fitness-related traits were ambiguous. Male attractiveness appeared to affect patterns of reproductive investment but not consistently across all forms of reproductive investment suggesting that the costs and benefits of differential allocation vary among individuals and across contexts.  2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

However, the mechanisms that give rise to this behavioral variation are often unclear. This study investigated the influence of environmental manipulations during development on behavioral variation in hatchlings of the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta). First, we examined the effects of three manipulations during incubation (estrone sulfate exposure, corticosterone exposure, and thermal fluctuations) on hatchling righting response and exploration. Second, we determined whether hatchlings showed consistent differences (i.e. behavioral types) in their righting response and exploration across days and months, and whether these behaviors were correlated with one another. Finally, we examined whether righting response was predictive of ecologically relevant behaviors such as habitat choice and dispersal. Hatchling behavior was robust to our early manipulations; none of the pre-hatch treatments affected later behavior. There were significant clutch effects, which due to the split-clutch design suggests genetic underpinnings and/or maternal effects. We found evidence for behavioral types in turtles; both righting response and exploration were strongly repeatable and these behaviors were positively correlated. Righting response was not predictive of dispersal ability in the field, necessitating a revision in the general interpretations of righting response as a proxy for dispersal ability in turtles. Thus, turtle hatchlings show consistent behavioral differences that are robust to early developmental manipulations, and while not necessarily predictive of dispersal, these behavioral types can have important consequences throughout ontogeny.  2015 Elsevier Inc."

Using Barn Swallows Hirundo rustica, we found that the duration of female incubation off-bouts increased with a sexually selected trait, male throat coloration, independent of female nest attentiveness. A longer female off-bout was positively correlated with the incubation period, indicating that colorful males had reproductive disadvantage because of their mates' inefficient incubation. Together with a previous study in which females demonstrated a higher amount of incubation when their mates had large white tail spots, another sexually selected trait, our findings indicated that the different aspects of parental care are differently related to male ornaments.

We analysed associations between natural variation in haematology in free-living European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and reproductive performance. To test whether transient reductions in haematology during different stages of reproduction (egg production and late incubation/early chick rearing) affected measures of reproductive performance, we also manipulated haematology using phenylhydrazine (PHZ), which lyses red blood cells. To investigate effects of reductions of haematology during egg-laying, we treated females with PHZ or saline (control) upon completion of their unmanipulated first clutch and removed eggs to induce the production and rearing of a replacement clutch. To investigate effects of reductions of haematology during chick rearing, we treated females during incubation of the unmanipulated first clutch and then monitored the subsequent hatching and rearing of the clutch. Individuals with higher haematocrit and haemoglobin initiated nesting earlier. Furthermore, higher haemoglobin levels during incubation were associated with a greater number of chicks fledged. PHZ treatment prior to egg production resulted in a significant delay in the laying of replacement clutches, but had no effect on provisioning rate or the size or number of chicks fledged. PHZ treatment during incubation and early chick rearing resulted in decreased hatchling mass in all years and a decrease in the size and number of fledglings in one of 2years. The year that the effect of PHZ was observed appeared to be a particularly difficult year, as hatchling mass, brood size at hatching and at fledging were low among control females compared to other years.

A marker of total antioxidant status (TAS) in plasma and total levels of glutathione (GSH) in red blood cells, as well as a marker of oxidative damage in plasma lipids (malondialdehyde [MDA]), were assessed simultaneously. Our results show that nestling total GSH levels were associated with parental oxidative status, correlating negatively with maternal MDA and positively with total GSH levels of both parents, with a high estimated heritability. This suggests that parental physiology and genes could be determinants for endogenous components of the antioxidant system of the offspring. Moreover, we found that total GSH levels were higher in female than in male nestlings and that hatching date was positively associated with antioxidant defenses (higher TAS and total GSH levels).

In birds, recognition of family members has almost exclusively been studied between parents and offspring or within cooperatively breeding societies. Yet, recognition of nest-mates could be of special importance in recently fledged birds of colonial species by helping in locating the nest, maintaining family group cohesion, or allowing detection of feeding opportunities by recognizing the begging calls nest-mates produced on the return of a parent. Here we study nest-mate discrimination based on begging calls in fledglings of domesticated zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), a gregarious songbird living in loose colonies in which juveniles may gather in crches and are fed by parents up to 20 d after fledging. Using playback tests, we show that fledglings called more and spent more time near the loudspeaker in response to the begging calls of their nest-mates than to the calls of other familiar individuals. Because each fledgling was exposed to the repeated association of the begging calls of its nest-mates and the subsequent feeding of its parents, this preferential response to the nest-mates' calls could be a conditioned response to the food reward. Whereas fledglings answered more to male fledgling calls than to female fledgling calls, response to playback was influenced neither by the sex of the subject nor by its brood size. Discriminant function analysis based on acoustic parameters showed that begging calls carried an individual signature as well as a brood signature which might account for such nest-mate discrimination. Begging signals are major study systems of the evolution of communication in the face of conflicts of interest between signalers and receivers.

Here, we show that the probability of having a son increased from 0.31 to 0.60 with sire reproductive success in wild bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis). Furthermore, our results suggest that females fertilized by relatively unsuccessful sires allocated more energy during lactation to daughters than to sons, while the opposite occurred for females fertilized by successful sires. The pattern of sex-biased offspring production appears adaptive because paternal reproductive success reduced the fitness of daughters and increased the average annual weaning success of sons, independently of maternal allocation to the offspring.

Atlantic salmon Salmo salar (Linnaeus) show some of the greatest within-population variability in life history strategies amongst vertebrates, with multiple discrete male and female life histories co-existing and interbreeding on many spawning grounds, although the effect of the various combinations of life histories on offspring traits remains unknown. Using crosses of wild fish we show here that the life history strategy of both parents was significantly associated with a range of offspring traits. Mothers that had spent longer at sea (2 versus 1 year) produced offspring that were heavier, longer and in better condition at the time of first feeding. However, these relationships disappeared shortly after fry had begun feeding exogenously. At this stage, the juvenile rearing environment (i.e. time spent in fresh water as juveniles) of the mother was a better predictor of offspring traits, with mothers that were faster to develop in fresh water (migrating to sea after two rather than three years of age) producing offspring that had higher maximal metabolic rates, aerobic scopes, and that grew faster. Faster developing fathers (1 year old sneaker males) tended to produce offspring that had higher maximal metabolic rates, were in better body condition and grew faster. The results suggest that both genetic effects and those related to parental early and late life history contribute to offspring traits.  2016. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd."

Here, we explored the role of T levels in female-female competition in a songbird, the pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca. In an experiment with female decoys placed close to the nestbox at the end of laying, we explored if female aggressiveness is related to their own T level or to mate T level. T levels of males and females were measured in the middle of the nestling period. Mean female aggressiveness towards decoys in three presentations was estimated through proximity to the decoy and number of attacks by females, two variables which were positively associated. Aggressiveness by female nest owners to female decoys was negatively related to male T level but unrelated to own T level. There was no assortative mating with respect to T level. Female aggressiveness is more strongly related to the hormonal status of mates than to their own.  2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and ISPA."

Due to the reciprocal nature of these interactions, it has been hypothesized that parental and offspring behaviours (e.g. parental food provisioning and offspring begging) are not only target but also agent of selection. These traits are therefore expected to co-evolve, ultimately leading to co-adaptation of parent and offspring behaviours within families. However, empirical data on such parent-offspring co-adaptation are limited, particularly for wild populations. Furthermore, mean levels of behaviour (as measured in previous studies) may not adequately describe the dynamic nature of the reciprocal interplay between parents and their offspring, and instead rather the behavioural reaction norms for provisioning and begging may be co-adapted. We applied a large-scale cross-fostering study over 3 consecutive breeding seasons to investigate whether provisioning behaviour of wild blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) parents covaries with the begging behaviour of their genetic, cross-fostered offspring. We simultaneously analysed parent and offspring behaviours, both as static traits (mean levels) and behavioural reaction norms (offspring begging as a function of food deprivation and parental provisioning as a function of short-term experimental changes in brood size). Neither maternal nor paternal provisioning rates covaried with the begging intensity of their genetic offspring when analysed as mean levels of behaviour. However, the slopes of the reaction norms for provisioning and begging were negatively correlated between male, but not female, parents and their genetic offspring. Thus, fathers that change their provisioning rate strongly with brood size sire offspring whose level of begging only weakly increases with hunger, and vice versa. The observed covariation suggests the existence of sex-specific optima for parent-offspring trait combinations. Thus, our study not only highlights the importance of a behavioural reaction norm approach when investigating parent-offspring interactions, but also stresses the relevance of considering parents as separate units, at least for biparental species.  2016 British Ecological Society."

BMR has also been shown to be positively related to sustainable work rate and maximal thermoregulatory capacity. To this date, most of the studies have focused on the causes of interspecific and intraspecific variation in BMR, and fairly little is known about the fitness consequences of different metabolic strategies. In this study, we show that winter BMR affects local survival in a population of wild blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), but that the selection direction differs between years. We argue that this fluctuating selection is probably a consequence of varying winter climate with a positive relation between survival and BMR during cold and harsh conditions, but a negative relation during mild winters. This fluctuating selection can not only explain the pronounced variation in BMR in wild populations, but will also give us new insights into how energy turnover rates can shape the life-history strategies of animals. Furthermore, the study shows that the process of global warming may cause directional selection for a general reduction in BMR, affecting the general life-history strategy on the population level.  2016 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Modification of telomere length, as a result of adversity faced early in life, can modify an individual's phenotype. Studies in captivity have suggested a relationship between glucocorticoids and telomere length in developing individuals, however less is known about that relationship in natural populations. Methods: In order to evaluate the effect of early environmental stressors on telomere length in natural populations, we compared baseline corticosterone (CORT) levels and telomere length in nestlings of the same age. We collected blood samples for hormone assay and telomere determination from two geographically distinct populations of the Thorn-tailed Rayadito (Aphrastura spinicauda) that differed in brood size; nestlings body mass and primary productivity. Within each population we used path analysis to evaluate the relationship between brood size, body mass, baseline CORT and telomere length. Results: Within each distinct population, path coefficients showed a positive relationship between brood size and baseline CORT and a strong and negative correlation between baseline CORT and telomere length. In general, nestlings that presented higher baseline CORT levels tended to present shorter telomeres. When comparing populations it was the low latitude population that presented higher levels of baseline CORT and shorter telomere length. Conclusions: Taken together our results reveal the importance of the condition experienced early in life in affecting telomere length, and the relevance of integrative studies carried out in natural conditions.  2016 Quirici et al."

The prenatal environment of poultry can be divided into the pre-lay environment and the egg storage/incubation environment, both of which can affect offspring outcomes. The ability to separate maternal and egg/incubation effects makes birds well suited to this type of research. There are many factors, including feeding and nutrition, environmental conditions, husbandry practices, housing system, social environment, infectious environment, and maternal health status, that can influence both the health and performance and behavior and cognition of the offspring. There are some aspects of the environments that can be changed to produce beneficial effects in the offspring, like addition of certain additives to feed or short changes in incubation temperatures, while other aspects should be avoided to reduce negative effects, such as unpredictable feeding and lighting regimens. Measures of offspring characteristics may prove to be a useful method of assessing parent stock welfare if known stressors result in predictable offspring outcomes. This has the advantage of assessing the parent environment without interfering with the animals and possibly affecting their responses and could lead to improved welfare for the animals.  2016 The Author 2015.

We administered repeated oral doses of the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT) to ovulating Zebra Finches (Taeniopygia guttata) in order to mimic a disruptive environment, and investigated the effect on their reproductive output as well as outcomes for their offspring. Although females treated with CORT produced larger clutches than control females, hatching success was significantly reduced in the CORT-treated group, though there was no evidence of bias in offspring sex-ratio. Both treatment and sex had an effect on the size of chicks at hatching and their growth rate. Chicks from the experimental group were smaller at hatching than control chicks but grew faster. Similarly, male chicks were smaller than female chicks at hatching but grew faster than females. However, there was no significant difference in overall condition at nutritional independence, indicating that increased growth rates resulted from compensatory growth. These results have broad evolutionary implications, as maternal CORT is capable of affecting viability of eggs and offspring phenotype, even when maternal diet and body condition remain unchanged. As such, glucocorticoids may play a role in regulating population productivity and offspring phenotype, which provides a promising area for further research into the effects of maternal stress on adult offspring in successive generations.

Mothers may adjust different egg components in different ways in reaction to environmental cues either to adjust offspring development or because of constraints. In this study, we investigated the effects of food quality and quantity before and during egg laying on three different aspects of egg quality: macro-nutrients (egg and yolk mass), androgens (testosterone and androstenedione), and thyroid hormones (3,5,3-triiodothyronine, T3 and l-thyroxine, T4), using the rock pigeon (Columba livia). As expected, egg and yolk mass were significantly reduced for the eggs laid under the poor-food condition, indicating a maternal trade-off between offspring and self in allocating important resources. We did not find any significant change in yolk testosterone or their within-clutch pattern over the laying sequence. This is consistent with the fact that, in contrast with nutrients, these hormones are not costly to produce, but does not support the hypothesis that they play a role in adjusting brood size to food conditions. In contrast, we found that T3 levels were higher in the egg yolks under the poor-food condition whereas the total T4 content was lower. This change could be related to the fact that iodine, the critical constituent of thyroid hormones, might be a limiting factor in the production of this hormone. Given the knowledge that food restriction usually lead to reduction of circulating T3 levels, our results suggested that avian mothers can independently regulate its concentrations in their eggs from their own circulation. The study demonstrates that environmentally induced maternal effects via the egg can be a result of a combination of constrained resources and unconstrained signals and that thyroid hormones might be an interesting case of both. Therefore, this hormone and the interplay of different maternal effects on the offspring phenotype deserve much more attention.  2016 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

It suggests that costs for the offspring or the mother constrain the evolution of maternal hormone transfer. However, to date, the nature of these costs remains poorly understood. Unlike most previous work that focused on potential costs for the offspring, we here investigated whether high yolk testosterone transfer is associated with metabolic costs (i.e., a higher metabolic rate) for the mother. We show that Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) females that deposit higher testosterone concentrations into their eggs have a higher resting metabolic rate. Because a higher metabolic rate is often associated with a shorter life span, this relationship may explain the negative association between yolk testosterone transfer and female longevity observed in the wild.

Our treatment groups were: 1) food supplementation (mealworms) from the 1st until the last egg; 2) food supplementation from the 1st until the 5th egg, where the effect of cessation of the supplementary food treatment could also be studied; 3) no food supplementation (controls). We analysed both nutritional resources (egg, yolk and albumen mass), and the important developmental signals, yolk androgens (testosterone and androstenedione), and for the first time in a wild population, yolk thyroid hormones (thyroxine and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine). Egg mass is a costly resource for females, androgens most likely non-costly signals, whereas thyroid hormones may be costly signals, requiring environmental iodine. In the food supplemented group egg, yolk and albumen mass increased rapidly relative to controls and when food supplementation was halted, egg and albumen mass decreased, indicating rapid responses to resource availability. Yolk androgen and thyroid hormone levels were not affected by food supplementation during laying. Thyroxine showed an increase over the laying sequence and its biological meaning needs further study. The rapid changes in egg mass to variation in within-clutch food availability suggest energetic/protein/nutrient constrains on egg formation. The lack of a response in yolk hormones suggest that perhaps in this species the short-term changes in resource availability during egg laying do not predict offspring rearing conditions, or (for thyroid hormones) do not cause systemic changes in circulating hormones, and hence do not affect maternal signaling.  2016 Nordic Society Oikos."

In addition, we studied how experimentally changing the brood size affected offspring condition and their recruitment. We show that females (but not males) rearing enlarged broods had lower local survival compared to those rearing reduced or control broods. This indicates a sexual conflict concerning optimal brood size. However, even though brood size manipulation did not affect the local survival of males, it did have an influence on the dorsal melanin coloration of young males. Young males rearing enlarged broods showed a stronger increase in plumage darkness from the current to the next breeding season than those rearing reduced or control broods. This suggests that stress experienced during reproduction might have carry-over effects that influence the complicated melanocortin system and lead to changes in the expression of melanin-based coloration. Alternatively, successful breeding might have stimulated young males to further invest in reproduction in the following season.

A key area of extensive study using bird embryos centers on developmental phenotypic plasticity of the cardio-respiratory system and how its normal development can be affected by abiotic factors such as temperature and oxygen availability. Through the investigation of the plasticity of development, we gain a better understanding of both the regulation of the developmental process and the embryo's capacity for self-repair. Additionally, experiments with abiotic and biotic stressors during development have helped delineate not just critical windows for avian cardio-respiratory development, but the general characteristics (e.g., timing and dose-dependence) of critical windows in all developing vertebrates. Avian embryos are useful in exploring fetal programming, in which early developmental experiences have implications (usually negative) later in life. The ability to experimentally manipulate the avian embryo without the interference of maternal behavior or physiology makes it particularly useful in future studies of fetal programming. The bird embryo is also a key participant in studies of transgenerational epigenetics, whether by egg provisioning or effects on the germline that are transmitted to the F1 generation (or beyond). Finally, the avian embryo is heavily exploited in toxicology, in which both toxicological testing of potential consumer products as well as the consequences of exposure to anthropogenic pollutants are routinely carried out in the avian embryo.

We tested the hypothesis that maternal cortisol is essential for the proper development of hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis activity and the onset of the stressorinduced cortisol response in larval zebrafish. In this study, zygotic cortisol content was manipulated by microinjecting antibody to sequester this steroid, thereby making it unavailable during embryogenesis. This was compared with embryos containing excess cortisol by microinjection of exogenous steroid. The resulting larval phenotypes revealed distinct treatment effects, including deformed mesoderm structures when maternal cortisol was unavailable and cardiac edema after excess cortisol. Maternal cortisol unavailability heightened the cortisol stress response in post-hatch larvae, whereas excess cortisol abolished the stressor-mediated cortisol elevation. This contrasting hormonal response corresponded with altered expression of key HPI axis genes, including crf, 11B hydroxylase, pomca, and star, which were upregulated in response to reduced cortisol availability and downregulated when embryos had excess cortisol. These findings for the first time underscore a critical role for maternally deposited cortisol in programming HPI axis development and function in zebrafish."

Although paternal care is generally rare among vertebrates, care of eggs and young by male birds is extremely common and may take on a variety of forms across species. Thus, birds provide ample opportunities for investigating both the evolution of and the proximate mechanisms underpinning diverse aspects of fathering behavior. However, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the endocrine and neuroendocrine influences on paternal care in this vertebrate group. In this review, I focus on proximate mechanisms of paternal care in birds. I place an emphasis on specific hormones that vary predictably and/or unpredictably during the parental phase in both captive and wild birds: prolactin and progesterone are generally assumed to enhance paternal care, whereas testosterone and corticosterone are commonly-though not always correctly-assumed to inhibit paternal care. In addition, because endocrine secretions are not the sole mechanistic influence on paternal behavior, I also explore potential roles for certain neuropeptide systems (specifically the oxytocin-vasopressin nonapeptides and gonadotropin inhibitory hormone) and social and experiential factors in influencing paternal behavior in birds. Ultimately, mechanistic control of fathering behavior in birds is complex, and I suggest specific avenues for future research with the goal of narrowing gaps in our understanding of this complexity. Such avenues include (1) experimental studies that carefully consider not only endocrine and neuroendocrine mechanisms of paternal behavior, but also the ecology, phylogenetic history, and social context of focal species; (2) investigations that focus on individual variation in both hormonal and behavioral responses during the parental phase; (3) studies that investigate mechanisms of maternal and paternal care independently, rather than assuming that the mechanistic foundations of care are similar between the sexes; (4) expansion of work on interactions of the neuroendocrine system and fathering behavior to a wider array of paternal behaviors and taxa (e.g., currently, studies of the interactions of testosterone and paternal care largely focus on songbirds, whereas studies of the interactions of corticosterone, prolactin, and paternal care in times of stress focus primarily on seabirds); and (5) more deliberate study of exceptions to commonly held assumptions about hormone-paternal behavior interactions (such as the prevailing assumptions that elevations in androgens and glucocorticoids are universally disruptive to paternal care). Ultimately, investigations that take an intentionally integrative approach to understanding the social, evolutionary, and physiological influences on fathering behavior will make great strides toward refining our understanding of the complex nature by which paternal behavior in birds is regulated.  2015 Elsevier Inc."

Fire salamanders represent an interesting system due to their biphasic life cycle consisting of an aquatic larval stage and a subsequent terrestrial stage. The environment experienced as larvae affects growth, age at metamorphosis and behaviour. In particular, diet restrictions can cause developmental stress. However, the impact of such developmental stress on the growth and behaviour in a long-lived amphibian are not yet well studied. We manipulated the early diet of sibling pairs of fire salamander larvae. One sibling was raised under food-restriction and the other was raised under conditions of abundant food. We report long-term effects on growth and exploratory behaviour; exploratory behaviour was tested in two sessions, first as young juveniles and later as subadults. We found that food-restricted conditions during early development affected exploratory behaviour. Early deficits in body mass and body size were compensated later in life, by approximately 18 months of age. When morphological differences were compensated, the initial differences in exploratory behaviour also disappeared. Thus, compensation not only led to an alignment of body parameters but was also accompanied by an adjustment in exploratory behaviour. No cost of compensation was detected, but future research will need to verify whether the potential costs of compensation are negligible in slowgrowing salamanders or whether they are shifted to later life stages. Our study provides novel insights into the life history of fire salamanders and reveals that early larval conditions have effects on individuals long after metamorphosis.

The aim of this study was to assess the potential toxicity of environmental levels of PFOS to yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) embryos under field experimental conditions. In a within-clutch experimental design, we injected two PFOS concentrations (100ng PFOS/g egg weight and 200ng PFOS/g egg weight) in ovo soon after laying. Eggs were collected when they reached the cracking stage. We investigated the effects of PFOS treatment, laying order and sex on both morphological and biochemical endpoints of embryos. Specifically, we assessed changes in embryo body mass and tarsus length, as well as in liver and brain mass. Moreover, the imbalance of oxidative status was evaluated in both liver and brain from embryos by measuring total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and total oxidant status (TOS), while the levels of protein carbonyl content (PCO) and DNA fragmentation were measured as oxidative and genetic damage endpoints, respectively. The concentrations of PFOS we tested did not significantly alter the morphological endpoints, independently of laying order and sex. Similarly, embryo oxidative status and oxidative and genetic damage were not significantly affected by PFOS in ovo exposure. These findings suggest that current environmental PFOS levels do not affect early development of yellow-legged gull embryos.  2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Because of their role in oxidative stress, the deposition of eggshell pigments might be condition-dependent. However, because of the fitness benefits of eggshell coloration, cryptic eggshell appearance should be strongly conserved in ground-nesting species regardless of female condition and eggshell pigment concentrations. We investigated whether Japanese quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica) maintained eggshell maculation under food restriction. We quantified eggshell maculation (i.e., percentage of spot coverage) using digital photography, and both protoporphyrin and biliverdin concentrations of eggs laid by females either on a food-restricted or an ad libitum diet. Females on a high quality diet, which are known to decrease the deposition of eggshell protoporphyrin, decreased eggshell maculation compared with food-restricted females that maintained it.

The EL interval was 97.9  3.6 h (range: 84-108 h) and paternity analyses revealed that conceptive inseminations occurred from 11.5 to 4.5 days before oviposition. A biphasic pattern of estradiol, testosterone, progesterone and the biochemical analytes triglyceride, iron, calcium and phosphorus occurred in relation to EL, with values increasing (P< 0.05) to maximal concentrations during the three weeks preceding oviposition, then decreasing (P< 0.05) rapidly after oviposition completion. In comparison with post-lay (baseline) values, concentrations of estradiol and testosterone relative to the first oviposition were elevated at Week-5, and those of triglyceride, a yolk formation index, as well as iron, calcium and phosphorus, became elevated at Week-4 (P< 0.05). Collective data indicate an estimated total egg formation interval of 29. days, with oviducal transit of the ovulated ovum occurring over the majority of the 4. day EL interval. These findings indicate that egg formation is prolonged with folliculogenesis initiated at 5. weeks or more prior to oviposition.

In vertebrates, adjustments of physiology and behavior to environmental changes are often mediated by central physiological mechanisms, and more specifically by hormonal mechanisms. As a consequence, these mechanisms are thought to orchestrate life-history decisions in wild vertebrates. For instance, investigating the hormonal regulation of parental behavior is relevant to evaluate how parents modulate their effort according to specific environmental conditions. Surprisingly and despite being classically known as the 'parental hormone', prolactin has been overlooked in birds relative to this context. Our aim is to review evidence that changes in prolactin levels can mediate, at least to some extent, the response of breeding birds to environmental conditions. To do so, we first examine current evidence and limits for the role of prolactin in mediating parental behavior in birds. Second, we emphasize the influence of environmental conditions and stressors on circulating prolactin levels. In addition, we review to what extent prolactin levels are a reliable predictor of breeding success in wild birds. By linking environmental conditions, prolactin regulation, parental behavior, and breeding success, we highlight the potential role of this hormone in mediating parental decisions in birds. Finally, we also review the potential role of prolactin in mediating other life history decisions such as clutch size, re-nesting, and the timing of molt. By evaluating the influence of stressors on circulating prolactin levels during these other life-history decisions, we also raise new hypotheses regarding the potential of the prolactin stress response to regulate the orchestration of the annual cycle when environmental changes occur. To sum up, we show in this review that prolactin regulation has a strong potential to allow ecological physiologists to better understand how individuals adjust their life-history decisions (clutch size, parental behavior, re-nesting, and onset of molt) according to the environmental conditions they encounter and we encourage further research on that topic.  2015 Elsevier Inc."

Future DirectionsStress has a consistent inhibitory effect on reproductive performance in fish of both sexes, but in a smaller subset of conditions can have stimulatory effects. Inhibitory effects include the suppression of ovarian and testicular development, inhibition of ovulation and spawning, and the production of smaller eggs and larvae. Long-term effects on progeny remain largely undescribed. Endocrine effects include the suppression of hypothalamic, pituitary, and gonadal steroid hormones, with the effects on the production of gonadal androgens and estrogens generally being most profound. Understanding the mechanisms by which stress interferes with reproduction is complicated by the fact that stress-modulated hormones can have systemic effects as well as direct effects on the reproductive endocrine system, and experimental paradigms often don't allow distinction between the two. With that caveat, there is evidence for inhibitory effects on reproduction from all levels in the stress endocrine axis but strongest evidence is available for the role of corticosteroids, noting that the dominance of the literature by studies on the effects of cortisol is partly a reflection of the relative ease of measurement of steroid hormones. Proposed mechanisms of action include systemic metabolic effects, genomic glucocorticoid receptor-mediated effects and direct action through nongenomic processes that may include substrate competition for steroid-converting enzymes and binding proteins. The majority of stress studies have involved laboratory assessment of captive or cultured fish populations and there is much less information on the effects of stress among free-living, wild fishes. It is clear that reproductive processes can be maintained over a wide range of corticosteroid concentrations, but there is also increasing evidence that social control of reproduction may be mediated by stress processes. There remains scope for improved understanding of stress-reproduction interactions at all levels of reproductive function.  2016 Elsevier Inc."

Concluding Remarks and the UnknownsIn this chapter we summarize the key patterns observed in the transcript abundances of genes involved in the hypothalamicpituitaryinterrenal (HPI) axis regulation, as well as regulation of stress-responsive genes that are modulated by corticosteroid signaling in fish. Plasma levels of cortisol, the primary corticosteroid in teleosts, rise within minutes after a stressor encounter, and this steroid action is mediated primarily by genomic signaling involving the family of nuclear receptors including the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Specific molecular responses in target tissues associated with activation of these corticosteroid receptors have become apparent by increased use of receptor antagonists and gene knockdown tools. Although molecular adjustments to stress are dependent on species, developmental stage, type, and duration of stressor, overall cortisol action limits energy-demanding processes and enhances energy mobilization and reallocation. Recent work has also underscored the necessity of maternal cortisol and GR signaling as essential for fish development, but the underlying mechanisms are far from clear. While transcript abundance is an excellent indicator of pathway modulation by cortisol, this data by itself lacks physiological relevance unless accompanied by downstream protein and/or metabolite changes. As the field of molecular biology continues to advance, approaches including next-generation sequencing and gene editing tools will allow production of transgenic animals, even in nonmodel fish species, to reveal molecular mechanisms essential for stress adaptation. This fundamental knowledge may have relevance to improving the welfare of the organism in aquaculture and for protecting ecosystem health and biodiversity.  2016 Elsevier Inc."

This primal act was once thought to stem from a basic fact: milk provides the initial source of calories and nutrients for all mammalian young. But it turns out that milk is a much more complicated biochemical cocktail and provides benefits beyond nutrition. In this fascinating book, biologists Michael L. Power and Jay Schulkin reveal this liquid's evolutionary history and show how its ingredients have changed over many millions of years to become a potent elixir. Power and Schulkin walk readers through the early origins of the mammary gland and describe the incredible diversification of milk among the various mammalian lineages. After revealing the roots of lactation, the authors describe the substances that naturally occur in milk and discuss their biological functions. They reveal that mothers pass along numerous biochemical signals to their babies through milk. The authors explain how milk boosts an infant's immune system, affects an infant's metabolism and physiology, and helps inoculate and feed the baby's gut microbiome. Throughout the book, the authors weave in stories from studies of other species, explaining how comparative research sheds light on human lactation. The authors then turn their attention to the fascinating topic of cross-species milk consumption-something only practiced by certain humans who evolved an ability to retain lactase synthesis into adulthood. The first book to discuss milk from a comparative and evolutionary perspective, Power and Schulkin's masterpiece reveals the rich biological story of the common thread that connects all mammals.  2016 Johns Hopkins University Press.

Many studies on sexual selection identify potential targets only within the reproductive fraction of populations. Floaters constitute the non-territorial fraction of the population, according to the usual definitions. Floaters have been identified through exhaustive capture and marking programmes, removal and nest-box addition experiments, extra-pair paternity studies, acoustic marking and genetic studies. The literature shows that floaters may represent a considerable fraction of populations, especially among males. There is no clear evidence that size, condition or testosterone level is necessary for explaining floater status generally. However, the literature suggests that ornament size and expression are involved in territorial exclusion and may be either its cause or one of its consequences. There is some evidence that floaters survive and reproduce less well than territorials, and that changes from floater to territorial status are accompanied by changes in survival and reproductive rates. However, certain male floaters may obtain some reproductive success through extra-pair copulations. The possibility that floating constitutes a successful alternative strategy in some species cannot be excluded, although the current preliminary consensus is that floaters are 'making the best of a bad job'. Floater status may be imposed by limitations in the availability of mates or breeding space resulting in skewed population sex ratios, polygamous mating systems, high population densities and increased demand for specific breeding requirements such as space in colonies or adequate nesting cavities. Predictions concerning the effects of these factors have not been conducted to date. Few studies have been able to clarify the duration of floater status in any population. For short-lived species, floater status in a single breeding season may in fact imply zero lifetime reproductive success. In males, the existence of a considerable fraction of floaters attempting to breed may select for intense territorial behaviour and competitive mate guarding tactics in territory holders and in aggressive extrapair copulation and territory acquisition tactics in floaters. Interference competition from floaters may lead to density-dependent declines in reproductive success. In females, the attempts by floaters to attain breeding opportunities may have contributed to the observed propensities for female prospecting and for female-female aggression and the signalling of female dominance towards other females. Moreover, there may exist selection in females for signalling quality to mates in order to avoid being evicted by rivals. Excluding floaters from the analysis of sexually selected traits may severely affect sexual selection estimates because of biased sampling for large or more intensely expressed ornamentation. The importance of sexual selection may be negated or underestimated when in fact its action on floaters could be maintaining current levels of expression in the territorial fraction. Existing phenotypes should express, in their morphology, physiology and behaviour, the relentless drive through evolutionary time to avoid becoming a floater."

After accounting for variation due to other factors, there can typically be a two to three-fold variation among individual fishes for both standard and maximum metabolic rate (SMR and MMR). This variation is reasonably consistent over time (provided that conditions remain stable), and its underlying causes may be influenced by both genes and developmental conditions. In this paper, current knowledge of the extent and causes of individual variation in SMR, MMR and aerobic scope (AS), collectively its metabolic phenotype, is reviewed and potential links among metabolism, behaviour and performance are described. Intraspecific variation in metabolism has been found to be related to other traits: fishes with a relatively high SMR tend to be more dominant and grow faster in high food environments, but may lose their advantage and are more prone to risk-taking when conditions deteriorate. In contrast to the wide body of research examining links between SMR and behavioural traits, very little work has been directed towards understanding the ecological consequences of individual variation in MMR and AS. Although AS can differ among populations of the same species in response to performance demands, virtually nothing is known about the effects of AS on individual behaviours such as those associated with foraging or predator avoidance. Further, while factors such as food availability, temperature, hypoxia and the fish's social environment are known to alter resting and MMRs in fishes, there is a paucity of studies examining how these effects vary among individuals, and how this variation relates to behaviour. Given the observed links between metabolism and measures of performance, understanding the metabolic responses of individuals to changing environments will be a key area for future research because the environment will have a strong influence on which animals survive predation, become dominant and ultimately have the highest reproductive success. Although current evidence suggests that variation in SMR may be maintained within populations via context-dependent fitness benefits, it is suggested that a more integrative approach is now required to fully understand how the environment can modulate individual performance via effects on metabolic phenotypes encompassing SMR, MMR and AS.  2016 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles."

We used a repeated measures approach, assaying metabolic traits (rate and scope), behaviour and growth to test these predictions in the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata. We found that while individuals varied significantly in their behaviour and growth rate, more risk prone individuals did not grow significantly faster. Furthermore, after accounting for body size there was no support for among-individual variation in metabolic traits. Thus, while personality differences are clearly present in this population, they do not covary with metabolism and the POLS framework is not supported.  2016 Copyright 2016 White, Kells, Wilson."

ConclusionA fish is chased with a net in an aquarium before being captured, scooped out of the water, and placed in a nearby testing arena. Is it stressed? How can we tell? Are our indicators reliable? Quantification of stress in fish has evolved from the initial development of radioimmunoassays to measure cortisol in plasma to the rapidly expanding suite of genome-based assays. Indicators range from the intracellular to whole-animal level. Expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and activity of metabolic enzymes can be paired with straightforward observations of reflexes and survival. Both traditional and emerging indicators have advantages and disadvantages, and their use is tissue- and context-specific. Ecological, biological, and methodological factors must be considered when selecting, measuring, and interpreting stress indicators. Inter- and intraspecific, sex, life stage, and temporal differences in physiological responses to stressors can confound confirmation of a stressed state. Despite numerous types of indicators, our understanding of how absolute levels of indicators relate to stressor severity and recovery to date remains limited. How accurately indicators characterize stress in wild populations naturally exposed to stressors is still an evolving discussion. The integration of research disciplines and involvement of stakeholders and user groups will aid in filling these knowledge gaps, as well as the translation of individual-level indicators to population- and ecosystem-level processes.  2016 Elsevier Inc."

This requires knowledge of how selection acts on physiological traits in nature. Selection studies in the wild allow us to determine how variation in physiology causes variation in fitness, revealing how evolution molds physiology over evolutionary time. Manipulating phenotypes experimentally in a selection study shifts the distribution of trait variation in a population to better explore potential constraints and the adaptive value of physiological traits. There is a large database of selection studies in the wild on a variety of traits, but very few of those are physiological traits. Nevertheless, data available so far suggest that physiological traits, including metabolic rate, thermal physiology, whole-organism performance, and hormone levels, are commonly subjected to directional selection in nature, with stabilizing and disruptive selection less common than predicted if physiological traits are optimized to an environment. Selection studies on manipulated phenotypes, including circulating testosterone and glucocorticoid levels, reinforce this notion, but reveal that trade-offs between survival and reproduction or correlational selection can constrain the evolution of physiology.More studies of selection on physiological traits in nature that quantify multiple traits are necessary to better determine the manner in which physiological traits evolve and whether different types of traits (dynamic performance vs. regulatory) evolve differently.  2016 American Physiological Society."

Androgen hormones in bird eggs have attracted considerable interest in past years, and it is frequently assumed that their concentrations in eggs are shaped by Darwinian selection. Currently, however, the data is scattered over species with very different life-history strategies, environments and selection pressures, making it difficult to draw any firm conclusions as to their functional significance for a given system. I review the evidence available as to the function, variation and potential adaptive value of yolk androgens (testosterone, T and androstenedione, A4) using one well-studied wild bird model system, the European flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca and Ficedula albicollis. These species both show genetic and environmental variation in yolk androgen levels, along with fitness correlations for the female, suggesting the potential for selection. However, variation in yolk T and A4 seem to be differentially affected, suggesting that maternal constraints/costs shape the transfer of the yolk steroids differently. Most of the environmental variation is consistent with the idea of high yolk androgen levels under poor rearing conditions, although the effect sizes in relation to environmental variation are rather small in relation to genetic among-female variation. Importantly, within-clutch patterns too vary in relation to environmental conditions. Yolk androgens seem to have multiple short- and long-term effects on phenotype and behavior importantly, they are also correlated with the fitness of offspring and mothers. However, the effects are often sex-dependent, and not universally beneficial for the offspring. Unfortunately, conclusive data as to the adaptive benefits of clutch mean androgen levels or within clutch-patterns in different environmental conditions is still lacking.  2015 Elsevier Inc."

However, such genomic conflicts can be resolved when independent male and female mechanisms evolve. The existence, extent and consequences of conflict and/or conflict resolution are currently debated. Endocrinological traits like plasma testosterone (T) are suitable test cases, given their important role in mediating correlated traits, plus their opposing sex-specific fitness effects. We compared full-sibling (brother/sister) captive canaries to test for (1) sexually antagonistic selection characterized by contrasting fitness patterns within pairs of relatives, (2) intersexual genetic correlation of plasma T (h2 = 0.410.31) and (3) intralocus sexual conflict over T levels featured by distinct sex-specific fitness optima. We found potential for sexually antagonistic selection, since high fledgling mass was reached by either brothers or sisters, but not by both. We report a positive intersexual correlation for T, as a requirement for intralocus sexual conflict. However, high levels of T were associated with increased female and decreased male fitness (fledgling mass), which contrasts our expectations and challenges the hypothesis of intralocus sexual conflict driven by T. We hypothesize that behavioural and physiological trade-offs differ between sexes when raising offspring, driving T levels towards a state of monomorphism."

An analysis of the behavior of birds nesting with different densities showed that contacts with neighboring broods were less frequent in chicks from more sparsely distributed nests, while aggressive behavior could be observed in these broods earlier and more often than in their peers from the nests located in more densely populated areas. By testing the parent birds using a standard stimulus of territorial behaviora remotely controlled stuffed gullwe found that the hosts of widely spaced nests reacted more aggressively but left the clutches less frequently than their neighbors that nested more densely. On average, the chicks from the sparsely distributed broods grew faster and the daily increment of the skull size of the chicks correlated inversely with the frequency of parental visits. We suppose that in the case of the seasonal decrease of nesting grounds, the offspring of more aggressive young couples nesting in the most sparsely populated areas had an advantage in the development probably due to the maternal influence on the composition of the eggs. According to our data, in the conditions of low-density nesting, the parental influence on the growth of chicks and development of their aggressive behavior prevailed over the possible developing effect of the social experience.  2015, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

Human males tend to have lower digit ratios than females, and individuals with low ratios tend to excel in physical performance, especially in endurance-related sports. Because early limb development is evolutionarily conservative, it has been speculated that these trends should also be visible in other tetrapod vertebrates. However, studies on non-human vertebrates are scant, and their results suggest that sexual dimorphism in digit ratios and the associations with physical performance are much more intricate and taxon-specific than presumed. In this study, we compared digit ratios of two Podarcis lizards among sexes, colour morphs and species. We also tested for associations with three performance characteristics that are of ecological relevance. Both species examined exhibit male-larger sexual dimorphism in digit ratio. 2D:4D, 3D:4D and 2D:3D ratios are tightly correlated within the manus and the pes, but less so between manus and pes. In the colour polymorphic species P. melisellensis, the yellow morph exhibits higher dimorphism than the orange and white morphs. Digit ratios did not correlate with individual performance for sprint speed or endurance, but within males of P. melisellensis, individuals with higher digit ratios correlated positively with head size and bite force. We conclude that digit ratios in lizards deserve attention, because they exhibit sexual dimorphism and correlate with ecologically relevant morphological and performance variables. As lizard species differ widely in mating systems, reproductive mode, habitat use and locomotor behaviour, they seem excellent model animals for studying patterns in digit length ratios.  2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Understanding how the prenatal environment could predispose chicks to express fear-related behaviors is essential in order to propose preventive actions and improve animal welfare. We simulated the consequences of a maternal stress by experimentally enhancing yolk progesterone, testosterone and estradiol concentrations in hen eggs prior to incubation. The chicks from these hormone-treated eggs (H) and from sham embryos (C) that received the vehicle-only were exposed to novel food, novel object and novel environment tests. H chicks approached a novel object significantly faster and were significantly more active in a novel environment than controls, suggesting less fearfulness. Conversely, no effect of the treatment was found in food neophobia tests. Our study highlights a developmental influence of yolk hormones on a specific aspect of neophobia. The results suggest that increased yolk hormone levels modulate specifically the probability of exploring novel environments or novel objects in the environment.  2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

In this study we aimed to investigate how the badge size of male house sparrows (Passer domesticus) is correlated to avian malaria infections as well as to prenatal testosterone exposure, measured as the 2D:4D digit ratio. The rationale behind this study is that the immunosuppressive effect of maternal testosterone deposition combined with the fitness cost imposed by parasites may cause important trade-offs to the development of secondary sexual signals. Methods: Assuming that vector abundance is a key variable associated with infection risk by avian malaria, we caught adult male sparrows from eight different populations in the Camargue, France, four of which were located in a vector-controlled area, and the other four in an untreated area. For each bird we measured its badge size, digit ratio and took blood to determine its infections status. We used PCR to identify the malaria parasite species and strain that caused the infection. Results: Contrary to our expectation, prevalence of disease did not differ across the vector-treatment regions, with around 80 % of birds being infected in both areas, and those infections were caused largely by a single strain, Plasmodium relictum SGS1. Although infected birds had a badge size not significantly different from uninfected males, there was a condition-dependent association between badge size, infection status and maternal testosterone deposition. Conclusions: This study illustrates that the complexity of temporal and ecological dimensions makes the relationships between disease, testosterone-related traits and secondary sexual signals that have been previously reported less general than thought.  2015 Birget and Larcombe."

Results: Between clutches, the level of lysozyme in eggs is positively related to breeding density; while within a clutch, the level of lysozyme is positively related to the laying order. Conclusion: When parents breed under conditions of high density, they allocate more lysozymes to their offspring, a trait adaptive to the local environment.

Common analytical methods (e.g. immunoassays), however, suffer from cross-reaction with other steroids, leading to potential overestimation of CORT concentrations which can obscure true hormone-environment relationships and complicate among-study comparisons. We here apply a new LC-MS/MS technique, which has recently been shown to avoid the problem of cross-reactivity due to its high specificity, to quantify CORT concentrations in yolk and albumen in clutches of lesser black-backed gulls Larus fuscus. We found that CORT concentration exhibited a previously unreported U-shaped relationship with time of breeding, which we explain as a potential interplay of two forces exerting extra strain on the early and late breeders. Furthermore, results showed an increase in CORT with laying order indicating the energetic expense of egg production. The levels of CORT assessed in this study were significantly lower than those previously reported in studies using immunoassays for CORT analysis. This supports the fact that incorporating chromatography effectively reduces overestimation of CORT due to cross-reactivity with other steroid hormones, particularly in egg yolk.  2015 Nordic Society Oikos."

The offspring (litter sizes from 6 to 8)from high body-mass parents(female, 51.5 g1.6 g; male, 60.4 g2.5 g) were defined as parental high group (HBM), and those from low body-mass parents(female, 35.5 g1.2 g; male, 49.6 g 2.8 g) as parental low group(LBM). Body mass and energy intake from age of 4 weeks to 13 weeks, resting metabolic rate (RMR), nonshivering thermogenesis (NST), glucose tolerance, body composition, organ mass, and serum leptin concentration in the adults were recorded. Our results showed that: (1)Gross energy intake and digestible energy intake of offspring in the LBM group were significantly higher than those of the HBM group. The wet and dry masses of testes in the LBM group were significantly lower than those of the HBM group. (2) RMR in the LBM group was significantly higher than that of the HBM group in male offspring. (3)No significant differences in body-mass, NST, serum leptin, and glucose tolerance were detected between these two groups. These results suggest that low parental body-mass resulted in the trade-off between growth and reproduction in male offspring, indicative of the increases in RMR and energy intake but the depression of reproductive organs.  2015, Science Press.

Fish contamination can occur through contact or residence nearby sediments or though dietary exposure. In this study, we analyzed certain physiological traits in unexposed fish (F1) issued from parents (F0) exposed through diet to three PAH mixtures at similar and environmentally relevant concentrations but differing in their compositions. For each mixture, no morphological differences were observed between concentrations. An increase in locomotor activity was observed in larvae issued from fish exposed to the highest concentration of a pyrolytic (PY) mixture. On the contrary, a decrease in locomotor activity was observed in larvae issued from heavy oil mixture (HO). In the case of the third mixture, light oil (LO), a reduction of the diurnal activity was observed during the setup of larval activity. Behavioral disruptions persisted in F1-PY juveniles and in their offspring (F2). Endocrine disruption was analyzed using cyp19a1b:GFP transgenic line and revealed disruptions in PY and LO offspring. Since no PAH metabolites were dosed in larvae, these findings suggest possible underlying mechanisms such as altered parental signaling molecule and/or hormone transferred in the gametes, eventually leading to early imprinting. Taken together, these results indicate that physiological disruptions are observed in offspring of fish exposed to PAH mixtures through diet.  2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

We tested the hypothesis that BPA accumulation in eggs, mimicking maternal transfer, impacts the development and function of the hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). To mimic maternal transfer, oocytes were loaded with 0 (control), 1, 4 and 40ng BPA embryo-1. We measured the temporal changes in whole body cortisol content, transcript levels of corticosteroidogenesis-related genes and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) protein expressions during early development. In addition, trout larvae were subjected to an acute stressor at key developmental stages (at hatch, just prior to first feed and post hatch) and whole body cortisol levels measured to assess the functional integrity of the HPI axis. The developmental profile of whole body cortisol content was altered in the 1 and 40ng BPA groups compared to the control group. Also, the two key rate-limiting steps in steroidogenesis, the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage (P450scc) enzyme transcript levels were disrupted in the larvae originating from BPA accumulated eggs prior to first feed. Whole body GR and MR protein expressions were higher in the 40ng BPA group compared to other groups prior to first feed. Stressor-induced elevation in whole body cortisol levels were evident at 65 days post-fertilization (dpf) and later, but not at 42 dpf in trout larvae. This cortisol response to a stressor exposure was attenuated in the 4 and 40ng BPA groups at 65 dpf, but not at 140 dpf. Together, accumulation of BPA in eggs, mimicking maternal transfer of this chemical, disrupts the ontogeny of cortisol stress response in trout larvae and may compromise the target tissue responsiveness to cortisol stimulation during early development.  2015 Elsevier B.V."

We proposed and tested two hypotheses: (1) the strength of prenatal effects is attenuated by challenging postnatal environments (postnatal override) and (2) the strength of prenatal effects increases with the severity of postnatal challenges (postnatal reveal).We reared commonmurre (Uria aalge) chicks and measured prenatal exposure to corticosterone (CORT) and testosterone (T) from allantoic waste. Adrenocortical function was assessed after 10 d of ad lib. Feeding and then after 5 and 10 d on controlled diets. Postnatal override predicts that prenatal steroids will explain more phenotypic variation before implementation of energy restriction; postnatal reveal predicts that the contribution of prenatal steroids will increase with duration and severity of energy restriction. Energy restriction increased secretion of baseline CORT and the adrenocortical response to the standardized stressor of handling and restraint. The ability of prenatal steroids to explain baseline CORT increased with duration of energy restriction, and for day 20 free baseline CORT, there was a significant interaction between kilojoules per day and prenatal CORT levels; severity of restriction strengthened the relationship between prenatal hormone levels and postnatal hormone levels. Both maximum CORT at day 20 and fledging age were best explained by diet treatment and day 15 or day 20 baseline CORT, respectively. Overall, prenatal CORT increased fledging age and baseline secretion of CORT, while prenatal T decreased them. However, prenatal effects on adrenocortical function were apparent only under the energy restriction conditions. Thus, we found some support for the postnatal reveal hypothesis; our results suggest that some prenatal effects on phenotype may be more likely to manifest in challenging postnatal environments.  2015 by The University of Chicago.

In this study, we tested the effect of a heterospecific rearing environment on individual developmental trajectories of the acoustic structure of nestling begging calls. Fifty-two zebra finch chicks were fostered either to Bengalese finch or to zebra finch parents, and begging calls were recorded at several stages of nestling development. Acoustic analyses revealed that the development of the spectral features of the begging calls differed between experimental conditions: chicks reared by Bengalese finches produced higher pitched and less broadband begging calls than chicks reared by conspecific parents. Differences were stronger in males than females and were not explained by differences in growth rate.

Furthermore, few studies have taken the plasticity of signals into account in viability selection analyses. The relationship between signal expression and survival is of particular interest in melanin-based traits, because their main costs are still debated. Here, we first determined the main factors explaining variability in a melanin-based trait linked to dominance: the bib size of a colonial bird, the sociable weaver Philetairus socius. We then used these analyses to obtain a measure representative of the individual mean expression of bib size. Finally, we used capture-recapture models to study how survival varied in relation to bib size. Variation in bib size was strongly affected by year and moderately affected by age, body condition and colony size. In addition, individuals bearing small and large bibs had higher survival than those with intermediate bibs, and this U-shaped relationship between survival and bib size appeared to be more pronounced in some years than others.

This should result in increased parental investment to individual offspring, as assumed by the model of optimal egg size. The opposite pattern, i.e., stronger dependence of offspring fitness on parental investment and consequently larger parental investment under good conditions is assumed by both the theory of differential allocation if attractive males provide material benefits, and reproductive compensation if they invest less into paternal care. Another influential idea is the Trivers-Willard model, which assumes sexspecific dependence of offspring fitness on parental investment. Here we tested these ideas by examining the effects of egg size on offspring fitness across many postnatal contexts in the Collared Flycatcher Ficedula albicollis. We employed a cross-fostering design that generated variation in egg size within nests and used brood means of fledgling mass as a functional measure of the quality of rearing conditions. Effects of egg size on three offspring traits, including lifetime reproductive success of recruits, were more pronounced in low-quality broods. These results support the assumption of the model of optimal egg size. Based on female preference for males providing material benefits, this pattern could support differential allocation, if attractive males invest less in paternal care, or reproductive compensation, if they invest more. By comparison, we did not find any evidence for sex specificity of fitness returns that might explain sex monomorphism of egg size in this species. The challenge for future studies will be the integration of components of parental investment and offspring fitness into their global measures and testing how the former affects the latter across gradients of postnatal conditions.  2015 by the Ecological Society of America."

Here we investigated whether the melanin-based breast-band of male and female Bar-throated Apalis Apalis thoracica is a signal of information about its bearer and is associated with male and female reproductive effort. Breast-band size was a highly variable morphometric trait in both sexes, but only in males was it associated with body mass. We then assessed whether male and female breast-band size predicted maternal and paternal investment. Egg mass increased with male breast-band size, but decreased with female breast-band size. Whether females adjust maternal hormone allocation in response to their partner's ornamentation remains a contentious issue. We found that yolk testosterone and androstenedione concentrations were not predicted by male ornamentation or body mass. Finally, males with larger breast-bands provided their mates with more food, allowing those females to spend more time incubating. Reproductive effort of both parents is therefore predicted by their own and their mate's ornamentation in Bar-throated Apalis, and thus breast-band size potentially acts as a signal of reproductive performance in both sexes.

However, there have been few studies investigating effects of LSM on early post-hatching phenotype, despite its broad physiological and protective role during embryogenesis. Here, we test how experimentally increased concentrations of egg white LSM affect hatchability in Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) and chick phenotype immediately after hatching (particularly body weight, tarsus length, plasma LSM concentration, and plasma complement activity). Chicks from eggs with increased LSM concentration displayed reduced tarsus length compared to chicks from control eggs while hatchability, body weight and plasma LSM concentration were unaffected. It is worth noting that no effect of increased in ovo lysozyme on eggs hatchability could be related to pathogen-free environment during artificial incubation of experimental eggs causing minimal pressure on embryo viability. While tangible in vivo mechanisms during avian embryogenesis remain to be tested, our study is the first to document experimentally that egg white LSM appears to have growth-regulation role during embryo development, with possible underlying phenotypic consequences in the early post-hatching period in precocial birds.

It is known that during periods of intense intrasexual competition such as initial breeding stages, females are highly aggressive towards intruding females. Here, we studied the implications of T levels for female-female competition by comparing levels of aggressiveness towards simulated female intruders (decoys) in two populations of the pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) with a marked difference in breeding density. To this end, we exposed free-living females to simulated territorial intrusions during 30 min when nest construction was almost complete. T levels of females were measured at the beginning of incubation under the assumption that they are positively associated with T levels during nest building. We also related aggressiveness to T levels in both populations. Furthermore, we aimed at detecting whether variation of T levels may explain female incubation attendance. Females showed higher T levels in the populations where pied flycatchers were exposed to a higher likelihood of conspecific interactions (high breeding density) than in the population with low breeding density. Female territorial presence, vigilance at the nest box and proximity to decoys were negatively related to circulating T levels in the high-density population, but not in the low-density population. Differences in T levels between populations did not result in differences in female incubation attendance, but T levels were negatively related to the incubation attendance in females from the population showing high T levels. In our populations, T levels in females prior to laying reflect the need to defend nesting cavities which is higher at high breeding density and in subdominant females. High T levels are costly in terms of incubation attendance. Copyright  2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH."

When conditions improve birds can accelerate growth, but this compensatory strategy is associated with long-term adverse consequences. One system affected by altered growth rates is the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Here, we subjected European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, to an unpredictable food manipulation from 35 to 115 days of age. We assessed the effects of the treatment by measuring overall body mass and body composition during and following the treatment period (i.e., accelerated growth). In adulthood, we measured the long-term effects of the treatment on overall body mass, testis volume, and HPG axis function in both sexes by quantifying androgen levels before and after a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) challenge. During the treatment period, treatment birds had less body fat than controls. Following the treatment period, treatment birds weighed more than controls, but these gains were attributed to changes in lean mass. In adulthood, treatment males had lower baseline androgen levels, but there was no difference in peak androgen levels compared to controls. Treatment females did not differ from controls on any of the androgen measures. However, females that accelerated growth faster following the termination of the treatment had lower integrated androgen levels. When faced with limited developmental resources, birds may alter the developmental trajectory of physiological systems as a compensatory strategy. Such a strategy may have long-term consequences on endocrine regulation that could affect courtship and reproductive behaviors.  2015 Elsevier Inc."

Across taxa, patterns of sexual dimorphism in digit ratios are ambiguous and a scarcity of studies in basal tetrapods makes it difficult to understand how ratios have evolved. Here, we focus on examining sex differences in digit ratios (2D:3D, 2D:4D, and 3D:4D) in a common amphibian, the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra). We used graphic software to measure soft tissue digit length and digit bone length from X-rays. We found a nonsignificant tendency in males to have a lower 2D:3D than females; however, no sexual differences were detected in the other ratios. We discuss our results in the context of other studies of digit ratios, and how sex determination systems, as well as other factors, might impact patterns of sexual dimorphism, particularly in reptiles and in amphibians. Our findings suggest that caution is needed when using digit ratios as a potential indicator of prenatal hormonal effects in amphibians and highlight the need for more comparative studies to elucidate the evolutionary and genetic mechanisms implicated in sexually dimorphic patterns across taxonomic groups.  2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Among birds, a link between T and female aggression is plausible, as females of many species exhibit a seasonal peak in T concentrations at the onset of breeding when social instability is greatest and they may have circulating T through much of the breeding season. However, investigations examining the relationship between T and female aggression are few and have yielded conflicting results, with experimentally or endogenously elevated T supporting aggressive behaviour in females of some species but not others, and T elevating with aggression at some points of the reproductive cycle but not others. We examined the relationship between endogenous levels of T and female aggression in the northern cardinal, Cardinalis cardinalis, a resident temperate species in which pairs exhibit prolonged territoriality and females have measurable levels of T year-round, including all stages of reproduction (incubation, nestling feeding, etc.). Using simulated nest intrusions, we assessed aggressive responses of incubating females to intrasexual 'intruders' at the nest and quantified T levels after each aggressive encounter. Displays of aggression towards 'intruders' varied among females; yet, individuals showing greater levels of aggression did not demonstrate higher levels of T. These results imply that T might not support maternal aggression in this species.  2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

In many altricial birds, hatching asynchrony creates a sibling competitive hierarchy within the brood, with first-hatched nestlings enjoying substantial advantages compared to last-hatched nestlings. We used this opportunity to test for a trade-off between growth and self-maintenance processes (oxidative stress, telomere erosion) in great tit nestlings, since resource availability and allocation are likely to differ between first-hatched and last-hatched nestlings. We found that despite their starting competitive handicap (i.e. being smaller/lighter before day 16), last-hatched nestlings exhibited growth rate and mass/size at fledging similar to first-hatched ones. However, last-hatched nestlings suffered more in terms of oxidative stress, and ended growth with shorter telomeres than first-hatched ones. Interestingly, growth rate was positively related to plasma antioxidant capacity and early life telomere length (i.e. at 7days old), but among last-hatched nestlings, those exhibiting the faster body size growth were also those exhibiting the greatest telomere erosion. Last-hatched nestlings exhibited elevated levels of plasma testosterone (T), but only at day 7. T levels were positively associated with oxidative damage levels and plasma antioxidant capacity, the latter being only significant for first-hatched nestlings. Our results suggest that last-hatched nestlings present a specific trade-off between growth rate and self-maintenance processes, which is possibly driven by their need to compete with their older siblings and potentially mediated by elevated levels of T.  2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Despite great interest in sensitive windows from both fundamental and applied perspectives, the functional (adaptive) reasons why they have evolved are unclear. Here we outline a conceptual framework for understanding when natural selection should favour changes in plasticity across development. Our approach builds on previous theory on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity, which relates individual and population differences in plasticity to two factors: the degree of uncertainty about the environmental conditions and the extent to which experiences during development ('cues') provide information about those conditions. We argue that systematic variation in these two factors often occurs within the lifetime of a single individual, which will select for developmental changes in plasticity. Of central importance is how informational properties of the environment interact with the life history of the organism. Phenotypes may be more or less sensitive to environmental cues at different points in development because of systematic changes in (i) the frequency of cues, (ii) the informativeness of cues, (iii) the fitness benefits of information and/or (iv) the constraints on plasticity. In relatively stable environments, a sensible null expectation is that plasticity will gradually decline with age as the developing individual gathers information. We review recent models on the evolution of developmental changes in plasticity and explain how they fit into our conceptual framework. Our aim is to encourage an adaptive perspective on sensitive windows in development.  2015 Fawcett et al."

It has been hypothesized that mothers may be able to create a steroid environment that adjusts the phenotypes of offspring to current environmental conditions. Complicating this hypothesis is the potential for developing embryos tomodulate their early endocrine environment. This study utilized the threespined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) to characterize the early endocrine environment within eggs by measuring four steroids (progesterone, testosterone, estradiol, and cortisol) ofmaternal origin.We then examined how the concentrations of these four steroids changed over the first 12 days post fertilization (dpf). Progesterone, testosterone, estradiol, and cortisol of maternal origin could be detected within unfertilized eggs and levels of all four steroids declined in the first 3 days following fertilization. While levels of progesterone, testosterone, and estradiol remained low after the initial decline, levels of cortisol rose again by 8 dpf. These results demonstrate that G. aculeatus embryos begin development in the presence of a number of maternal steroids but levels begin to change quickly following fertilization. This suggests that embryonic processes change the early endocrine environment and hence influence the ability of maternal steroids to affect development. With these findings, G. aculeatus becomes an intriguing system in which to study howselection may act on both maternal and embryonic processes to shape the evolutionary consequence of steroid-mediated maternal effects.  2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Two key adaptations that increase their reproductive success are (1) the capacity for cuckoos to lay large numbers of eggs and thereby parasitize many nests per year, and (2) the ability of cuckoo eggs to hatch before those of hosts, enabling cuckoo nestlings to evict host eggs and eliminate competition for food. Producing more eggs is generally associated with reduced investment of nutrients and energy reserves per egg, which in turn is associated with shorter incubation periods both within and between species. We hypothesized that Common Cuckoos deposit reduced energy reserves into their eggs than do their hosts to facilitate both (1) and (2). To test these hypotheses, we compared the concentration of yolk lipids (per wet yolk mass) between eggs of 3 cuckoo gentes and their respective host species: Great Reed Warblers (Acrocephalus arundinaceus), Common Redstarts (Phoenicurus phoenicurus), and Reed Warblers (A. scirpaceus). Yolk lipids provide the bulk of energy required for embryonic development and can also serve structural and cell-signalling functions. As a general pattern, cuckoo eggs contained a lower concentration of energy-reserve lipids than eggs of their respective hosts, but not structural or cell-signalling lipids. When controlling for their heavier eggs and yolks, Common Cuckoo eggs had an estimated lower amount of energy reserve lipids for their size than host eggs. Our findings suggest a potential role of yolk lipid composition in facilitating (1) and (2) and advocate the need for further research in this area. We also highlight the potential problems of using either concentration or total yolk mass alone to compare maternal investment across taxa in comparative studies."

As the effects of T on females appear to be species-specific, it is not clear if similar effects of high T occur in non-songbird species. Here, we studied the effects of T supplementation on female reproductive behavior and oviposition in the budgerigar, Melopsittacus undulatus, a small monogamous parrot species with distinct sex differences in parental behavior. We experimentally increased T concentrations to male-like levels in T-treated females compared to controls and we allowed females to breed. We found no significant effects of treatment on the latency to enter the nestbox but T treatment significantly interfered with oviposition. Our results show that T-treated females were seven times less likely to produce a clutch than control females. As we found that T treatment had a strong inhibitory effect on oviposition, our results indicate that female budgerigars suffer fitness costs from male-like plasma T levels. Therefore, it may be possible that, also in non-songbird species, selection for higher T levels in males is constrained by a correlated response to selection which imposes fitness costs on females in terms of reproduction. Evaluating whether or not this is indeed the case requires further work combining different approaches to the study of the evolution of male and female testosterone levels.  2015 Current Zoology."

However, theoretical predictions for age effects are contradictory and, to our knowledge, we do not know for any wild animal how the quality of offspring is affected by both parents' ages across their lifespans, or whether mothers' and fathers' ages interact. We tackled this question using long-term data on a highly philopatric, insular population of the blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii). In this species extra-pair paternity is most common in pairs of two young parents or two old parents, implying that these age combinations might prejudice offspring quality. Analysis of the viability of 3,361 offspring of parents up to 21 years old revealed that fledglings with two young parents or two old parents were least likely to become breeders, whereas fledglings with one young parent and one old parent were most likely to do so. For young parents of either sex, offspring viability increased with age of the other parent; for very old parents, it decreased. These effects could be mediated by parents flexibly modifying their investment in offspring in response to their own and their partners ages, but evidence for this was lacking. In 5,343 breeding attempts, although mothers' and fathers' ages independently affected four heavily care-dependent breeding traits at the clutch and nestling stages, their interaction did not affect any trait. The effects of parental age combinations on viability could also be mediated by genes: fledglings with one young parent and one old parent could benefit from greater heterozygosity or better genes.  2015 Drummond, Rodrguez.

Inference in Bayesian animal models is typically based upon Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which are generally flexible but time-consuming. Recently, a new Bayesian computational method, integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA), has been introduced for making fast non-sampling-based Bayesian inference for hierarchical latent Gaussian models. This paper is concerned with the comparison of estimates provided by three representative programs (ASReml, WinBUGS and the R package AnimalINLA) of the corresponding methods (REML, MCMC and INLA), with a view to their applicability for the typical animal breeder. Gaussian and binary as well as simulated data were used to assess the relative efficiency of the methods. Analysis of 2319 records of body weight at 35 days of age from a broiler line suggested a purely additive animal model, in which the heritability estimates ranged from 0.31 to 0.34 for the Gaussian trait and from 0.19 to 0.36 for the binary trait, depending on the estimation method. Although in need of further development, AnimalINLA seems a fast program for Bayesian modeling, particularly suitable for the inference of Gaussian traits, while WinBUGS appeared to successfully accommodate a complicated structure between the random effects. However, ASReml remains the best practical choice for the serious animal breeder.  Author(s) 2015. CC Attribution 3.0 License."

Although their effects on offspring phenotype are often sex-specific, the reason why sometimes sons are more sensitive to prenatal hormone exposure and sometimes daughters is not well understood. Here I combine an experimental manipulation of yolk testosterone concentration in the egg and quantification of selection acting on yolk androgen-sensitive traits in a natural population of great tits (Parus major) with a literature review to test the hypothesis that sex-specific selection on traits affected by yolk androgens determines which sex is more sensitive to prenatal hormone exposure. An experimental increase of the testosterone content in the egg boosted the post-hatching growth of male, but not female great tit nestlings. However, I found no evidence that survival selection on body mass or size is acting differently in the two sexes. A literature review revealed that yolk androgen manipulations affect the growth of males and females differently across species. Interestingly, in studies performed in the wild a significant association between the strength and direction of sexual size dimorphism and sex-specific sensitivities to yolk androgens was observed. In studies performed in captivity, no such relationship was found. Thus, across species there is some evidence that sex-specific selection on body size influences how strongly growth trajectories of males and females are affected by maternally-derived yolk androgens.  2015 Barbara Tschirren.

One important consideration that has been overlooked in previous research is the likely non-linear nature of hormone effects. To examine possible complex dose - response effects of maternal androgens on chick development, we experimentally administered three different androgen doses of the naturally occurring mixture of yolk testosterone and androstenedione to spotless starling eggs (Sturnus unicolor). We found that yolk androgens induce a non-linear dose - response pattern in several traits. Androgens had a stimulatory effect on hatchling body mass and nestling skeletal growth, but maximum values were found at intermediate doses, whereas our highest dose resulted in a decrease. However, the opposite U-shaped effect was found on nestling body mass. We also detected linear negative and positive effects on embryonic development period and nestling gape width, respectively. Our results suggest differential tissue responsiveness to yolk androgens, which may result in compromises in maternal allocation to produce adapted phenotypes. Because of the non-linear dose - response pattern, future investigations should carefully consider a wide range of concentrations, as the balance of costs and benefits may strongly differ depending on concentration.  2015, Company of Biologists Ltd.

The invariant two-egg clutch size of Eudyptes penguins has recently been proposed to be a unique example of a maladaptive phenotypic stability, while their egg mass is a plastic trait. We tested whether this phenotypic plasticity during reproduction might result from constraints imposed by migration (migratory carry-over effect) and breeding (due to the depletion of female body reserves). For the first time, we examined whether these constraints differ between eggs within clutches and between egg components (yolk and albumen). The interval between colony return and clutch initiation positively influenced the yolk mass, the albumen mass, and the subsequent total egg mass of first-laid eggs. This time interval had only a slight negative influence on the yolk mass of second-laid eggs and no influence on their albumen and subsequent total masses. For both eggs, female body mass at laying positively influenced albumen and total egg masses. Female investment into the entire clutch was not related to the time in the colony before laying but increased with female body mass. These novel results suggest that the unique intraclutch egg size dimorphism exhibited in Eudyptes penguins, with first-laid eggs being consistently smaller than second-laid eggs, might be due to a combination of constraints: a migratory carry-over effect on the first-laid egg and a body reserve depletion effect on the second-laid egg. Both these constraints might explain why the timing of reproduction, especially egg formation, is narrow in migratory capital breeders. We examined whether the conflict between migration and reproduction acts on the different egg components (especially yolk and albumen). We showed that the puzzling intra-clutch egg size dimorphism observed in crested penguins is due to a combination of negative constraints on egg production: a migratory carry-over effect on the first-laid egg and a reserve depletion effect on the second-laid egg.  2015 The Authors.

Kentish Plovers Charadrius alexandrinus and Snowy Plovers C. nivosus are closely related wader species that exhibit similar, moderate (c. 4%), male-biased adult SSD.

In one population (Mexico, Snowy Plovers), males and females differed in size from the day of hatching, whereas growth rates differed between the sexes in two populations (Turkey and United Arab Emirates, both Kentish Plovers). In contrast, a fourth population (Cape Verde, Kentish Plovers) showed no significant SSD in juveniles.

We measured body-mass growth and daily energy expenditure (DEE) of free-ranging chicks in the Arctic. We used daily gains in body mass and DEE to estimate daily metabolizable energy (DME, kJ day-1) and total metabolizable energy (TME, kJ chick-1). Chicks gained body mass quickly, with a logistic growth rate constant 57% greater than the allometric prediction, yet were at only 60% of adult body mass at fledging. Males grew at a rate similar to that of females but for a slightly longer duration and so reached an asymptotic body mass 23% greater, and tarsus length 8% longer, than that of females. Chick growth performance was similar between first- and second-hatched chicks within broods of 2, which suggests that food availability was not limited. DEE increased in proportion to body mass, and DME peaked at 1,214 kJ day-1 on day 25 posthatching. Over the average 49-day postnatal period, TME was 49.0 MJ, which is within the range of error of the allometric prediction. Parents provided 58.6 MJ as food to meet this energy requirement. Given this chick energy requirement and the range of energy content of prey observed in the chick diet, selecting prey with higher energy content would greatly reduce adult provisioning effort. Red-throated Loon chicks did not have a high postnatal energy requirement, but rather grew quickly and fledged at a small size-with the effect of reducing the length of the postnatal period and, consequently, parental energy investment in chicks.  2015 American Ornithologists' Union."

Southern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes chrysocome exhibit both a reversed hatching asynchrony and a brood reduction strategy. First-laid (A-)eggs are smaller and hatch on average 1 day after second-laid (B-)eggs, with B-eggs usually producing the only surviving chick. According to the sexual signalling hypothesis, we predicted a positive relationship between BGC and both female body mass and egg mass, and consequently within clutches a stronger BGC in B-eggs than A-eggs. Furthermore, we expected a negative relationship between BGC and clutch initiation date. Contrasting these expectations, we found no effect of female body mass or egg mass on BGC, and BGC in A-eggs increased with clutch initiation date, while there was no effect in B-eggs. Within clutches, A-eggshells were more intensely blue-green coloured than B-eggshells. Concluding, our results appear to contradict the sexual signalling hypothesis. We, however, did not measure pigment concentrations and solely relied on BGC from eggshell photospectrometry, assuming that biliverdin concentrations were positively correlated with BGC. We therefore caution that before precluding the sexual signalling hypothesis, future studies that include measurements of eggshell pigment concentrations in addition to BGC are necessary. Altogether, a better understanding of the biological meaning of biliverdin, its biochemical synthesis and antioxidative function in the avian body is urgently needed.  2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Birds were raised in nests that were either supplemented with food (Fed) or unsupplemented (Unfed). Fledging success was higher in Fed compared with Unfed nests. After accounting for hatching rank, growth and oceanic conditions at fledging, Fed fledglings had a lower probability of recruiting as breeders in the Middleton colony than Unfed birds. The per-nest contribution of breeders was still significantly higher for Fed nests because of their higher productivity. Lifetime reproductive success of a subset of kittiwakes that thus far had completed their life cycle was not affected by the food supplementation during development.

Of particular interest is how glucocorticoids (GCs) in eggs, as a signal of maternal stress, affect offspring behavioural traits. To date, research has focused on effects of egg GCs on offspring behaviours within a single experimental context. Little is known regarding how egg GCs affect relationships among behaviours and across ecological contexts (i.e. behavioural syndromes). We explored how exogenously increased egg cortisol shapes behavioural syndromes of juvenile coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch. Social dominance during a territory intrusion and boldness following a simulated predator attack were recorded for juvenile coho salmon reared from cortisol-treated and untreated eggs. When exposed to a conspecific intruder, coho salmon treated with cortisol in ovo increased dominance behaviours, whereas coho salmon reared from untreated eggs reduced these behaviours. Following exposure to a simulated predator attack, coho salmon reared from cortisol-treated eggs increased boldness (i.e. increased activity and feeding; reduced shelter use), whereas coho salmon reared from untreated eggs reduced boldness. A dominance-boldness relationship was observed for coho salmon reared from cortisol-treated, but not untreated, eggs; dominance during the territory intrusion positively correlated with boldness under threat of predation. Our results highlight the complex influence of egg GCs on offspring behaviour and behavioural syndromes. Continued investigation into the outcomes of egg GCs on offspring will broaden our understanding of intergenerational components of the hormone-behaviour nexus.  2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

However, the components and mechanisms of increased parental investment following immunostimulation are currently unknown. We hypothesize that increased glucocorticoid production following immunostimulation modulates the increase in reproductive effort that constitutes terminal investment. We activated the immune system of breeding female house wrens (Troglodytes aedon) with an immunogen and cross-fostered the eggs that they subsequently produced to separate prenatal and postnatal components of maternal investment. Cross-fostering revealed an increase in both pre- and postnatal allocation from immunostimulated females, which was confirmed by quantification of egg constituents and maternal provisioning behavior. The increase in maternal provisioning was mediated, at least in part, by increased corticosterone in these females. Offspring immune responsiveness was also enhanced through transgenerational immune priming via the egg. Thus, our results indicate that maternal immunostimulation induces transgenerational effects on offspring through both pre- and postnatal parental effects and support an important role for corticosterone in mediating parental investment.  2015 by The University of Chicago.

Oxidative stress occurs in living organisms when reactive oxygen species remain unquenched by antioxidant defense systems and become detrimental to cells. In fish, it is unknown how maternal oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity influence offspring quality. The semelparous, migratory life history of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) provides a unique opportunity to explore intergenerational effects of oxidative stress. This study examined the effects of population origin on maternal and developing offspring oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity, and elucidated intergenerational relationships among populations of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) with varying migration effort. For three geographically distinct populations of Fraser River sockeye salmon (British Columbia, Canada), antioxidant capacity and oxidative stress were measured in adult female plasma, heart, brain, and liver, as well as in developing offspring until time of emergence. Maternal and offspring oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity varied among populations but patterns were not consistent across tissue/developmental stage. Furthermore, maternal oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity did not affect offspring oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity across any of the developmental stages or populations sampled. Our results revealed that offspring develop their endogenous antioxidant systems at varying rates across populations; however, this variability is overcome by the time of emergence. While offspring may be relying on maternally derived antioxidants in the initial stages of development, they rapidly develop their own antioxidant systems (mainly glutathione) during later stages of development.  2015 Elsevier Inc."

Egg weights and egg quality were measured daily. Corticosterone treatment resulted in a remarkable increase in feed intake and sharp decrease in egg production compared with control (p<0.05) whereas body weight remained unchanged. Decreased albumen height, but no changes in egg weight, led to decreased Haugh unit (p<0.05). Corticosterone caused elevated eggshell thickness (p<0.05) without altering weight and strength, suggesting possible changes in shell structure. Yolk color and redness were increased by corticosterone (p<0.05) but lightness and yellowness were either not changed or inconsistent over the time period of measurements. Increased concentrations in plasma were also found for corticosterone, glucose, cholesterol, creatinine, uric acid, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, total protein, and amylase (p<0.05), suggesting that corticosterone increased protein breakdown, renal dysfunctions and pancreatitis. Together, the current results imply that dietary corticosterone affects egg quality such as yolk colors and shell thickness, in addition to its effects on feed intake and egg production.

In addition, covariation of lateralization with position in the laying sequence, which is expected because the concentration of maternal egg hormones varies with laying order, has never been investigated. We analyzed lateralization of yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) chicks in reverting from supine to prone posture ('RTP' response) and in pecking at a dummy parental bill to solicit food provisioning ('begging' response). Chicks were lateralized both at the population and at the individual level in the RTP response and at the individual level in begging. Lateralization in the RTP was sex-dependent, as females showed a leftward preference. Lateralization in either motor task was not correlated within individuals. Lateralization did not differ among families, suggesting little additive genetic variation. Lateral preference in begging response varied according to laying order and matched variation in egg androgens concentration. Our study confirms previous findings on population-level lateralization and adds to the scant information on individual-level and heritable variation in lateralization in birds. Moreover, it hints at epigenetic components in lateralization depending on maternal effects.  2015 ."

This paradox has motivated the search for mechanisms that might maintain a populations adaptive potential. Mothers make many contributions to the attributes of their developing offspring and these maternal effects can influence responses to natural selection if maternal effects are themselves heritable. Maternal genetic effects (MGEs) on fitness might, therefore, represent an underappreciated source of adaptive potential in wild populations. Here we used two decades of data from a pedigreed wild population of North American red squirrels to show that MGEs on offspring fitness increased the populations evolvability by over two orders of magnitude relative to expectations from direct genetic effects alone. MGEs are predicted to maintain more variation than direct genetic effects in the face of selection, but we also found evidence of maternal effect trade-offs. Mothers that raised high-fitness offspring in one environment raised low-fitness offspring in another environment. Such a fitness trade-off is expected to maintain maternal genetic variation in fitness, which provided additional capacity for adaptive evolution beyond that provided by direct genetic effects on fitness.  2015 The Authors."

Using the swordtail fish Xiphophorus multilineatus, we looked at the effects of maternal investment and social environment during development on the formation of a behavioural syndrome. A previous study demonstrated that the diet on which mothers were reared, controlling for their size, influenced the growth rate and size of their sons: females reared on high-quality diets had sons that grew faster and were larger at sexual maturity. In addition, males that were exposed to an adult male during development grew faster. We examined the behaviours of these same males across two contexts: aggression towards a mirror image and boldness under threat of predation. We detected an influence of maternal investment but not of social environment on the formation of a behavioural syndrome. The sons of mothers reared on high-quality diets exhibited a positive correlation between boldness and aggression, while there was no correlation among the sons of mothers reared on low-quality diets. Maternal investment influenced the formation of the syndrome by producing changes in only one of the behaviours, the behaviour most closely linked to energy acquisition (boldness under risk of predation) rather than energy expenditure (aggression). Our results suggest that energy balances could help predict the circumstances that would favour the formation of behavioural syndromes. Our results also support the hypothesis that behaviours involved in energy acquisition as compared to energy use will be more sensitive to fluctuations in variation in resources.  2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

Female guppies were exposed to routine husbandry procedures that produced only a minimal, non-significant, elevation of the stress hormone cortisol. In contrast to controls, offspring from mothers that experienced this mild stress failed to learn to associate a colour cue and food reward, and showed a greater amount of inter-individual variation in behaviour compared with control offspring. This mild stress also resulted in offspring that were more aggressive towards their own mirror image than controls. While it is possible that these results could represent the transmission of beneficial maternal characteristics to offspring born into unpredictable environments, the potential for mild maternal stress to affect offspring performance also has important implications for research into the trans-generational effects of stress.  2015 Elsevier Inc."

Differential allocation of maternal resources, in terms of egg weight and yolk composition, may therefore allow the female to adjust brood reduction and to fine-tune reproductive investment in accordance with the expected fitness returns. The adaptive value of such maternal resource allocation is thought to be context-dependent as well as species-specific. We investigated the effects of female preference for her mate on the allocation of prenatal maternal resources in the budgerigar, Melopsittacus undulatus, a monogamous species of parrot that shows an extreme hatching asynchrony. We assessed mate preferences in a two-way preference test and allowed females two breeding rounds: one with the preferred and one with the non-preferred partner. We found no effect of preference on either latency to lay or clutch size, but females mated with the preferred partner laid eggs that contained significantly more yolk. Their eggs also contained significantly more androstenedione but not testosterone. Our results suggest that in this species, female preference may influence maternal resource allocation, and that the functional roles of each androgen in the yolk should be considered separately. In addition, we found a significant effect of laying order on egg and yolk weight as well as on yolk testosterone and androstenedione levels. These measures, however, did not change linearly with the laying order and render it unlikely that female budgerigars compensate for the extreme hatching asynchrony by adjusting within-clutch allocation of prenatal maternal resources.  2015 Elsevier Inc.."

The relative plasticity hypothesis (RPH) predicts that switches between plastic ARTs are mediated by changes in steroid hormones. This has received much support in males, but little is known about the endocrine control of female ARTs. Here, using a free-living population of African striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio) over five breeding seasons, we tested whether females following different tactics differed in corticosterone and testosterone levels, as reported for male striped mice using ARTs, and in progesterone and oestrogen, which are important in female reproduction. Female striped mice employ three ARTs: communal breeders give birth in a shared nest and provide alloparental care, returners leave the group temporarily to give birth, and solitary breeders leave to give birth and do not return. We expected communal breeders and returners to have higher corticosterone, owing to the social stress of group-living, and lower testosterone than solitary breeders, which must defend territories alone. Solitary breeders had lower corticosterone than returners and communal breeders, as predicted, but testosterone and progesterone did not differ between ARTs. Oestrogen levels were higher in returners (measured before leaving the group) than in communal and solitary breeders, consistent with a modulatory role. Our study demonstrates hormonal differences between females following (or about to follow) different tactics, and provides the first support for the RPH in females.  2015 Elsevier Inc."

Reproductive activities may lead to high production of pro-oxidants, whose activity can generate oxidative damage when not countered by adequate antioxidant defenses. Because inter-individual differences in the efficiency of the antioxidant system are influenced by an individuals diet, food availability experienced during reproduction may affect the females antioxidant status and, in birds, their ability to transfer antioxidants into their eggs. Moreover, a females ability to cope with oxidative stress has been suggested to influence pigment deposition in the eggshell, suggesting a possible signaling function of eggshell maculation. Here we performed a food supplementation experiment in a natural population of great tits (Parus major) in order to investigate how nutritional conditions experienced during the egg laying period affect the females oxidative status and egg investment and how maternal oxidative status and egg antioxidant protection relate to eggshell pigmentation. We show that food-supplemented females had lower oxidative damage levels (ROMs) than non-food-supplemented females. Furthermore, a females ROMs levels were negatively associated with the levels of yolk antioxidant protection in her eggs, but this negative association was only significant in non-food-supplemented females. This suggests that oxidative stress experienced during reproduction influences the allocation of antioxidants into the eggs. Moreover, we observed a positive relationship between eggshell pigment distribution and maternal and yolk antioxidant protection, suggesting that eggshell pigmentation is a cue of female (and offspring) quality.  2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Existing theoretical work on carer investment rules has, however, largely focused on biparental care, and on modelling offspring provisioning in isolation from other stages of investment. Consequently, there has been little exploration of how maternal investment prior to birth might be expected to influence carer provisioning decisions after birth, and how these should be modified by the number of carers present. In particular, it is unclear whether mothers should increase or decrease their investment in each offspring under favourable rearing conditions, and whether this differs under alternative assumptions about the consequences of being 'high quality' at birth. We develop a game-theoretical model of cooperative care that incorporates female control of prebirth investment, and allow increased maternal investment to either substitute for later investment (giving offspring a 'head start') or raise the value of later investment (a 'silver spoon'). We show that mothers reduce prebirth investment under better rearing conditions (more helpers) when investment is substitutable, leading to concealed helper effects. In contrast, when maternal prebirth investment primes offspring to benefit more from postbirth care, mothers should take advantage of good care environments by investing more in offspring both before and after birth. These results provide novel mechanisms to explain contrasting patterns of maternal investment across cooperative breeders.  2015."

The social environment is part of the prenatal environment; however, its influence on maternal allocation has been poorly investigated and experimental tests linking prenatal conditions to begging behaviour have seldom been conducted. In cooperative breeders the presence of additional carers, the helpers, generally predicts an increase in provisioning during the nestling stage. Since begging is costly, in these species producing offspring that beg less in the presence of helpers may be a way of saving energy not only for the offspring but also for the future survival and reproduction of females. To date, whether mothers may manipulate begging behaviour in relation to helper presence is unstudied. We conducted a cross-fostering experiment in a cooperatively breeding bird, the sociable weaver, Philetairus socius, to disentangle the possible effects of prenatal and postnatal environments on begging behaviour. Pre- and postnatal environments correspond here to the number of carers in the nest of origin and the foster nest, respectively. As predicted, begging was influenced by the prenatal environment, with nestlings originally from larger groups begging less. In addition, chicks fed by more foster birds also begged at a lower rate. We conclude that the prenatal environment influences begging behaviour. This result has important implications for understanding cooperative breeding strategies since producing offspring that beg less with more helpers may allow energy savings for females and related offspring and helpers.  2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

In a recent study, yolks of great tit (Parus major) eggs were directly supplemented with carotenoids, and the effects on offspring fitness proxies measured (Marri and Richner in Oecologia 176:371377, 2014a).

While these steroids can influence development, embryonic enzymes are thought to buffer some steroid sensitive processes, such as gonadal differentiation, from the effects of maternal steroids. Many of these same enzymes may also buffer the embryo from chemicals present in the environment, but this may alter their capacity to metabolize maternal steroids. Here, we characterized the ability of red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta) embryos to metabolize oestrone immediately following oviposition and tested whether a prevalent environmental chemical, Bisphenol A (BPA), would affect the in ovo conversion of oestrone to oestrone sulfate. We found that tritiated oestrone applied at the time of oviposition is mostly converted to oestrone sulfate within 6 h. However, when BPA is present, that conversion is inhibited, resulting in elevated oestrone levels. Our finding of rapid in ovo metabolism of steroids suggests that maternally derived enzymes are present in the egg and can alter embryonic exposure to exogenous chemicals. The disruption of this metabolism by BPA demonstrates how environmental chemicals might change embryonic exposure to endogenous substances within the egg. Taken together, these findings highlight the dynamic nature of the early endocrine environment in developing vertebrates.  2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved."

The adult offspring were fed high-fat diet for 8. weeks, and body weight and food intake were measured. No difference was observed in litter size, litter mass or pup mass before weaning. Maternal protein supplement increased body mass and the mass of reproductive organ but decreased digestibility and fat deposition and alleviated HFD-induced obesity especially in the males. Glucose tolerance was elevated in the offspring from maternal protein supplement, especially in the females. The accelerated growth may be associated with high serum leptin concentration at weaning, a state of leptin resistance, and the low digestibility may predispose obesity resistance especially in male offspring from maternal high-protein diet.

In this review, we will predominantly focus on BPA and EE2, well-described estrogenic EDCs. First, the evidence that BPA and EE2 are detectable in almost all bodies of water will be discussed. We will consider how BPA affects sexual and neural development in these species, as these effects have been the best characterized across taxa. For instance, such chemicals have been in many cases reported to cause sex-reversal of males to females. Even if these chemicals do not overtly alter the gonadal sex, there are indications that several EDCs might demasculinize male-specific behaviors that are essential for attracting a mate. In so doing, these chemicals may reduce the likelihood that these males reproduce. If exposed males do reproduce, the concern is that they will then be passing on compromised genetic fitness to their offspring and transmitting potential transgenerational effects through their sperm epigenome. We will thus consider how diverse epigenetic changes might be a unifying mechanism of how BPA and EE2 disrupt several processes across species. Such changes might also serve as universal species diagnostic biomarkers of BPA and other EDCs exposure.

Feather samples were taken from sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus, kestrel Falco tinnunculus, buzzard Buteo buteo, barn owl Tyto alba, and tawny owl Strix aluco and the variation in feather CORT concentrations with respect to species, age, sex, feather position, and body condition was assessed. In sparrowhawks only, variation in feather CORT content was compared with hepatic metal concentrations. For individuals, CORT concentration (pgmm-1) in adjacent primary flight feathers (P5 and P6), and left and right wing primaries (P5), was statistically indistinguishable. The lowest concentrations of CORT were found in sparrowhawk feathers and CORT concentrations did not vary systematically with age or sex for any species. Significant relationships between feather CORT content and condition were observed in only tawny owl and kestrel. In sparrowhawks, feather CORT concentration was found to be positively related to the hepatic concentrations of five metals (Cd, Mn, Co, Cu, Mo) and the metalloid As. There was also a negative relationship between measures of condition and total hepatic metal concentration in males. The results suggest that some factors affecting CORT uptake by feathers remain to be resolved but feather CORT content from archived specimens has the potential to provide a simple effects biomarker for exposure to environmental contaminants.  2015 Elsevier Inc."

A physiological model for clutch size determination (CSD), involving an anti-gonadal effect of prolactin (PRL) via suppression of luteinizing hormone (LH), was proposed over 20. years ago, but has received scant experimental attention since. The few studies looking at a PRL-based mechanistic hypothesis for CSD have been equivocal, but recent experiments utilizing a pharmacological agent to manipulate PRL in the zebra finch (. Taeniopygia guttata) found no support for a role of this hormone in clutch size determination. Here, we take a complementary approach by manipulating clutch size through egg removal, examining co-variation in PRL and LH between two breeding attempts, as well as through experimentally-extended laying. Clutch size increased for egg removal females, but not controls, but this was not correlated with changes in PRL or LH. There were also no differences in PRL between egg removal females and controls, nor did PRL levels during early, mid- or late-laying of supra-normal clutches predict clutch size. By uncoupling PRL, LH and clutch size in our study, several key predictions of the PRL-based mechanistic model for CSD were not supported. However, a positive correlation between PRL levels late in laying and days relative to the last egg (clutch completion) provides an alternative explanation for the equivocal results surrounding the conventional PRL-based physiological model for CSD. We suggest that females coordinate PRL-mediated incubation onset with clutch completion to minimize hatching asynchrony and sibling hierarchy, a behavior that is amplified in females laying larger clutches.  2015 Elsevier Inc."

Sex ratios at birth were estimated from the adult sex ratio, and after applying a correction in which all dead/missing individuals were counted as the rarer sex (males). Before correction the overall population sex ratio was female biased during both years, with over 42% of mothers producing clutches that were significantly different from unity. After correction, 25% (2013) to 33% (2011) of mothers still produced significantly biased sex ratios. The ratio of deaths of males to females had to be 1.75 to 1 (2011) and 7.25 to 1 (2013) for sex ratios not to be biased at birth. There was no evidence of sex reversal in any individual from juvenile (C4 stage) to adult, implying that juvenile sex ratios were also significantly biased. Hence, neither sex reversal nor differential mortality of the sexes is a likely explanation for the observed skewed sex ratios. The sex ratios at birth varied widely from the expectation from Mendelian inheritance of sex chromosomes, suggesting that another mechanism is responsible for skewed sex ratios at birth. Since the majority of families with biased sex ratios at birth were female dominated as adults, biased sex ratio at birth may contribute to the skewed sex ratio of adults observed in the field.  2015 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography"

In this work, we aimed to describe C. dimerus social structure and its association with hormonal profiles and testicular cellular composition. We recorded and quantified agonistic interactions from the territorial pair, i.e. the top ranked male and female, and the lowest ranked male of stable social groups. Plasma levels of 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT), testosterone, 17-estradiol (E2) and cortisol were measured by ELISA. Results show that territorial pairs cooperatively guarded the territory, but rarely attacked in synchrony. Territorial males had higher testosterone and 11-KT plasma levels than non-territorial males, while E2 and an index of its metabolization from testosterone were higher in non-territorial males. No difference was observed in cortisol levels. Plasma 11-KT and an index of the conversion of testosterone to 11-KT, positively correlated with the frequency of aggressiveness, while E2 showed the opposite pattern. Territorial males had a higher gonadosomatic index than non-territorial males. The quantification of testicular cellular types revealed that the percentage of spermatocytes and spermatids was higher in non-territorial males, while territorial males showed a greater percentage of spermatozoa.

An adverse outcome pathway (AOP) is a concept that provides a framework for organizing knowledge about the progression of toxicity events across scales of biological organization that lead to adverse outcomes relevant for risk assessment. In this paper, we focus on exploring how the AOP concept can be used to guide research aimed at improving both our understanding of chronic toxicity, including delayed toxicity as well as epigenetic and transgenerational effects of chemicals, and our ability to predict adverse outcomes. A better understanding of the influence of subtle toxicity on individual and population fitness would support a broader integration of sublethal endpoints into risk assessment frameworks. Detailed mechanistic knowledge would facilitate the development of alternative testing methods as well as help prioritize higher tier toxicity testing. We argue that targeted development of AOPs supports both of these aspects by promoting the elucidation of molecular mechanisms and their contribution to relevant toxicity outcomes across biological scales. We further discuss information requirements and challenges in application of AOPs for chemical- and site-specific risk assessment and for extrapolation across species. We provide recommendations for potential extension of the AOP framework to incorporate information on exposure, toxicokinetics and situation-specific ecological contexts, and discuss common interfaces that can be employed to couple AOPs with computational modeling approaches and with evolutionary life history theory. The extended AOP framework can serve as a venue for integration of knowledge derived from various sources, including empirical data as well as molecular, quantitative and evolutionary-based models describing species responses to toxicants. This will allow a more efficient application of AOP knowledge for quantitative chemical- and site-specific risk assessment as well as for extrapolation across species in the future.  2014 The Authors."

Innate constitutive immunity was assessed using bacterial killing assays (BKA) against two bacterial species: Escherichia coli and Providencia rettgeri, whereby the latter causes considerable economic loss to industry from septicaemic mortalities. Although the bactericidal capabilities were different at approximately 4. months old (32. . 3% for E. coli and 16. . 4% for P. rettgeri), the differences had disappeared by approximately 9. months old (58. . 2% and 68. . 6%, respectively).

A possible, but as yet unexplored, function of olfaction and chemical communication in birds is in parent-embryo and embryo-embryo communication. Communication between parents and developing embryos may act to mediate parental behaviour, while communication between embryos can control the synchronicity of hatching. Embryonic vocalisations and vibrations have been implicated as a means of communication during the later stages of development but in the early stages, before embryos are capable of independent movement and vocalisation, this is not possible. Here we show that volatiles emitted from developing eggs of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) convey information on egg fertility, along with the sex and developmental status of the embryo. Specifically, egg volatiles changed over the course of incubation, differed between fertile and infertile eggs, and were predictive of embryo sex as early as day 1 of incubation. Egg odours therefore have the potential to facilitate parent-embryo and embryo-embryo interactions by allowing the assessment of key measures of embryonic development long before this is possible through other modalities. It also opens up the intriguing possibility that parents may be able to glean further relevant information from egg volatiles, such as the health, viability and heritage of embryos. By determining information conveyed by egg-derived volatiles, we hope to stimulate further investigation into the ecological role of egg odours.  2015 Webster et al."

While the evolutionary consequences of such nongenetic inheritance are increasingly well understood, less is known about how inheritance mechanisms evolve. Here, we present a simple but versatile model to explore the adaptive evolution of non-genetic inheritance. Our model is based on a switch mechanism that produces alternative phenotypes in response to different inputs, including genes and non-genetic factors transmitted from parents and the environment experienced during development. This framework shows how genetic and non-genetic inheritance mechanisms and environmental conditions can act as cues by carrying correlational information about future selective conditions. Differential use of these cues is manifested as different degrees of genetic, parental or environmental morph determination. We use this framework to evaluate the conditions favouring non-genetic inheritance, as opposed to genetic determination of phenotype or within-generation plasticity, by applying it to two putative examples of adaptive non-genetic inheritance: maternal effects on seed germination in plants and transgenerational phase shift in desert locusts. Our simulation models show how the adaptive value of non-genetic inheritance depends on its mechanism, the pace of environmental change, and life history characteristics.

Individuals often experience variation in resource availability during growth and development, and resource allocation trade-offs are common. However, very little is known about the mechanisms underlying such trade-. Oxidative stress may provide a proximate link between investment in growth and/or reproduction (primary and secondary sexual traits) and self-maintenance. The trade-off between investment in growth/reproduction and oxidative stress is modulated by antioxidant defenses. Such trade-offs can be particularly acute for strongly sexually-selected species, where significant investment in costly secondary sexual characteristics can only be achieved at a cost to other traits, and in species that feed dependent young, where there are expected to be trade-offs associated with conflict over provision of parental investment. In this review we examine the life-history consequences of these trade-offs during (the critical period of early) growth and development, and consider the potential role of oxidative stress as a causal link between life-history and signal evolution. In particular we discuss how availability of dietary antioxidants, through affecting the oxidative status of individuals, alters the relationship between the early social and nutritional environment experienced by individuals (involving strategic signaling among family members) and the expression of phenotypic traits during adulthood (signaling quality to prospective mates or competitors).  2015 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

When food resources provided by the parents are insufficient to rear a whole litter successfully, dominants may kill their subordinate siblings, either directly by physical damage, or indirectly through enforced starvation. This phenomenon is termed ""facultative siblicide"" and occurs in a wide range of bird species and at least one mammalian species. In contrast, when the lowest ranking sibling is routinely killed by its dominant brood mate or littermate this is called ""obligate siblicide"", and seems to affect in particular large, long-lived species characterized by intense competition for breeding sites. This ""obligate siblicide"" has intrigued researchers for decades, trying to find an evolutionarily satisfactory explanation for this extreme behaviour. We review all scientific literature concerning sibling aggression published in the last 66 years. A bibliography search resulted in 104 references during the last 66 years, where birds represented 88% of the total published papers. Eleven hypotheses have been formulated for explaining these results, finding that siblicide is a complicated behaviour not controlled only for parents or chicks or environmental changes, but for a whole range of factors. These hypotheses have been identified and discussed according to actual supporting data. The relationship between food resources and brood reduction was widely documented; a sustained increase in food availability led to a highly significant decrease in both frequency and intensity of aggressiveness of the older chick towards its younger sibling in facultative species, also finding similar results in obligate siblicidal species. These results would suggest siblicide is an adaptive behaviour. This review tends to show that there is probably more than a single cause behind this behaviour. We conclude that more aspects must be considered in the design of future studies in order to understand the potential evolutionary sense of aggressive behaviour among siblings, especially those concerning food allocation decisions by parents.  2014 Dipartimento di Biologia, Universit di Firenze, Italia."

Current theory posits that such conflicts may influence the evolution of parental allocation as well as reproductive modes. While energy allocation to the offspring has received considerable attention, the distribution of water - another potentially limited vital resource to both the mother and offspring - and the resulting outcomes remain grossly understudied. Here, we explored the intergenerational trade-off related to water resources in the viviparous aspic viper (Vipera aspis) by examining the effects of water deprivation on female physiology (body mass, haematocrit and osmolality), water transfer to developing embryos and reproductive performance. As a result of water deprivation, females became dehydrated, with the effects more pronounced in pregnant compared to nonreproductive females. Among pregnant females, the impacts of water deprivation on water balance were correlated with fecundity. In contrast, water deprivation had no effect on water transfer to the offspring or on reproductive performance. Our results demonstrate that, under water-constraining conditions, female water balance is compromised in favour of the developing embryos, highlighting a significant intergenerational trade-off for water. Although ectothermic reptiles are particularly tolerant in water balance perturbations, our results suggest that, like energy, water can be a conflicting resource between mother and offspring. Parent-offspring conflict over water should therefore be further investigated to better understand reproductive modes and reproductive trade-offs in terrestrial organisms.  2014 The Authors."

We hypothesized that, under homogeneous incubation conditions, the differences documented among clutches would be attributable to familial effects, caused by either heritable genetic factors or preovulatory maternal effects. Eggs were incubated artificially at the pivotal temperature for the species (33.4C) and hatchlings were reared in the laboratory for 2 mo. Two eggs from each clutch were tested for testosterone and 17-estradiol levels. Sex ratios, hatchling size, mass, and righting times varied both between clutches within a site and between populations. Egg mass was positively related to hatchling body size and mass, both at hatching and at 2 mo of age. Levels of 17-estradiol concentrations influenced hatching success rates and incubation periods. Sex ratios were marginally related to 17-estradiol levels, with clutches and sites with higher levels tending to produce fewer males. Our results provide evidence that preovulatory maternal effects play a role in influencing phenotypic attributes related to hatchling survivorship such as size, growth rate, and performance, and also seem to interact with incubation temperature to determine the sex of each individual and the sex ratio of the clutch, which has implications for both parental and offspring fitness.  2015 by The Herpetologists' League, Inc."

Such 'maternal' effects are often mediated by the size and quality of the eggs in terms of maternal endogenous substances or exogenous components. Maternal effects can function to maximize parental fitness via adaptive allocation of components among sibling eggs. In birds, the often documented variation in concentration of egg dietary antioxidants or other egg compounds with laying order may thus reflect adaptive parental favouritism or maternal physiological constraints. Vitamins are found in the yolk at high concentrations and accomplish important physiological functions. Tocopherols ('vitamin E') have major roles in antioxidant protection, but the consequence of variation in their concentration for chick phenotype has never been experimentally investigated under a natural selection regime. In the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) free-ranging population we studied, vitamin E concentration and egg size decline from the first to the third (last) egg. Chicks from third eggs are smaller and have lower viability compared to those from sibling eggs. Here, we tested the effect of injecting a physiological dose of vitamin E in the egg yolk on chick body size at hatching by comparison with chicks from sham-injected eggs. As predicted, chicks from vitamin E injected third eggs were larger than chicks from control third eggs, whereas vitamin E had no effect on chicks from the other eggs. Thus, vitamin E injection disrupted the brood size hierarchy according to laying order normally found in this species. In species that adopt a brood reduction strategy, differential allocation of vitamin E to the eggs can contribute to establish a hierarchy of reproductive value among progeny members functioning to maximize parental fitness. The present results therefore have general implications for the study of the evolution of maternal effects mediated by transfer of potentially limiting maternal antioxidants to the eggs.  2015 British Ecological Society."

The balance between costs and benefits of androgen allocation is expected to depend on nestling environment. We tested this hypothesis in a multibrooded passerine, the spotless starling, Sturnus unicolor. We experimentally manipulated yolk androgen levels using a between-brood design and evaluated its effects on nestling development, survival and immune function. Both in first and replacement broods, the embryonic development period was shorter for androgen-treated chicks than controls, but there were no differences in second broods. In replacement broods, androgen-treated chicks were heavier and larger than those hatched from control eggs, but this effect was not observed in the other breeding attempts. Androgen exposure reduced survival with respect to controls only in second broods. Regarding immune function, we detected nonsignificant trends for androgen treatment to activate two important components of innate and adaptive immunity (IL-6 and Ig-A levels, respectively). Similarly, androgen-treated chicks showed greater lymphocyte proliferation than controls in the first brood and an opposite trend in the second brood.

However, what (most) birds need to time with the seasonal peak of food availability is the moment of maximum food demand of their nestlings, which is more tightly related with hatching date than with laying date. After initiating egg laying, birds still have some opportunities to adjust the time of highest food demand, as during the several days elapsed between laying of the first egg until hatching, more precise cues will become available to birds in order to make a more accurate match with food availability. I provide an overview of the suite of mechanisms available to birds for shortening or enlarging the interval between laying and hatching date, which include laying gaps, adjustment of clutch size, variation in onset and intensity of incubation, and differential investment on eggs. Then I illustrate with an example the extent to which birds can adjust hatching dates after egg laying. I argue that birds should more accurately time hatching date rather than laying date to maximum food availability on the basis of available cues. Therefore, I suggest that researchers should target on hatching date rather than laying date to better study optimal timing of reproduction in birds. Exploration of responses other than adjusting laying date to changing environmental conditions will surely uncover key aspects of avian reproductive biology and behaviour that have been ignored until now. This is a necessary step towards a better understanding of capacities of organisms to adapt to a changing world in particular, and of fitness consequences of timing of reproduction in general.  2014 The Author."

One ubiquitous form of provisioning is in the makeup of egg. However, only a few studies examine the role of specific egg constituents in maternal effects, especially as they relate to maternal selection (a standardized selection gradient reflecting the covariance between maternal traits and offspring fitness). Here, we report on the evolutionary consequences of differences in maternal acquisition and allocation of amino acids to eggs. We manipulated acquisition by varying maternal diet (milkweed or sunflower) in the large milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus. Variation in allocation was detected by examining two source populations with different evolutionary histories and life-history response to sunflower as food. We measured amino acids composition in eggs in this 2  2 design and found significant effects of source population and maternal diet on egg and nymph mass and of source population, maternal diet, and their interaction on amino acid composition of eggs. We measured significant linear and quadratic maternal selection on offspring mass associated with variation in amino acid allocation. Visualizing the performance surface along the major axes of nonlinear selection and plotting the mean amino acid profile of eggs from each treatment onto the surface revealed a saddle-shaped fitness surface. While maternal selection appears to have influenced how females allocate amino acids, this maternal effect did not evolve equally in the two populations. Furthermore, none of the population means coincided with peak performance. Thus, we found that the composition of free amino acids in eggs was due to variation in both acquisition and allocation, which had significant fitness effects and created selection. However, although there can be an evolutionary response to novel food resources, females may be constrained from reaching phenotypic optima with regard to allocation of free amino acids.  2015 The Authors.

In constant environments, we show that maternal effects evolve to slight negative values that result in a reduction of the phenotypic variance (canalization). By contrast, in populations experiencing abrupt change, maternal effects transiently evolve to positive values for many generations, facilitating the transmission of beneficial maternal phenotypes to offspring. In periodically fluctuating environments, maternal effects evolve according to the autocorrelation between maternal and offspring environments, favoring positive maternal effects when change is slow, and negative maternal effects when change is rapid. Generally, the strongest maternal effects occur for traits that experience very strong selection and for which plasticity is severely constrained. By contrast, for traits experiencing weak selection, phenotypic plasticity enhances the evolutionary scope of maternal effects, although maternal effects attain much smaller values throughout. As weak selection is common, finding substantial maternal influences on offspring phenotypes may be more challenging than anticipated.  2015 The Author(s)."

In some reptiles, gonadal outcome is regulated by temperature during a critical period of the embryonic development. Gonadal steroid hormones are seen as effectors of the gonadal differentiation process. Recently, stress and glucocorticoids (GCs), stress-related hormones in vertebrates, have been considered as potential modulators of the sex determination process in some vertebrates that present temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). In reptiles, corticosterone is the main GC produced, and its administration to eggs causes a bias in sex ratio in some lizards. In this context, we aim at assessing whether dexamethasone (Dex), a potent synthetic glucocorticoid, can modify the sex ratio in Caiman latirostris, a species with strong TSD. As a first step, we incubated embryos at masculinizing temperatures (33C; 100% males). Different doses of Dex were topically applied to the eggshell at stage 20, prior to gonadal differentiation. We assessed embryonic development at stages 22 and 25 and evaluated some physiological and morphological hatchling traits. Embryonic mortality was not affected by dexamethasone manipulation. No effects of Dex on sex ratio were found and all animals analyzed histologically possessed testes. However, older embryos and hatchlings from Dex treated eggs were heavier, larger, and hatched earlier than control individuals. Our results do not account for Dex involvement in the process of ovarian differentiation, at least under a strong masculinizing temperature. Nevertheless, they suggest that Dex might accelerate embryo development by enhancing intermediate metabolism and/or by stimulating growth hormone secretion.  2015 Brazilian Society of Herpetology."

Such covariation may arise due to maternal effects, rendering this relationship particularly sensitive to environmental conditions. Here, we manipulated the social environment by pairing females with either their chosen or non-chosen male. Subsequently, all clutches were cross-fostered to separate pre- and postnatal effects. We found a positive covariation between offspring begging and parental provisioning, which was, however, unaffected by mate preferences, and we found no evidence for differential allocation. In addition, there was no effect of assortative mating, which is thought to reinforce parent-offspring covariation. The fact that parent-offspring covariation is consistently observed in canaries suggests that it is biologically relevant, but it requires further studies to elucidate its sensitivity to environmental variation.  2015 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden."

In birds, environmental stress during early development is often related to hatching asynchrony; differences in age, and thus size, impose a gradient in conditions ranging from benign (first hatched chick) to harsh (last hatched chick). Here, we compared the effect of hatching order on growth rate in inbred (parents are full siblings) and outbred (parents are unrelated) canary chicks (Serinus canaria). We found that inbreeding depression was more severe under more stressful conditions, being most evident in later hatched chicks. Thus, consideration of inbreeding-environment interactions is of vital importance for our understanding of the biological significance of inbreeding depression and hatching asynchrony. The latter is particularly relevant given that hatching asynchrony is a widespread phenomenon, occurring in many bird species. The exact causes of the observed inbreeding-environment interaction are as yet unknown, but may be related to a decrease in maternal investment in egg contents with laying position (i.e. prehatching environment), or to performance of the chicks during sibling competition and/or their resilience to food shortage (i.e. posthatching environment).  2015 The Author(s)."

Quantifying the relative influence of genetic and environmental variation on phenotype allows evolutionary biologists to make predictions about the potential for a given trait to respond to selection and various aspects of environmental variation. In particular, the environment individuals experience during early development can have lasting effects on phenotype later in life. Here, we used a natural full-sib/half-sib design as well as within-individual longitudinal analyses to examine genetic and various environmental influences on plumage color. We find that variation in melanin-based plumage color - a trait known to influence mating success in adult North American barn swallows (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster) - is influenced by both genetics and aspects of the developmental environment, including variation due to the maternal phenotype and the nest environment. Within individuals, nestling color is predictive of adult color. Accordingly, these early environmental influences are relevant to the sexually selected plumage color variation in adults. Early environmental conditions appear to have important lifelong implications for individual reproductive performance through sexual signal development in barn swallows. Our results indicate that feather color variation conveys information about developmental conditions and maternal care alleles to potential mates in North American barn swallows. Melanin-based colors are used for sexual signaling in many organisms, and our study suggests that these signals may be more sensitive to environmental variation than previously thought.  2015 The Authors.

For mammals, mother's milk is an important physiological pathway for nutrient transfer and glucocorticoid signaling that potentially influences offspring growth and behavioral phenotype. Glucocorticoids in mother's milk have been associated with offspring behavioral phenotype in several mammals, but studies have been handicapped by not simultaneously evaluating milk energy density and yield. This is problematic as milk glucocorticoids and nutrients likely have simultaneous effects on offspring phenotype. We investigated mother's milk and infant temperament and growth in a cohort of rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) mother-infant dyads at the California National Primate Research Center (N = 108). Glucocorticoids in mother's milk, independent of available milk energy, predicted a more Nervous, less Confident temperament in both sons and daughters. We additionally found sex differences in the windows of sensitivity and the magnitude of sensitivity to maternalorigin glucocorticoids. Lower parity mothers produced milk with higher cortisol concentrations. Lastly, higher cortisol concentrations in milk were associated with greater infant weight gain across time. Taken together, these results suggest that mothers with fewer somatic resources, even in captivity, may be ""programming"" through cortisol signaling, behaviorally cautious offspring that prioritize growth. Glucocorticoids ingested through milk may importantly contribute to the assimilation of available milk energy, development of temperament, and orchestrate, in part, the allocation of maternal milk energy between growth and behavioral phenotype.

Domestication offers an interesting framework of rapid evolutionary changes caused by welldefined selection pressures. Behaviour is an important phenotype in this context, as it represents the primary means of response to environmental challenges. An overview is provided of the evidence for genetic involvement in behavioural control and the presently used methods for finding so-called behaviour genes. This shows that evolutionary changes in behaviour are to a large extent correlated to changes in patterns of gene expression, which brings epigenetics into the focus. This area is concerned with the mechanisms controlling the timing and extent of gene expression, and a lot of focus has been placed on methylation of cytosine in promoter regions, usually associated with genetic downregulation. The review considers the available evidence that environmental input, for example stress, can modify methylation and other epigenetic marks and subsequently affect behaviour. Furthermore, several studies are reviewed, demonstrating that acquired epigenetic modifications can be inherited and cause trans-generational behaviour changes. In conclusion, epigenetics may signify a new paradigm in this respect, as it shows that genomic modifications can be caused by environmental signals, and random mutations in DNA sequence are therefore not the only sources of heritable genetic variation.  2015.

We reviewed emerging research that has used GC manipulations in wild vertebrates to assess GC-mediated effects on survival, physiology, behaviour, reproduction and offspring quality. Within and across taxa, exogenous manipulation of GCs increased, decreased or had no effect on traits examined in the reviewed studies. The notable diversity in responses to GC manipulation could be associated with variation in experimental methods, inherent differences among species, morphs, sexes and age classes, and the ecological conditions in which responses were measured. In their current form, results from experimental studies may be applied to animal conservation on a case-bycase basis in contexts such as threshold-based management. We discuss ways to integrate mechanistic explanations for changes in animal abundance in altered environments with functional applications that inform conservation practitioners of which species and traits may be most responsive to environmental change or human disturbance. Experimental GC manipulation holds promise for determining mechanisms underlying fitness impairment and population declines. Future work in this area should examine multiple life-history traits, with consideration of individual variation and, most importantly, validation of GC manipulations within naturally occurring and physiologically relevant ranges.

We video-taped natural broods and examined the effects of experimental feeding in this behaviour. Experimentally fed chicks stopped calling and received fewer feedings. Among un-fed chicks, absence calls were more frequent in smaller nestlings. We found a positive relationship between nestling reaction time to parental arrival and food acquisition: chicks that reacted first received more feedings that slower chicks.

In this chapter, I review studies that have identified potential mechanisms of escape behavior transmission, from estimates of heritability of escape behavior and other quantitative genetic parameters, to family-, population-, and species-level effects on escape that are suggestive of heritability and local adaptation, to specific maternal effect mechanisms that organize escape behavior. This review provides an overview of the current state of the field, with discusion of how escape behavior may become adaptively integrated phenotypically with other components of an animals biology, including morphology, life-history, and reproductive strategies. This chapter is intended as a foundation for further research directions and to identify the largest gaps in what is currently known. As predator-prey regimes are altered by human influences on the environment, it is becoming increasingly critical to determine whether and how prey animals will continue to optimize escape decisions. Understanding the evolvability of escape behavior is a critical component of this endeavor. Predation imposes strong natural selection on individuals and populations of most animal species, resulting in evolution of antipredator traits that facilitate survival. Escape behavior is a particularly interesting component of any animal's antipredator syndrome (i.e., the animal's suite of traits that together facilitate survival against predation) because escape often represents the last line of defense. For example, most animals' antipredator syndromes comprise multiple predator-avoidance traits, such as altered activity patterns, cryptic or warning coloration and behavior, vigilance, defensive nest construction, or chemical defenses. However, for many individuals, these predator avoidance mechanisms at some point ultimately fail to prevent the prey animal from being targeted by a predator for attack (Pinheiro 1996).

New Zealand's kakapo (Strigops habroptilus) is a critically endangered, flightless parrot that now survives only on islands free of introduced predators. The recent population bottleneck of 51 individuals, lek mating system (where only females care for eggs and young) and the fact that all but one of the population's founders came from the same insular population, render them particularly susceptible to inbreeding depression. The present study uses 25 microsatellite loci to derive estimates of relatedness to investigate heterozygosity-fitness correlations in kakapo. After accounting for the effects of co-variables, there was no evidence that male heterozygosity affected variation in egg fertility, but there was evidence that female heterozygosity affected fecundity (i.e. clutch size) and hatching success; that is, more homozygous females lay smaller clutches and had lower hatching success.

In many species, the amount of parental care received is expected to have differing effects on the fitness of males and females. When this occurs, the TWM predicts that selection should favour adjustment of the offspring sex ratio in relation to the expected fitness return from offspring. However, evidence for sex-by-environment effects is mixed, and little is known about the adaptive significance of producing either sex. Here, we test whether offspring sex ratios vary according to predictions of the TWM in the house wren (Troglodytes aedon, Vieillot). We also test the assumption of a sex-by-environment effect on offspring using two experiments, one in which we manipulated age differences among nestlings within broods, and another in which we held nestling age constant but manipulated brood size. As predicted, females with high investment ability overproduced sons relative to those with lower ability. Males were also overproduced early within breeding seasons. In our experiments, the body mass of sons was more strongly affected by the sibling-competitive environment and resource availability than that of daughters: males grew heavier than females when reared in good conditions but were lighter than females when in poor conditions. Parents rearing broods with 1:1 sex ratios were more productive than parents rearing broods biased more strongly towards sons or daughters, suggesting that selection favours the production of mixed-sex broods. However, differences in the condition of offspring as neonates persisted to adulthood, and their reproductive success as adults varied with the body mass of sons, but not daughters, prior to independence from parental care. Thus, selection should favour slight but predictable variations in the sex ratio in relation to the quality of offspring that parents are able to produce. Offspring sex interacts with the neonatal environment to influence offspring fitness, thus favouring sex-ratio adjustment by parents. However, increased sensitivity of males to environmental conditions, such as sibling rivalry and resource availability, reduces the fitness returns from highly male-biased broods.  2014 British Ecological Society."

We conducted a long-term study by experimentally increasing the amount of green plants in nests of a wild population of spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor). We experimentally decoupled the natural carrying behavior of males in half of the population and explored the consequences of this manipulation on offspring condition and their rate of local recruitment. Treatment did not affect the number of fledglings, but it did affect body mass and tarsus in a sexually antagonistic way: a positive effect on female tarsus length and negative on male body mass.

The speed of microevolutionary adaptation may critically be enhanced by between-individual differences in phenotypic plasticity. However, such betweenindividual differences have rarely been shown, especially for long-lived and migratory species that appear particularly vulnerable to phenological shifts. Southern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome are migratory, long-lived seabirds with a 'vulnerable' conservation status. We studied clutch initiation date (CID) and investment into egg mass in individually marked females in response to broad-scale and local climate variables across 7 yr. We thereby distinguished within-individual and between-individual variation and tested the existence of between-individual differences in the expression of phenotypic plasticity. Because of both within-individual and between-individual variation, CID was significantly advanced under high Southern Annular Mode (SAM), reflecting colder environmental conditions and higher food availability. Total clutch mass increased under low local sea surface temperatures (significant withinindividual effect) but was mostly accounted for by female identity. Intra-clutch egg-mass dimorphism was not affected by environmental variables at all. We found no indication of be tween-individual differences in phenotypic plasticity and overall, the expression of phenotypic plasticity appeared to be limited. This raises the question whether between-individual differences in phenotypic plasticity exist in other long-lived species and whether rockhopper penguins show sufficient phenotypic plasticity to adapt to predicted climate changes.

The resulting elevation of circulating corticosterone (the predominant avian ""stress hormone"") promotes highly adaptive physiological and behavioral changes aimed at coping with stress, redirecting the individual into a survival mode while suppressing non-essential activities. However, corticosterone is also required at low levels in the circulation for basic physiological processes, and it plays a fundamental role in the regulation of body energy balance regardless of exposure to stress. Furthermore, high and prolonged elevations like those occurring during chronic adverse conditions exert deleterious effects on critical body systems. The ambiguity of the concept of stress, and the fact that the same hormone exerts opposing (""good and bad"") actions depending on its level, has led to the recent development of novel conceptual frameworks. These are aimed at integrating the energy requirements of birds across their lifecycles with the adrenocortical response, and also at explaining the role of corticosterone in ""allostasis"", the maintenance of homeostasis through change, a term gradually replacing the word ""stress"". The Allostasis Model and the Reactive Scope Model are recent paradigms to understand allostasis in wild animals, with a vast potential for testable predictions in wild birds. The two models will be explained in the first section of this chapter, with an updated classification of the nomenclature describing corticosterone levels and actions. Avian endocrine and behavioral responses are dramatically different when facing predictable versus unpredictable environmental change (also called perturbations or stressors). Why, when, and how environmental conditions promote an activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis will be addressed in a second section, providing an updated classification of the types of perturbations. This classification takes into account the duration of the unpredictable stimuli, the associated adrenocortical response, and the resulting effects on the normal progression of an individual's lifecycles. Avian lifecycles can be temporarily or permanently disrupted in response to perturbations. Although short-term elevations of circulating corticosterone activate a highly adaptive ""emergency life history stage"", longer exposures disrupt lifecycles, potentially leading to individual deaths and population extinction. However, the adrenocortical response shows all the features of a trait subjected to natural selection (high individual variation, repeatability, and a genetic basis), and individuals display a strong phenotypic plasticity that may allow differential survival of stress-tolerant individuals. Several examples of the adaptive variability in the adrenocortical response will be provided in a third section. For example, avian developmental modes range across a spectrum of altricial and precocial species, and the adrenocortical response at hatching and during growth increases across this gradient. This pattern has likely evolved to balance the costs and benefits of corticosterone actions with the ability of young birds to cope with perturbations without parental support. Corticosterone can be also transferred from mothers to offspring. This process has been termed ""maternal programming"", and has the potential to translate ecological and environmental conditions into permanent offspring responses, resulting in phenotypes better adapted to cope with perturbations. Adult birds of many avian species have been shown to modulate their adrenocortical response during reproduction and according to the value of their brood. These findings suggest that modulation of corticosterone secretion allows a trade-off of energy and resources between current reproductive investment and survival, providing a proximate (corticosterone-mediated) mechanism for life history evolution. Many of these findings and hypotheses result from field research using wild avian species, which imposes important challenges compared to laboratory studies. These will be addressed in the last section, with a description of common methodological tools for assessing adrenocortical function in wild birds.  2015, 2000 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Although previous avian experiments suggest that competitive disadvantage may accelerate telomere attrition, they do not clearly isolate the effects of competitive disadvantage from other sources of variation. Here, we present data from an experiment in European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) that used cross-fostering to expose siblings to divergent early experience. Birds were assigned either to competitive advantage (being larger than their brood competitors) or competitive disadvantage (being smaller than their brood competitors) between days 3 and 12 posthatching. Disadvantage did not affect weight gain, but it increased telomere attrition, leading to shorter telomere length in disadvantaged birds by day 12. There were no effects of disadvantage on oxidative damage as measured by plasma lipid peroxidation. We thus found strong evidence that early-life competitive disadvantage can accelerate telomere loss.

Conversely, the CORT stress response was not markedly affected by physiological condition. It was stronger in wild than in domesticated birds and it increased with age. Birds subjected to prenatal unpredictable food supply exhibited an accelerated development of the CORT stress response which could reflect an adaptive maternal effect. We conclude that the vital role of baseline CORT may allow little adaptive scope since changes can quickly become detrimental. In contrast, the CORT stress response may show considerable adaptive potential which might ultimately support homeostasis in a changing environment.  2014 Elsevier Inc."

The explanation is fully general: it is not specific to any particular type of sexual preferences, nor to any species or population. It shows how different sexual preferences can appear in any large group-living population in which sexual selection is sufficiently strong in each sex. The main idea is that the lack of interest toward a member of the opposite sex may be interpreted as a signal of popularity, and thus of reproductive success. It is then boosted by the Fisher runaway process far beyond the point where it becomes costly, resulting in a generalized trait-lack of interest toward the opposite sex. If the interest diverts toward other targets then different sexual preferences emerge. This hypothesis is placed into the context of other works on different sexual preferences in animals; supporting evidence from the literature is reviewed and additional research needed to confirm or refute the hypothesis in any given species is outlined.  2015 Ryabko and Reznikova."

These ""hormone mimics"" that have adverse effects are termed endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). These EDCs emanate from a variety of sources, often being developed for specific needs, such as those used as pesticides, herbicides, or industrial and domestic applications. The characteristics of EDCs differ vastly in terms of life-cycle in the environment, chemical and pharmacological characteristics of the parent compounds and their metabolites, and even in physiological target(s). In birds, the potential for adverse effects of EDCs was first realized with the thinning of eggs in bald eagles, with a dramatic in loss of viable chicks and population level impact. However, effects from exposure to EDCs in birds can be highly variable, with differences associated with species sensitivity, timing of exposure, extent of exposure, and reproductive strategies; precocial species are extremely vulnerable during embryonic development whereas altricial species appear to remain more transiently sensitive throughout their lifetime. The primary endocrine systems impacted by EDCs are the reproductive, thyroid, and stress axes. However, there are a number of other physiological impacts observed in metabolic, cardiac, and immune systems as well as hematological effects associated with some chemicals. Domestic and wild birds come in contact with a vast array of these chemicals in their environment, and both are often exposed to complex combinations. The interactions of EDCs with endocrine systems occur through a variety of mechanisms, including binding to receptors, interference with enzyme systems, modulation of transmitters, and impacting growth factors. Because of unique characteristics of birds, it is important to consider both toxicological and endocrine effects, as many of these EDCs have toxicological effects at higher exposures. Predictive tools to predict risk have focused on activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in comparison to the known effect of dioxin. A more recent approach produces an Adverse Outcomes Pathway, which provides an effective framework to encompass mechanisms through to ecological impacts. Major classes of EDCs will be reviewed in this chapter, along with specific effects on birds in the context of vulnerable species, breeding strategies, and lifetime effects of exposure to EDCs.  2015, 2000 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we examine whether the Australian jacky dragon lizard, Amphibolurus muricatus, can compensate for reduced basking opportunity by basking with greater intensity, and how the thermal environment influences reproductive success in females. Overall, there was no compelling evidence for compensatory thermoregulatory behaviour in response to reduced basking opportunity. Moreover, females with reduced thermal opportunities did not produce eggs, although reproductive success was quite low for both groups, so additional factors may have limited reproduction in the colony. This study allows insight into the links between climate and population persistence in wild animals by providing crucial and rare data on how thermal environment impacts reproduction in an egg-laying lizard.  2015 CSIRO."

The primary role of its secretory products is to regulate energy flow and partitioning. Catecholamines from the chromaffin tissue largely raise blood glucose for rapid energy expenditure during acute stress, especially during the more commonly described ""fight-or-flight"" response. By contrast, the corticosteroid secretory products from the cortical tissue control more complex functions. The mineralocorticoids are part of a larger system that regulates salt and water balance. The glucocorticoids are part of a larger system that regulates energy flow and partitioning, especially blood glucose. The effects of corticosteroids are mediated by a complex array of cognate intracellular and membrane receptors and receptor isoforms. In addition, the action of glucocorticoids at the cellular level is modulated by various circulating binding globulins and intracellular enzymes in target cells that degrade and regenerate active corticosteroids at the local level.

After removal of wet manure from the deep pit, atmospheric ammonia in the deep pit house decreased to 259 ppm compared to 214 ppm in the flushwaste house. Elevated atmospheric ammonia in the deep pit house caused the hens, compared to hens in the flush-waste house, to increase significantly (p<0.05) their serum corticosterone from mid-January through February followed by a decrease until June when it increased again in response to high summer temperatures. Serum progesterone and estradiol-17 in those hens in the deep pit house decreased significantly (p<0.05) in response to elevated atmospheric ammonia. Egg production of hens in the deep pit house was decreased from mid-January through February (p<0.05) followed by a slight rebound in March. Overall egg production remained lower in the deep pit house compared to production in the flush-waste house through July. Elevated atmospheric ammonia is a strong stressor, which will induce increased serum corticosterone that leads to loss of egg production associated with decreased serum concentrations of serum estradiol-17 and progesterone.

Thus, I reviewed over 120 published studies linking variation in haemoglobin concentrations to different measures of condition and other phenotypic or ecological traits. In most of the studied avian species, haemoglobin concentrations were positively correlated with other commonly used indices of condition, such as body mass and fat loads, as well as with quality of the diet. Also, chick haemoglobin concentrations reliably reflected the intensity of nest infestation by parasitic arthropods, and haemoglobin was suggested to reflect parasitism by haematophagous ectoparasites much more precisely than haematocrit. There was also some evidence for the negative effect of helminths on haemoglobin levels in adult birds. Finally, haemoglobin concentrations were found to correlate with such fitness-related traits as timing of arrival at breeding grounds, timing of breeding, egg size, developmental stability and habitat quality, although these relationships were not always consistent between species. In consequence, I recommend the total blood haemoglobin concentration as a relatively robust indicator of physiological condition in birds, although this parameter is also strongly affected by age, season and the process of moult. Thus, researchers are advised to control fully for these confounding effects while using haemoglobin concentrations as a proxy of physiological condition in both experimental and field studies on birds.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of AR mRNA and protein in the pituitary and adrenal glands, to localize AR protein in luteinizing hormone (LH)-producing pituitary and adrenocortical cells, to determine plasma concentrations of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone and the concentrations of corticosterone, testosterone (T), androstenedione (A4) and oestradiol (E2) in the adrenal glands of male turkeys at the age of 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 28weeks. The concentrations of hormones and the expression of AR varied during development. The expression of AR mRNA and protein in pituitary increased during the growth. The increase of AR mRNA levels in pituitary occurred earlier than increase of AR protein. The percentage of pituitary cells expressing ARs in the population of LH-secreting cells increased in week 20. It suggests that AR expression in LH-producing pituitary cells is determined by the phase of development. The drop in adrenal AR mRNA and protein expression was accompanied by an increase in the concentrations of adrenal androgens. Those results could point to the presence of a compensatory mechanism that enables turkeys to avoid the potentially detrimental effects of high androgen concentrations.

On the other hand, cells isolated from developing animals also undergo symmetry breaking in the absence of signaling cues. These spontaneously arising asymmetries are not well understood. However, an ever growing body of evidence suggests that these asymmetries can originate from spontaneous symmetry breaking and self-organization of molecular assemblies into polarized entities on mesoscopic scales.

In vertebrates, one solution to this challenge is to link the expression of shared traits to sex steroids. However, even 'male-biased' steroids such as testosterone (T) circulate at biologically significant levels in females, raising the question of whether sexual dimorphism evolves not only through the coupling of trait expression to T in males, but also through the decoupling of trait expression from T in females. We tested these alternatives by asking whether male and female brown anoles (Anolis sagrei) respond to exogenous T in similar fashion with respect to a suite of sexually dimorphic traits: growth, skeletal morphology, resting metabolism, fat storage, dewlap size and dewlap colour. First, we established the ontogeny of sexual dimorphism in a colony raised in a laboratory common garden. Next, we treated juveniles of each sex with either T implants or empty implants at 5-8 months of age, when sexual dimorphism first began to develop for most traits. T stimulated growth in both sexes and largely abolished natural sex differences in growth. This effect was associated with the stimulation of resting metabolism and the diversion of energy from fat and liver stores in both sexes. T also enlarged the dewlap in both sexes, though females never developed dewlaps equal in size to those of males. Finally, T altered the brightness and saturation of the dewlap in both sexes, inducing coloration similar to that of adult males. Female brown anoles retain many of the same tissue-specific responses to T that occur in males, suggesting that the evolution of androgen-mediated sexual dimorphism has been achieved largely through the coupling of trait expression to sex differences in circulating T, without an associated decoupling of trait expression from T in females.  2014 British Ecological Society."

Oviparity represents the ancestral form of reproduction in all archosaurs, and it is the only form of reproduction utilized by birds. Whereas all modern crocodilians have two functional ovaries, only the left ovary is functional in the majority of avian species. Significantly, avian fossils from two species of an extinct lineage (enantiornithine birds of the Early Cretaceous period) have revealed that these ancestors possessed a single, functional left ovary. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the loss of one ovary to reduce body weight occurred early in avian evolution, perhaps even preceding the capacity for true flight. Interestingly, viviparity has evolved nearly 100 times within the reptilian lineage that includes lizards and snakes; thus, it is unclear why there is no incidence of viviparity within the avian lineage. One line of reasoning is that because extant birds are endothermic and can precisely control the process of egg incubation and embryo development, there may be no thermoregulatory advantage to viviparity in birds.  2015, 2000 Elsevier Inc.

However, renesting also increases reproductive effort to replace lost clutches. We investigated the consequences of this increased reproductive effort by determining whether renesting in female indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea) is associated with a decline in body condition (size-corrected mass) and haematocrit and an increase in stress hormones and whether renesting or maternal body condition is associated with a decline in productivity (clutch size, nestling body condition). Next, because a consequence of multiple renesting attempts is a prolonged breeding season and later timing, we predicted that a population of post-breeding females and juveniles would have lower body condition in fragmented forest than in contiguous forest owing to higher nest predation and frequency of renesting. Both forest types were settled by females of similar condition. Nest survival was lower in fragmented forest, where a higher proportion of females failed their first attempt and the breeding season was 2 weeks longer. Compared with females on their first attempt, renesting females had lower body condition and haematocrit and higher corticosterone concentrations. Lower maternal body condition was associated with higher concentrations of corticosterone, lower nestling body condition and smaller clutches. Clutch size was lower in renests and in fragmented forest. Nestling condition was lower in renests but did not vary greatly with forest type. Despite a prolonged breeding season in the fragmented forest, post-breeding females and hatch-year birds were in similar condition in both forest types. Our results suggest that the indirect effects of nest predation on maternal and offspring condition pose additional individual-level costs that have not been considered in the context of fragmentation studies. We discuss how predator-induced renesting could have additional demographic consequences by prolonging the breeding season and prompting seasonal interactions or carry-over effects that could impact populations.

Over more than 4000 birds, the annual sex ratio at fledging was highly variable (ranging from 44.4% to 58.3% of males), and on average slightly biased towards males (51.6%). Yearly variation in sex-ratio bias was neither related to density within the colony, nor to global or local oceanographic conditions known to affect both the productivity and accessibility of penguin foraging areas. However, rising sea surface temperature coincided with an increase in fledging sex-ratio variability. Fledging sex ratio was also correlated with difference in body condition between male and female fledglings. When more males were produced in a given year, their body condition was higher (and reciprocally), suggesting that parents might adopt a sex-biased allocation strategy depending on yearly environmental conditions and/or that the effect of environmental parameters on chick condition and survival may be sex-dependent. The initial bias in sex ratio observed at the juvenile stage tended to return to 1:1 equilibrium upon first breeding attempts, as would be expected from Fisher's classic theory of offspring sex-ratio variation."

However, when the cost/benefit ratio for producing males versus females differs, the theory predicts that parents may bias production, typically through underproduction of the sex with greater variation in fitness. We tested theoretical predictions in the red-necked phalarope, a polyandrous shorebird with sex-role reversal. Since females are larger and therefore potentially more expensive to produce and may have greater variation in reproductive success, we predicted from Fishers hypothesis a male bias in population embryonic sex ratio, and from sex allocation theory, female biases in the clutches of females allocating more resources to reproduction. We measured eggs and chicks and sexed 535 offspring from 163 clutches laid over 6years at two sites in Alaska. The embryonic sex ratio of 51.1 M:48.9 F did not vary from parity. Clutch sex ratio (% male) was positively correlated with clutch mean egg size, opposite to our prediction. Within clutches, however, egg size did not differ by sex. Male phalarope fitness may be more variable than previously thought, and/or differential investment in eggs may affect the within-sex fitness of males more than females. Eggs producing males were less dense than those producing females, possibly indicating they contained more yolk relative to albumen. Albumen contributes to chick structural size, while yolk supports survivorship after hatch. Sex-specific chick growth strategies may affect egg size and allocation patterns by female phalaropes and other birds.  2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

We set out to uncover endocrine correlates of mate choice, social environment, and reproductive investment in female red-backed fairy-wrens Malurus melanocephalus. In this socially monogamous, yet highly sexually promiscuous species, females experience discrete variation in the phenotype of their mates, which vary in both plumage signals and level of paternal care, and in the composition of their breeding groups, which consist of either the pair alone or with an additional cooperative auxiliary; female investment varies according to these social parameters. We found that androgen, estrogen, and glucorticoid levels varied with reproductive stage, with highest androgen and estrogen concentrations during nest construction and highest corticosterone concentrations during the pre-breeding stage. These stage-dependent patterns did not vary with male phenotype or auxiliary presence, though androgen levels during pre-breeding mate selection were lower in females obtaining red/black mates than those obtaining brown mates. We found no evidence that androgen, estrogen, or corticosterone levels during the fertile period were related to extra-pair young (EPY) frequency. This study demonstrates clear changes in steroid levels with reproductive stage, though it found little support for variation with social environment. We suggest hormonal responsiveness to social factors may be physiologically constrained in ways that are bypassed through exogenous hormone manipulations.  2014 Current Zoology."

The levels of these egg compounds vary in relation to environmental and genetic factors, but little is known about whether there are correlative links between maternal substances in the egg underlying common and different pathways of maternal effects. In the present study, we investigated genetically determined variability and mutually adjusted deposition of sex hormones (testosterone-T, androstenedione-A4 and progesterone-P4), antibodies (IgY) and antimicrobial proteins (lysozyme) in eggs of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica). We used different genetic lines that were independently selected for yolk T concentrations, duration of tonic immobility and social reinstatement behaviour, since both selections for behavioural traits (fearfulness and social motivation, respectively) produced considerable correlative responses in yolk androgen levels. A higher selection potential was found for increased rather than decreased yolk T concentrations, suggesting that there is a physiological minimum in egg T levels. Line differences in yolk IgY concentrations were manifested within each selection experiment, but no consistent inter-line pattern between yolk IgY and T was revealed. On the other hand, a consistent inverse inter-line pattern was recorded between yolk IgY and P4 in both selections for behavioural traits. In addition, selections for contrasting fearfulness and social motivation were associated with changes in albumen lysozyme concentrations and an inverse inter-line pattern between the deposition of yolk IgY and albumen lysozyme was found in lines selected for the level of social motivation. Thus, our results demonstrate genetically-driven changes in deposition of yolk T, P4, antibodies and albumen lysozyme in the egg. This genetic variability can partially explain mutually adjusted maternal deposition of sex hormones and immune-competent molecules but the inconsistent pattern of inter-line differences across all selections indicates that there are other underlying mechanisms, which require further studies.  2014 Okuliarova et al."

Hatching asynchrony (HA), which occurs whenever incubation commences before clutch completion, may comprise such a tactic. For instance, the sibling rivalry hypothesis states that the hierarchy among chicks, concomitant to HA, should both facilitate the adjustment of brood size to environmental conditions and reduce several components of sibling competition as compared to synchronous hatching, at both brood and individual levels. We thus predicted that brood aggression, begging and feeding rates should decrease and that older chick superiority should increase with HA increasing, leading to higher growth and survival rates. Accordingly, we investigated the effects of an experimental upward and downward manipulation of HA magnitude on behaviour, growth and survival of black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla)chicks. In line with the sibling rivalry hypothesis, synchronous hatching increased aggression and tended to increase feeding rates by parents at the brood level. Begging rates, however, increased with HA contrary to our expectations. At the individual level, as HA magnitude increased, the younger chick was attacked and begged proportionally more often, experienced a slower growth and a higher mortality than its sibling. Overall, the occurrence of energetic costs triggered by synchronous hatching both for parents and chicks, together with the lower growth rate and increased mortality of the younger chick in highly asynchronous broods suggest that natural HA magnitude may be optimal.

Conflict over care (usually considered as a type of postzygotic sexual conflict) is common, because the evolutionary interests of male and female parents are rarely identical. I investigate how sexual conflict over care may facilitate the emergence and maintenance of diverse parenting strategies and argue that researchers should combine two fundamental concepts in social behavior to understand care patterns: cooperation and conflict. Behavioral evidence of conflict over care is well established, studies have estimated specific fitness implications of conflict for males or females, and experiments have investigated specific components of conflict. However, studies are long overdue to reveal the full implications of conflict for both males and females. Manipulating (or harming) the opposite sex seems less common in postzygotic conflicts than in prezygotic conflicts because by manipulating, coercing, or harming the opposite sex, the reproductive interest of the actor is also reduced. Parental care is a complex trait, although fewstudies have yet considered the implications of multidimensionality for parental conflict. Future research in parental conflict will benefit fromunderstanding the behavioral interactions between male and female parents (e.g., negotiation, learning, and coercion), the genetic and neurogenomic bases of parental behavior, and the influence of social environment on parental strategies. Empirical studies are needed to put sexual conflict in a population context and reveal feedback between mate choice, pair bonds and parenting strategies, and their demographic consequences for the population such as mortalities and sex ratios. Taken together, sexual conflict offers a fascinating avenue for understanding the causes and consequences of parenting behavior, sex roles, and breeding system evolution.  2014 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

It is currently unclear how such protection is transferred, as in contrast to mothers, fathers do not directly provide offspring with a largeamount of substances. In addition to sperm, male flour beetles transfer seminal fluids in a spermatophore to females during copulation. Depending on whether paternal trans-generational immune priming is mediated by sperm or seminal fluids, it is expected to either affect only the genetic offspring of a male, or also their step offspring that are sired by another male. We therefore conducted a double-mating experiment and found that only the genetic offspring of an immune primed male show enhanced survival upon bacterial challenge, while phenoloxidase activity, an important insect immune trait, and the expression of the immune receptor PGRP were increased in all offspring. This indicates that information leading to enhanced survival upon pathogen exposure is transferred via sperm, and thus potentially constitutes an epigenetic effect, whereas substances transferred with the seminal fluid could have an additional influence on offspring immune traits and immunological alertness.  2014 The Authors."

If a higher trophic level, more fish-based diet is of higher quality for marine predators, then individuals with a higher trophic level diet should have a greater body mass than those feeding at a lower trophic level. We examined this hypothesis using stable isotope analysis to infer dietary trophic level and foraging habitat over threeyears in eastern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes chrysocome filholi on sub-Antarctic Campbell Island, New Zealand. Rockhopper penguins are Vulnerable to extinction because of widespread and dramatic population declines, perhaps related to nutritional stress caused by a climate-induced shift to a lower trophic level, lower quality diet. We related the stable nitrogen (15N) and carbon (13C) isotope values of blood from 70 chicks, 55 adult females, and 55 adult males to their body masses in the 2010, 2011, and 2012 breeding seasons and examined year, stage, age, and sex differences. Opposite to predictions, heavier males consumed a lower trophiclevel diet during incubation in 2011, and average chick mass was heavier in 2011 when chicks were fed a more zooplankton-based, pelagic/offshore diet than in 2012. Contrary to the suggested importance of a fish-based diet, our results support the alternative hypothesis that rockhopper penguin populations are likely to be most successful when abundant zooplankton prey are available. We caution that historic shifts to lower trophiclevel prey should not be assumed to reflect nutritional stress and a cause of population declines.  2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

The concentration of carotenoids in yolk is larger than in maternal plasma, suggesting an important role of these compounds for offspring development. Since carotenoids have to be acquired from the diet, they may be available in limiting amounts to the mothers. Here, we investigated the role of egg carotenoids for offspring growth by experimentally increasing the concentration of yolk lutein, the main carotenoid in great tit (Parus major) yolk. We subsequently measured body condition, oxidative stress, immune response, plumage colouration and fledging success. Lutein increased body mass soon after hatching and fledging success, but did not affect tarsus length, oxidative stress, immune response and plumage colouration. The higher content of yolk lutein could have increased body mass by reducing oxidative stress caused by high metabolic rates of rapidly growing embryos or by promoting cell differentiation and proliferation. The positive effect of lutein on fledging success seems to be mediated by its influence on body mass 3days post-hatch, since these two traits were correlated. The finding that our treatment did not affect traits measured later in the nestling period, except for fledging success, suggests that yolk lutein has short-term effects that are essential to increase survival until fledging. Our study shows the positive effect of yolk lutein on offspring survival in the great tit, and therefore suggests an important role of carotenoid-mediated maternal effects.  2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Here, we tested whether barn swallows Hirundo rustica allocated antibodies against a novel antigen to their eggs according to embryo sex depending on maternal melanin-based coloration while controlling for paternal tail ornamentation. Egg antibody concentration increased with maternal plumage darkness in broods with relatively more females, whereas it decreased in broods with relatively more males. Thus, darker females allocated more antibodies to their eggs when offspring sex ratio was female biased, whereas paler females allocated more antibodies to the eggs when offspring sex ratio was male biased. These effects were independent of laying order. Our results are compatible with the hypotheses that maternal allocation to sons depends on their reproductive value as predicted by heritable melanin-based coloration and with the hypothesis of differential susceptibility of pheomelanic daughters to parasitism. These effects may depend on pleiotropy of the genes that control melanogenesis and immunity, which may differentially act on investment in self-maintenance and maternal effects. This study is the first study in vertebrates of the association between maternal effects on either sex via egg quality and parental melanization. The links between the genetic control of melanogenesis and of major fitness traits like immunity and the role of maternal effects in reproductive strategies prompt for more studies of the covariation between parental coloration and maternal sex-dependent allocation via egg quality.  2014  The Author 2014.

Such maternal effects also allow young that may be exposed to disease in early life to focus resources on growth and development at this critical period of development. Maternally transferred antibodies are therefore an important source of phenotypic variation in host phenotype as well as influencing host susceptibility and tolerance to infection across generations. It has previously been assumed the transfer of antibodies is passive and invariant and reflects the level of circulating antibody in the mother at the time of transfer. However, whether females may vary in the relative amount of protection transferred to offspring has seldom been explored.Results: Here we show that females differ widely in the relative amount of specific blood antibodies they transfer to the embryonic environment (range 9.2%-38.4% of their own circulating levels) in Chinese painted quail (Coturnix chinensis). Relative transfer levels were unrelated to the size of a female's own immune response. Furthermore, individual females were consistent in their transfer level, both across different stages of their immune response and when challenged with different vaccine types. The amount of antibody transferred was related to female condition, but baseline antibody responses of mothers were not. However, we found no evidence for any trade-offs between the relative amount of antibody transferred with other measures of reproductive investment.Conclusions: These results suggest that the relative amount of antibodies transferred to offspring can vary significantly and consistently between females. Levels of transfer may therefore be a separate trait open to manipulation or selection with potential consequences for offspring health and fitness in both wild and domesticated populations.  2014 Coakley et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

We tested this hypothesis in house wrens (Troglodytes aedon) using a within-clutch design in which we induced females to produce more eggs (8-10 eggs) than they normally would (6 or 7 eggs) to determine whether maternal effort and the allocation of resources to supernumerary eggs (those laid beyond the usual number) influence the offspring sex ratio. At the clutch level, we predicted that high-quality females, as defined by their ability to produce supernumerary eggs in response to egg removal, would overproduce sons relative to females treated the same way but producing fewer eggs. At the level of the egg, we predicted that supernumerary eggs would more likely contain daughters than sons. As predicted, females producing extralarge clutches overproduced sons and those producing smaller clutches produced relatively more daughters. Last-laid eggs were also more likely to contain daughters than earlier-laid eggs although there was no difference in the mass of eggs containing males and females. These results suggest that mothers adjust the sex of their offspring strategically to maximize fitness.  The Author 2013."

Successful dispersal depends on a complex blend of decisions at all main stages of the dispersal process: emigration, prospection for a site, and settling. Costs and benefits of such decisions are expected to depend on sex and on the ecological context, on individual physiological state, and on concomitant decisions by relatives, which affect competition with kin and inbreeding. We analyzed natal dispersal propensity (i.e., dispersing or not) and dispersal distance in the semicolonial barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) in relation to context-, phenotype-, and kin-dependent factors. Females had larger dispersal propensity and distance than males. Dispersal propensity of both sexes was negatively density dependent and was less likely from colonies (farms) with large number of livestock, which is important to barn swallow distribution. Dispersal propensity was larger among males ranking high in the body mass brood hierarchy and smaller among late-hatched females. Dispersal distance was larger for late-hatched males and for females that ranked high in the body mass brood hierarchy. Finally, both dispersal propensity and distance of males increased with the number of male siblings. We, thus, identified several context-, phenotype-, and kin-dependent components of dispersal decisions. Phenotype-dependent effects suggest that decisions of whether to disperse and of dispersal distance are different processes under control of sex-specific traits. Finally, male dispersal behavior suggests that kin selection favors males that reduce the risk of sib-sib mating competition, in a population with male-biased tertiary sex ratio.  The Author 2013."

However, the extent of this laying order effect is expected to vary among clutches according to laying date, due to possible differences between early-nesting and late-nesting females with regards to their ability to control the transfer of maternal resources to the eggs. A laying date effect could also result from a seasonal decline in the availability of dietary carotenoids. In this study, we collected data from Yellow-legged Gulls (Larus michahellis) breeding in southern Tunisia to investigate how nesting date interacts with egg-laying order in shaping patterns of within-clutch variation in yolk lutein, the most abundant carotenoid in this species. In particular, we examined (1) whether yolk lutein concentration declined along the laying sequence and (2) whether the extent of the decline differed among clutches according to laying date. Our results show that yolk lutein decreased along the laying sequence at the clutch level. More interestingly, they also show that the decrease in yolk lutein levels along the laying sequence was more pronounced in late clutches than in early clutches, although lutein levels in adult plasma did not vary according to laying date. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that the Yellow-legged Gull employs the brood reduction strategy and that said strategy is more drastically applied in late clutches than in early clutches.

Here we investigated the relationship between pre-breeding and breeding plasma PRL and LH and clutch-size in captive-breeding female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Using a repeated-measures design, we followed individual females from pre-breeding, through multiple breeding attempts, and attempted to decrease PRL using the D2-receptor agonist, bromocriptine. Clutch size was independent of variation in pre-breeding PRL or LH, although pre-breeding LH was negatively correlated with the time between pairing and the onset of laying. Clutch size was independent of variation in plasma PRL on all days of egg-laying. Bromocriptine treatment had no effect on plasma PRL, but in this breeding attempt clutch size was also independent of plasma PRL. Finally, we found no evidence for an inverse relationship between plasma PRL and LH levels, as predicted if PRL had inhibitory effects via LH. Thus, our data fail to provide any support for the involvement of circulating PRL in clutch size determination. These findings suggest that alternative models for hormonal control of avian clutch size need to be considered, perhaps involving downstream regulation of plasma PRL at the level of the ovary, or other hormones that have not been considered to date.  2014 Elsevier Inc."

Modulation of CORT secretion occurs in several reptile species, such that elevated baseline CORT concentration and/or a dampened CORT response are common during reproductive life-history events. We investigated CORT secretion after 24. h capture-restraint in the oviparous tuatara ( Sphenodon punctatus), the last living rhynchocephalian, and tested whether gravid females have a dampened CORT response compared with non-gravid females. We also included males as a comparison. We confirmed that gravid females have significantly higher baseline plasma CORT concentrations than non-gravid females, suggesting increased CORT secretion during nesting. Furthermore, we found that gravid females exhibit a dampened CORT response compared to non-gravid females and males. Our results demonstrate that female reproductive condition influences CORT secretion in tuatara, and suggest that gravid females modulate CORT secretion during nesting to maintain homeostasis, effectively increasing chances of reproductive success and promoting overall fitness.  2014 Elsevier Inc."

Transferring steroids to the yolk is one way mothers can translate environmental information into potential adaptive signals for offspring. However, maternally-derived hormones might also have adverse effects for offspring. For example, recent data in zebra finch chicks suggested that ageing related-processes (i.e. oxidative stress and telomere loss) were increased after egg-injection of corticosterone (CORT). Still, we have few experimental data describing the effect of maternal effects on the growth-ageing trade-off in offspring. Here, we chronically treated pre-laying zebra finch females (Taeniopygia guttata) with 17--estradiol (E2) or CORT, and followed offspring growth and cellular ageing rates (oxidative stress and telomere loss). CORT treatment decreased growth rate in male chicks and increased rate of telomere loss in mothers and female offspring. E2 increased body mass gain in male offspring, while reducing oxidative stress in both sexes but without affecting telomere loss. Since shorter telomeres were previously found to be a proxy of individual lifespan in zebra finches, maternal effects may, through pleiotropic effects, be important determinants of offspring life-expectancy by modulating ageing rate during embryo and post-natal growth.  2014 Tissier et al."

In birds, plumage renewal is a demanding activity, which accomplishes fundamental functions, such as allowing thermal insulation, aerodynamics and socio-sexual signaling. Feather renewal is a very expensive and disabling process, and molt is often partitioned from breeding and migration. However, trade-offs between feather renewal and breeding have been only sparsely studied. In barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) breeding in Italy and undergoing molt during wintering in sub-Saharan Africa, we studied this trade-off by removing a tail feather from a large sample of individuals and analyzing growth bar width, reflecting feather growth rate, and length of the growing replacement feather in relation to the stage in the breeding cycle at removal and clutch size. Growth bar width of females and length of the growing replacement feather of both sexes were smaller when the original feather had been removed after clutch initiation. Importantly, in females both growth bar width and replacement feather length were negatively predicted by clutch size, and more strongly so for large clutches and when feather removal occurred immediately after clutch completion. Hence, we found strong, coherent evidence for a trade-off between reproduction, and laying effort in particular, and the ability to generate new feathers. These results support the hypothesis that the derived condition of molting during wintering in long-distance migrants is maintained by the costs of overlapping breeding and molt.  2014 Saino et al."

Periodic visits to the nests (daily at some stages) allowed the determination of breeding parameters of interest. General linear models were used for analyses.Results On average, incubation started the day of laying of the last egg and lasted 13.2 days. The hatching period lasted 1.7 days. Incubation started earlier relative to clutch completion as temperatures during the laying period were higher and as clutch size increased. The incubation period was shorter if incubation started later relative to clutch completion. Hatching asynchrony increased as incubation started earlier relative to clutch completion and as the incubation period decreased.Conclusions The onset of incubation relative to clutch completion is highly variable, and has important consequences for the duration of the incubation and hatching periods. Starting incubation before or after clutch completion could, respectively, advance or delay the hatching date, although advancement would be at the cost of increasing the degree of hatching asynchrony.  2014 British Trust for Ornithology."

Although maternal effects have been a focus of much recent research, little is known about the long-term consequences of disturbance of the maternal social environment on offspring phenotype in socially monogamous and biparental species. We hypothesized that pair separation followed by re-pairing may generate maternal effects on offspring development. Here, we gave previously paired female zebra finches access to new males 6 days following removal of their original partner to assess experimentally the effects of re-pairing (an ecologically relevant form of social disturbance) on female reproductive investment, yolk corticosterone concentrations and subsequent offspring phenotype. Pair disruption boosted growth in female offspring and delayed the development of plumage colour sex dimorphism in males. Although yolk corticosterone concentrations were not affected by the treatment, offspring from treated mothers were less responsive to social isolation in a novel environment compared to control offspring. This is, to our knowledge, the first study demonstrating that maternal re-pairing prior to hatching has long-lasting effects on offspring phenotype in a socially monogamous and biparental species. Our results also suggest that prehatching maternal effects of this social disturbance are not mediated by maternal yolk corticosterone. Additional studies are required to determine the potential pathways of these maternal effects (e.g. other hormones, epigenetic programming, protein/nutrient content of eggs, etc.) and their adaptive value.  2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

Many experimental studies have shown that stress in the parents can affect anxiety in the offspring, but until now these effects have been neglected in addressing the problem of SFP in commercially kept laying hens. We therefore studied whether parental stock (PS) affected the development of SFP and anxiety in their offspring. We used flocks from a brown and white genetic hybrid because genetic background can affect SFP and anxiety. As SFP can also be influenced by housing conditions on the rearing farm, we included effects of housing system and litter availability in the analysis. Forty-seven rearing flocks, originating from ten PS flocks were followed. Behavioral and physiological parameters related to anxiety and SFP were studied in the PS at 40 weeks of age and in the rearing flocks at one, five, ten and fifteen weeks of age. We found that PS had an effect on SFP at one week of age and on anxiety at one and five weeks of age. In the white hybrid, but not in the brown hybrid, high levels of maternal corticosterone, maternal feather damage and maternal whole-blood serotonin levels showed positive relations with offsprings' SFP at one week and offsprings' anxiety at one and five weeks of age. Disruption and limitation of litter supply at an early age on the rearing farms increased SFP, feather damage and fearfulness. These effects were most prominent in the brown hybrid. It appeared that hens from a brown hybrid are more affected by environmental conditions, while hens from a white hybrid were more strongly affected by parental effects. These results are important for designing measures to prevent the development of SFP, which may require a different approach in brown and white flocks.  2014 de Haas et al."

Here, zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) that had experienced either early low or high nutritional conditions raised their offspring under either matched or mismatched nutritional conditions. Parental and offspring early conditions both separately affected the offspring's adult phenotype, but early conditions experienced by parents and offspring did not interact as predicted.

Because different egg components can have opposite effects on offspring phenotype, selection is expected to favour their mutual adjustment, resulting in a significant covariation between egg components within and/or among clutches. Here we tested for such correlations between maternally derived yolk immunoglobulins and yolk androgens in great tit (Parus major) eggs using a multivariate mixed-model approach. We found no association between yolk immunoglobulins and yolk androgens within clutches, indicating that within clutches the two egg components are deposited independently. Across clutches, however, there was a significant negative relationship between yolk immunoglobulins and yolk androgens, suggesting that selection has co-adjusted their deposition. Furthermore, an experimental manipulation of ectoparasite load affected patterns of covariance among egg components. Yolk immunoglobulins are known to play an important role in nestling immune defence shortly after hatching, whereas yolk androgens, although having growth-enhancing effects under many environmental conditions, can be immunosuppressive. We therefore speculate that variation in the risk of parasitism may play an important role in shaping optimal egg composition and may lead to the observed pattern of yolk immunoglobulin and yolk androgen deposition across clutches. More generally, our case study exemplifies how multivariate mixed-model methodology presents a flexible tool to not only quantify, but also test patterns of (co)variation across different organisational levels and environments, allowing for powerful hypothesis testing in ecophysiology.  2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Asynchronous hatching, resulting from the onset of incubation before clutch completion, facilitates the establishment of within-nest hierarchy, with younger chicks being subject to lower feeding and growth rates. Because social and nutritional stresses affect baseline stress hormone levels in birds, younger chicks are expected to have higher levels of corticosterone than their siblings. As previous studies showed that hatching asynchrony magnitude influences the course of sibling competition, it should also affect baseline corticosterone. We measured baseline corticosterone at age 5. days in nestling black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) in 3 types of experimental broods: synchronous, asynchronous, and highly asynchronous. Sexual dimorphism takes place during chick-rearing and might also influence baseline corticosterone, we thus included chick sex in our analyses and also monitored chick growth and survival. Baseline corticosterone did not differ among A-chicks, but was higher in B-chicks from highly asynchronous broods compared with the other brood types, in line with the presumed increase in nutritional stress. In asynchronous broods, A-chicks had higher baseline corticosterone than their siblings, contrary to our expectations. We interpret that result as a cost of dominance among A-chicks. In line with previous studies, mass gain was negatively correlated with baseline corticosterone levels. We found that baseline corticosterone predicted survival in a sex-specific way. Regardless of hatching rank, males with higher baseline corticosterone suffered higher mortality, suggesting that males were more sensitive to high level of stress, independently of its cause.  2013 Elsevier Inc."

Surprisingly, however, the effects of glucocorticoids on such traits have not been formally integrated with androgen-based models of sexual selection. Here we point out that consideration of glucocorticoid-mediated effects on the phenotype provides new insight into long-standing hypotheses and controversies associated with such models. In particular, androgen-based 'handicap' models of sexual selection characteristically hinge on graded effects of androgens on male traits, but few studies have found support for such a relationship, suggesting that androgens may not be a primary target of selection. We propose, however, that in many instances, androgens may not appear to have a graded effect on the phenotype because elevated glucocorticoids mask the effects of androgens. Glucocorticoids may be inextricably linked to elaborate traits because the energetic demands associated with such traits promote glucocorticoid production. We thus propose that glucocorticoid-mediated effects on male traits warrant re-evaluation of androgen-based models of sexual selection. In particular, we argue that androgen-based handicap models cannot be dismissed based on the lack of evidence for a graded relationship between androgen level and the extent or magnitude of the trait. Our review of the literature indicates that most studies have examined either the effects of androgens or the effects of glucocorticoids, but not both. A more integrated approach involving the effects of both steroids is necessary to fully understand the role of androgens and the endocrine targets of selection associated with the expression of elaborate male traits.  2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

In this study, we injected low (0.2. g) and high (1. g) doses of CORT into developing embryos on day 11 of incubation (E11) and tested the changes in aggressive behavior and hypothalamic gene expression on posthatch chickens of different ages. In ovo administration of high dose CORT significantly suppressed the growth rate from 3. weeks of age and increased the frequency of aggressive behaviors, and the dosage was associated with elevated plasma CORT concentrations and significantly downregulated hypothalamic expression of arginine vasotocin (AVT) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). The hypothalamic content of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein was significantly decreased in the high dose group (p. <. 0.05), whereas no changes were observed for GR mRNA. High dose CORT exposure significantly increased platelet serotonin (5-HT) uptake, decreased whole blood 5-HT concentration (p. <. 0.05), downregulated hypothalamic tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) mRNA and upregulated 5-HT receptor 1A (5-HTR1A) and monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) mRNA, but not monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). High dose CORT also significantly increased DNA methylation of the hypothalamic GR and CRH gene promoters (p. <. 0.05).

We measured testosterone, lysozyme and ovotransferrin concentrations in their eggs. Females paired with dominant males laid eggs with higher testosterone concentration, while egg mass, lysozyme and ovotransferrin concentrations did not differ.

In this study, cortisol content was measured by radioimmunoassay for the first time in eggs of Persian sturgeon Acipenser persicus to elicit at which times during early developmental stages, that they were particularly sensitive to stressful events. In this study, fertilized eggs of mature Persian sturgeons were placed in special boxes (as replicates) that were put in incubation units of Yushchenko. To assess pre-stress samples (resting cortisol levels), 5 eggs were selected randomly from each box in 7 important stages of incubation (2-cell division, blastula, end of blastula, mid of gastrula, neurula, eyed stage and heart beaten). In another experiment, eggs were exposed to an acute stress (10 min out of water) in 7 developmental stages. For determination of post-stress cortisol, eggs were collected 2 and 6 h after the stress. The results indicated significant difference in various stages of incubation but cortisol levels revealed no differences in whole-body levels between stressed samples (2 and 6 h post-stress) and unstressed samples (P > 0.05). The highest percentage of hatching rate for post-stressed eggs was recorded in 2-cell division stage while this percentage declined steadily in the heart beaten stage when a statistically significant difference was revealed with regard to other stages (P = 0.000). These findings suggested that sturgeon eggs were not so much sensitive in their early developmental stages and relatively resistant to stress. However, significant decrease in survival rate in heart beaten stage showed a sensitivity of this stage to stress. Lack of an increase in cortisol after acute stress indicated that hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis for cortisol synthesis was not yet functional. However, further studies seem necessary to clarify when HPI axis is activated in this species.  2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

The aim of this study was to assess the influence of an experimental decrease in prolactin levels on foraging decisions and its consequences on breeding success in free-living seabirds. To achieve this, we implanted bromocriptine (an inhibitor of prolactin secretion) in male Adlie penguins ( Pygoscelis adeliae), monitored their foraging behavior using time-depth recorders over several trips, and recorded their reproductive output.On average 8  0.5. days after implantation, we showed that bromocriptine administration led to an efficient decrease in prolactin levels. However, no differences were seen in foraging trip durations between bromocriptine-implanted birds and controls. Moreover, the time spent diving and the number of dives performed per trip were similar in both groups. By contrast, all diving parameters (including diving efficiency) were negatively affected by the treatment during the first at-sea trip following the treatment. Finally, the treatment did not affect adult body condition or chick growth and survival.Our study highlights the short-term negative effect of low prolactin levels on diving effort, but indicates that a short-term and/or low-magnitude decrease in prolactin levels alone is not sufficient to modify consistently the body maintenance or the parental investment of Adlie penguins.  2013 Elsevier Inc."

Incubation at the threshold, or pivotal, temperature (PvT) yields an even ratio of males and females. This strong susceptibility to temperature indicates that each embryo of this species is competent to develop as a male or a female. However, the mechanism that determines sexual fate at the PvT has not been identified. One possibility is that sexual fate is stochastic at the PvT, but coordinated by systemic signals within a single embryo. If this is the case, gonads explanted separately to culture should not coordinate their fate. Here we show that gonad pairs from embryos incubated at the PvT share a strong predisposition for one sex or the other when cultured in isolation, indicating that they were affected by shared genetic signals, maternally-deposited yolk hormones or other transient influences received prior to the stage of dissection. In ovo studies involving shifts from the male- or female-producing temperature to the PvT further indicate that embryos adopt a sexual differentiation trajectory many days prior to the onset of morphological differentiation into testes or ovaries and usually maintain this fate in the absence of an extreme temperature signal favoring the development of the other sex. Our findings therefore suggest that the outcome of sex determination in these reptiles is heavily influenced (i) by an inherent predisposition at the PvT and (ii) by the sexual differentiation trajectory established early in gonad development under male- or female-producing temperatures.  2013 Elsevier Inc."

Parents should respond to begging because of the differential fitness returns obtained from their investment in offspring that differ in condition. For analogous reasons, offspring should adjust their behavior to cues/signals of parental condition: parents that differ in condition pay differential costs of care and, hence, should provide different amounts of food. In this study, we experimentally tested in the European earwig (Forficula auricularia) if cues of maternal condition affect offspring behavior in terms of sibling cannibalism. We experimentally manipulated female condition by providing them with different amounts of food, kept nymph condition constant, allowed for nymph exposure to chemical maternal cues over extended time, quantified nymph survival (deaths being due to cannibalism) and extracted and analyzed the females' cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC). Nymph survival was significantly affected by chemical cues of maternal condition, and this effect depended on the timing of breeding. Cues of poor maternal condition enhanced nymph survival in early broods, but reduced nymph survival in late broods, and vice versa for cues of good condition. Furthermore, female condition affected the quantitative composition of their CHC profile which in turn predicted nymph survival patterns. Thus, earwig offspring are sensitive to chemical cues of maternal condition and nymphs from early and late broods show opposite reactions to the same chemical cues. Together with former evidence on maternal sensitivities to condition-dependent nymph chemical cues, our study shows context-dependent reciprocal information exchange about condition between earwig mothers and their offspring, potentially mediated by cuticular hydrocarbons.  2014 Wong et al."

Recent theory motivated by these intriguing empirical patterns predicted both positive (differential allocation) and negative (reproductive compensation) effects of mating with a preferred male on female investment. These predictions, however, focused on total reproductive effort and did not distinguish between a response in offspring size and clutch size. Here, we model how specific paternal effects on fitness affect maternal allocation to offspring size and number. The specific mechanism by which males affect the fitness of females or their offspring determines whether and how females allocated differentially. Offspring size is predicted to increase when males benefit offspring survival, but decrease when males increase offspring growth rate. Clutch size is predicted to increase when males contribute to female resources (e.g. with a nuptial gift) and when males increase offspring growth rate. The predicted direction and magnitude of female responses vary with female age, but only when per-offspring paternal benefits decline with clutch size.We conclude that considering specific paternal effects on fitness in the context of maternal life-history trade-offs can help explain mixed empirical patterns of differential allocation and reproductive compensation.  2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

In iteroparous species, maternal exposure to stressors generally results in offspring ill-equipped for survival. Still, opportunities for future fecundity can offset low quality offspring. Little is known, however, as to how intergenerational effects of stress manifest in semelparous species with only a single breeding episode. Such mothers would suffer a total loss of fitness if offspring cannot survive past multiple life stages. We evaluated whether chronic exposure of female sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) to a chase stressor impaired offspring performance traits. Egg size and early offspring survival were not influenced by maternal exposure to the repeated acute stressor. Later in development, fry reared from stressed mothers swam for shorter periods of time but possessed a superior capacity to re-initiate bouts of burst swimming. In contrast to iteroparous species, the mechanisms driving the observed effects do not appear to be related to cortisol, as egg hormone concentrations did not vary between stressed and undisturbed mothers. Sockeye salmon appear to possess buffering strategies that protect offspring from deleterious effects of maternal stress that would otherwise compromise progeny during highly vulnerable stages of development. Whether stressed sockeye salmon mothers endow offspring with traits that are matched or mismatched for survival in the unpredictable environment they encountered is discussed.

Natural selection thus favours females that produce eggs with high A4 and low T concentrations.

A total of 200 Ross broiler breeder hens at 42 weeks of age were randomly divided into two groups: MS or control. Hens in the MS were fed 2 mg/hen/d CORT for 14 d. Eggs (648 and 635 eggs for MS and control, respectively) were collected from d 3 to 14 of dietary CORT supplementation and incubated. Weights of embryo, chicks and organs and body composition were determined during incubation and at hatch. Biochemical blood parameters were measured at internal pipping stage and day of hatch. Hatching performance and embryonic mortalities were recorded.3. Hens fed a diet supplemented with CORT had lighter body weight and produced less eggs at the end of the 14-d treatment period. Although MS embryos were heavier than control from 12 to 18 d of incubation, chick weight was similar at the day of hatch. Lower relative weights for yolk sac and bursa were observed at 12 d of incubation for MS chicks compared to control. Chicks from both groups had similar body content in spite of higher fat content of MS embryos on d 18 of incubation.4. MS had no effect on the duration of incubation or hatching performance but increased mortality at the pipping stage.5. The results suggest that hormone-mediated MS might affect embryonic development during incubation without adverse effect on chick weight and body composition.  2014 British Poultry Science Ltd."

We used intracellular markers to ask whether breaking of L-R symmetry could be observed at earlier stages. Observation of two- to three-cell embryos carrying intracellular markers indicated that L-R symmetry is broken concomitantly with establishment of D-V axis polarity during division of the anterior AB cell. The AB cleavage furrow initiates asymmetrically and always from the left, suggesting L-R differences in the AB cell cortex. An invariantly handed cortical rotation observed earlier during first cleavage implies that the one-cell embryo has an intrinsic chirality. We propose that L-R differences in the cortex could result from mechanical forces on asymmetric components of a chiral cortical network during the off-axis elongation of the AB-cell spindle prior to AB cleavage. genesis 52:572-580, 2014.  2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

We previously demonstrated that the injection of a physiological amount of testosterone (T) in the eggs of ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) disrupted the covariation among male morphological traits at sexual maturity and positively affected male mating success. Here, we investigate whether egg T exposure affected adult male circulating T levels at the onset of the breeding season (reflecting gonadal maturation), and the relationship between circulating T and male traits. Egg T exposure did not affect pre-mating plasma T. T levels were not associated with the expression of secondary sexual and non-sexual traits or socio-sexual behaviour (social rank, overall fighting ability and mating success). However, wattle brightness decreased with increasing circulating T in males hatched from T-eggs (T-males) but not among control males. In dyadic encounters during the peak mating period, control males with higher pre-mating T levels had higher chances of being dominant over other control males. However, higher pre-mating T levels did not predict success in male-male competition in encounters involving T-males. We suggest that the long-term effects of egg T on male phenotype do not originate from differential gonadal maturation according to egg T treatment. Rather, prenatal androgens may have priming effects on functioning of target tissues, translating into differential phenotypic effects according to androgen exposure during embryonic development.  2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH."

We manipulated perceived predation risk using models and vocalizations of sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus). At the start of incubation, we swapped whole clutches between treated and untreated nests to separate pre-laying maternal effects from posthatching effects. Since costs and benefits of maternal responses to parasites need to be assessed under parasite pressure, we infested half of the rearing nests with hen fleas. Parasites had negative effects on mass gain and wing growth, both via maternal effects and via direct exposure of nestlings, whereas maternal predation risk had no significant effect. The interaction between predator and parasite treatments was not significant and, thus, suggests the absence of a trade-off between the 2 stressors operating at the level of maternal effects. Alternatively, the complexity of the design, despite a relatively large sample size, may have limited the power for detection of this expected trade-off.  2014  The Author 2014."

It is known that this type of maternal investment can be influenced by the quality of the male partner. In this study, we first verify that male song is important in the mate choice of female Eurasian reed warblers, as males mate faster when their singing is more complex. Furthermore, female egg investment varies in relation to male song characteristics. Interestingly, clutch size, egg weight, or size, which can be considered as an high-cost investment, is not influenced by male song characteristics, whereas comparably low-cost investment types like investment into diverse egg components are adjusted to male song characteristics. In line with this, our results suggest that female allocation rules depend on investment type as well as song characteristics. For example, egg white lysozyme is positively correlated with male song complexity. In contrast, a negative correlation exists between-song speed and syllable repetitiveness and egg yolk weight as well as egg yolk testosterone concentration. Thus, our results suggest that female egg investment is related to male song performance in several aspects, but female investment patterns regarding various egg compounds are not simply correlated.  2014 The Authors.

It has been suggested that the adaptive value of such prenatal maternal effects may depend on the environment encountered by the offspring after birth, and that offspring may perform better when environmental conditions encountered by the mother and the offspring match, than when a mismatch occurs. Here, we test how prenatal maternal effects and postnatal conditions interact in influencing offspring growth and development in wild-living great tits (Parus major) by manipulating food availability experienced by the mother before egg laying, partially cross-fostering nestlings between nests, and manipulating food availability after hatching. We observed significant interaction effects between pre- and postnatal food conditions. Nonsupplemented nestlings reached a similar fledging mass, a trait closely linked to postfledging survival, as food-supplemented nestlings when their biological mother had received extra food during egg laying. It shows that prenatal maternal investment can compensate for growth-limiting conditions after hatching. This effect was sex specific, with daughters benefiting more than sons. Furthermore, food-supplemented nestlings grew largest when their biological mother had not received extra food during egg laying, suggesting that offspring were primed prenatally, possibly through differential egg composition, to use resources more efficiently. However, we found no evidence that offspring performed generally better when pre- and postnatal food conditions matched than when a mismatch occurred.

We manipulated the amount of prey available to female brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei) to evaluate how this factor affects patterns of reproductive investment (total egg output, egg size, yolk steroids) and offspring viability (morphology, growth, survival). Experimental reduction of yolk in a subset of eggs enabled us to evaluate a potential causal mechanism (yolk investment) that mediates the effect of maternal prey availability on offspring viability. We show that limited prey availability significantly reduced egg size, which negatively influenced offspring size, growth, and survival. Experimental yolk removal from eggs directly reduced offspring size, which, in turn, negatively affected offspring growth and survival.

During this interplay both behaviors, offspring begging and parental provisioning, can exert a selective pressure on the expression of the other. It has, therefore, been predicted that traits involved in this interplay may coevolve and ultimately become (genetically) correlated. Such covariation has-at least at the phenotypic level-been found in a number of cross-fostering studies, including evidence from the canary (Serinus canaria), our model species. However, a common challenge for these studies has been to establish a genetic covariation given the difficulty to disentangle the relative contribution of genetic and maternal effects, as the latter may act already before cross-fostering. We addressed this problem by studying within-individual covariation between begging (expressed at the nestling stage) and provisioning (expressed at the adult stage). In addition, we estimated the degree of heritability of these behaviors using parent-offspring regressions, as inheritance forms a prerequisite for any genetic correlation. Both traits showed a low to moderate non-significant heritability, similar to those previously reported in other bird species. However, offspring begging and parental provisioning did not covary at the intra-individual level. Thus, individuals begging intensively as nestlings were not necessarily individuals that provided more food as adults or vice versa. These findings provide important insights for our understanding of coadaptation, suggesting that factors other than genes such as maternal effects may play a role in adjusting offspring begging to the levels of parental provisioning.  2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Here, we tested the potential of yolk testosterone to affect sexual selection by experimentally increasing the yolk testosterone levels via egg injections. We focused on two central axes of sexual selection, male-male competition for access to a female (intra-sexual selection) and female mate choice behaviour (inter-sexual selection), using canaries (Serinus canaria) as a model species. Neither male agonistic behaviour nor access to the opposite sex, as measured in staged male-male encounters in the presence of a female, were affected by experimentally elevating yolk testosterone levels. We did not find any evidence for effects on female mate choice behaviour either, given the lack of significant effects on mate choice activity, consistency in female mate choice or choosiness. In conclusion, our results indicate that the consequences of yolk testosterone for sexual selection through changes in behavioural traits, which are expressed during pair formation or male-male competition, are probably limited.  2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

The embryonic developmental process has been shown to begin in the oviduct such that the embryo has attained either the blastodermal and/or gastrulation stage of development at oviposition. Bird embryos can be affected by ""maternal effects,"" and by environmental conditions during the pre-incubation and incubation periods. ""Maternal effects"" has been described as an evolutionary mechanism that has provided the mother, by hormonal deposition into the yolk, with the potential to proactively influence the development of her progeny by exposing them to her particular hormonal pattern in such a manner as to influence their ability to cope with the expected wide range of environmental conditions that may occur post-hatching. Another important aspect of ""maternal effects"" is the effect of the maternal nutrient intake on progeny traits. From a commercial broiler chicken production perspective, it has been established that greater cumulative nutrient intake by the hen during her pullet rearing phase prior to photostimulation resulted in faster growing broiler progeny. Generally, maternal effects on progeny, which have both a genetic and an environmental component represented by yolk hormones deposition and embryo nutrient utilization, have an important effect on the development of a wide range of progeny traits. Furthermore, commercial embryo development during preincubation storage and incubation, as well as during incubation per se has been shown to largely depend upon temperature, while other environmental factors that include egg position during storage, and the amount of H2O and CO2 lost by the egg and the subsequent effect on albumen pH and height during storage have become important environmental factors to be considered for successful embryogenesis under commercial conditions. Manipulating environmental temperature during the period of egg storage, during the intermediate pre-incubation period, and incubation period per se has been found to significantly affect embryo development, hatching progress, chick quality at hatching, and chick development post-hatching. These temperature manipulations have also been shown to affect the acquisition of thermotolerance to subsequent post-hatching thermal challenge. This chapter will focus on: a. ""maternal effects"" on embryo and post-hatching development; b. environmental effects during the post-ovipositional period of egg storage, the intermediate pre-incubation period, and incubation period per se on chick embryogenesis and subsequent posthatching growth and development; and c. effects of temperature manipulations during the pre-incubation and incubation periods on acquisition of thermotolerance and development of secondary sexual characteristics in broiler chickens.

Most predictions focus, however, on maternal effects that affect only a single character, whereas the evolution of maternal effects is poorly understood in the presence of suites of interacting traits. To overcome this, we simulate the evolution of multivariate maternal effects (captured by the matrix <bold>M</bold>) in a fluctuating environment. We find that the rate of environmental fluctuations has a substantial effect on the properties of <bold>M</bold>: in slowly changing environments, offspring are selected to have a multivariate phenotype roughly similar to the maternal phenotype, so that <bold>M</bold> is characterized by positive dominant eigenvalues; by contrast, rapidly changing environments favor <bold>M</bold>s with dominant eigenvalues that are negative, as offspring favor a phenotype which substantially differs from the maternal phenotype. Moreover, when fluctuating selection on one maternal character is temporally delayed relative to selection on other traits, we find a striking pattern of cross-trait maternal effects in which maternal characters influence not only the same character in offspring, but also other offspring characters. Additionally, when selection on one character contains more stochastic noise relative to selection on other traits, large cross-trait maternal effects evolve from those maternal traits that experience the smallest amounts of noise. The presence of these cross-trait maternal effects shows that individual maternal effects cannot be studied in isolation, and that their study in a multivariate context may provide important insights about the nature of past selection. Our results call for more studies that measure multivariate maternal effects in wild populations.  2014 Kuijper et al."

The behavioural characteristics of an individual are determined by its genes and by its physical and social environment. Not only the individual's early life and current environment are of importance, but also the environment of previous generations. Through epigenetic processes, stress in parents and even grandparents can translate into changes in behavioural and physical characteristics of the offspring. Another influential factor for behavioural development is maternal hormones. Recent studies indicate that hormonal effects may also be closely related to epigenetic changes. Also, the environment during ontogeny has considerable impact on behavioural development: in both mice and laying hens, high quality maternal care resulted in animals that were less fearful. In laying hens maternal care also led to a reduction in cannibalistic pecking. Genetic selection and selection experiments will also play a key role in breeding animals for the housing systems of the future. To optimize behavioural development of farm animals and to minimize risks of damaging behaviour, integral approaches are needed that combine selection of the optimal genotype with provision of a favourable environment for parents and offspring, both during ontogeny and later life.  2014 Elsevier B.V."

Mechanisms that have been suggested are changes in the endogenous androgen production post-hatching or changes in the sensitivity towards circulating androgens. We tested the effects of yolk testosterone on the plasma testosterone levels and the sensitivity to testosterone in 5. months old male canaries that hatched from eggs that were either injected with testosterone (yT-males) or with a control solution (yC-males). Changes in sensitivity were investigated via the behavioural response to an experimental elevation of the plasma testosterone levels. We performed the experiment in fall (low endogenous testosterone production), focusing on testosterone dependent response traits (aggression and song).Before implantation, there was a non-significant trend that the plasma testosterone levels were lower in yT-males than in yC-males. Elevating the plasma testosterone concentrations increased aggressiveness, song bout length and similarity of repeated song elements (=consistency), with the latter likely being a consequence of testosterone-driven song crystallization. However, these effects were not different among yT- or yC-males in any of the parameters. Thus, our findings render it unlikely that changes in the sensitivity to testosterone post-hatching would form the main underlying mechanism of hormone-mediated maternal effects in birds.

Hence, the coordination of how genes are expressed, the orchestration of the genome so to say, responds dynamically to environmental challenges. In this selective review, the evidence in support of such mechanisms is discussed. Data show that epigenetic mechanisms can be affected by stress in different life phases, even prenatally, and this can cause long-term modifications of behaviour and stress susceptibility. Several studies show that such effects can even persist into coming generations. Research on chickens demonstrates that chronic, as well as brief events of stress cause transgenerationally stable changes of brain gene expression, behaviour and HPA-axis sensitivity.

We find that grip2a mRNA is localized to the vegetal pole of the oocyte and early embryo, and that during egg activation this mRNA shifts to an off-center vegetal position corresponding to the previously proposed teleost cortical rotation. hecate mutants show defects in the alignment and bundling of microtubules at the vegetal cortex, which result in defects in the asymmetric movement of wnt8a mRNA as well as anchoring of the kinesin-associated cargo adaptor Syntabulin. We also find that, although short-range shifts in vegetal signals are affected in hecate mutant embryos, these mutants exhibit normal long-range, animally directed translocation of cortically injected dorsal beads that occurs in lateral regions of the yolk cortex. Furthermore, we show that such animally-directed movement along the lateral cortex is not restricted to a single arc corresponding to the prospective dorsal region, but occur in multiple meridional arcs even in opposite regions of the embryo. Together, our results reveal a role for Grip2a function in the reorganization and bundling of microtubules at the vegetal cortex to mediate a symmetry-breaking short-range shift corresponding to the teleost cortical rotation. The slight asymmetry achieved by this directed process is subsequently amplified by a general cortical animally-directed transport mechanism that is neither dependent on hecate function nor restricted to the prospective dorsal axis.  2014 Ge et al."

The response to selection for yolk T concentrations was evaluated in downward (low egg T, LET) and upward (high egg T, HET) directions over five generations. Moreover, the correlative response of circulating sex steroids to selection was examined by a comparison of plasma T and estradiol levels between the HET and LET females. We observed a distinct pattern of the response to selection in the HET and LET lines with the stronger response occurring in the upward direction and a limited potential for selection in the downward direction. In the HET line, the population mean increased more than double as compared to the initial population but it seems to be still below its plateau. The LET line reached the selection limit in the second generation suggesting that yolk T concentrations were close to their physiological minimum. Estradiol levels were higher in the circulation of the HET than LET females without changes in plasma T concentrations underlying specific control mechanisms for yolk and plasma hormone levels."

The adaptive explanations of such allocation are often related to life-history strategies of the studied species. In some species, egg sexual size dimorphism (SSD) was suggested to promote future size differences between adults of each sex. In other species, egg SSD was invoked as an adaptive means by which a mother balances sex-specific nestling mortality. According to the first scenario, mothers should produce bigger eggs for the bigger sex, thus across species, adult SSD should be a significant positive predictor of egg SSD. Under the second scenario, mothers should produce bigger eggs for the smaller sex. If different species use contrasting strategies, then a universal expectation is that there should be a significant relationship between the magnitude of adult SSD and the magnitude of egg SSD, irrespective of the direction of those differences. Our aim was to examine whether the direction of egg SSD is predicted by the direction of adult SSD or whether degree of egg SSD is related to degree of adult SSD. To answer that question, we performed meta-analysis of 63 studies, which included information on egg SSD of 65 effect sizes from 51 avian species. We found that across species, adult SSD does not predict egg SSD. More importantly, the observed variation in effect sizes in our data set was largely explained by sampling error (variance). Although adult SSD is undoubtedly a prominent feature of birds, there is little evidence for egg SSD across avian species.  2013 European Society For Evolutionary Biology."

If female parental care, which in many species exceeds male performance, is added to these initial costs, it may be concluded that females contribute more to reproduction than males. However, this additional burden on females should reduce their survival and skew the usually equal sex ratio, but this is generally not the case. A resolution of this apparent paradox requires studies estimating the parental investments of both sexes at different stages of breeding, with particular focus on the initial reproductive stage. In the present study, egg composition and its energetic value was estimated in the Dovekie (or Little Auk, Alle alle), a seabird exhibiting bi-parental care except for the end of the chick-rearing period, when the female deserts the brood while the male continues the feeding and escorts the chick during fledging. Condition estimates (size-adjusted body mass and several hematological and biochemical parameters, including concentrations of hemoglobin, glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides, as well as the leukocyte profile) were also examined in both sexes during the prelaying, laying/relaying, and chick-rearing periods. The egg composition and its energy content indicate that the energetic demands of egg production are not as high as previously assumed, and the non-resource-based costs in females seem to be similar to those experienced by males during the mating period (nest site and/or paternity guarding). However, it was also found that females had lower body mass than males throughout the whole breeding season, suggesting overall female-biased costs of reproduction despite very similar parental performance. This suggests that females are more susceptible to the negative effects of reproduction. If so, their earlier brood desertion may be a response to the additive costs of parental investments.  2014 American Ornithologists' Union."

Thirty males and 30 females were paired either continuously (C; mates together all the time) or non-continuously (NC; pairs met only three times a week for 5 min). Separation-reunion tests evaluated parental pair bond. Egg yolk testosterone and androstenedione levels were evaluated, and the somatic and behavioural development of C and NC chicks was assessed. Our results revealed that members of C pairs were attached to their mates and, although no significant differences in androgen levels could be evidenced between egg sets, a higher proportion of C pairs' eggs were fertilized and their chicks appeared less emotive and more social.

In vertebrates, neonates or early larval forms typically exhibit ""feeding drive,"" characterized by a developmental delay in 1) responsiveness of the hypothalamus to satiety signals (e.g., leptin, melanocortins) and 2) sensitivity to environmental cues that suppress food intake. Homeostatic regulation of food intake develops once offspring transition to later life history stages when growth is slower, neuroendocrine systems are more mature, and appetite becomes more sensitive to environmental or social cues. Across vertebrate groups, there is a tremendous amount of developmental plasticity in both food intake regulation and stress responsiveness depending on the environmental conditions experienced during early life history stages or by pregnant/brooding mothers. This plasticity is mediated through the organizing effects of hormones acting on the food intake centers of the hypothalamus during development, which alter epigenetic expression of genes associated with ingestive behaviors. Research is still needed to reveal the mechanisms through which environmental conditions during development generate and maintain these epigenetic modifications within the lifespan or across generations. Furthermore, more research is needed to determine whether observed patterns of plasticity are adaptive or pathological. It is clear, however, that developmental programming of food intake has important effects on fitness, and therefore, has ecological and evolutionary implications.  2014 Elsevier Inc."

For example, maternal androgens in eggs may be beneficial to offspring growth and competitive ability, but detrimental to immunocompetence and oxidative stress. In contrast, maternal antioxidants in eggs may be beneficial if they mitigate oxidative stress and immunosuppressive effects of androgens. We investigated possible interactive effects of maternal steroids and carotenoids on aspects of offspring physiology and phenotype, by simultaneously manipulating levels of androgens (via gonadotropin-releasing hormone, GnRH-challenges) and carotenoids (via diet supplementation) in captive female Japanese quail Coturnix japonica during egg laying. Carotenoid supplementation of hens, which elevates yolk concentrations of carotenoid and vitamins A and E, enhanced egg hatching success, offspring survival to age 15 d, and size of the bursa of Fabricius in offspring. In contrast, repeated maternal GnRH challenges, which elevated yolk testosterone concentrations, enhanced offspring neonatal size, but negatively affected bursa size. However, interaction among the treatments suggests that the positive effect of maternal carotenoid supplementation on plasma bactericidal capacity was mediated by maternal GnRH challenges. Chicks originating from carotenoid-supplemented hens were less immunosuppressed than those originating from carotenoid-supplemented + GnRH-challenged hens, which were less immunosuppressed than chicks from GnRH-challenged females not supplemented with carotenoids. Females availability of carotenoid enriched diets allows them to enhance the development of offspring immune system via carotenoids and vitamins deposited in egg yolks and offset detrimental effects of androgens deposited by GnRH-challenged females.  2014 The Authors."

This needs to be disentangled when studying the ontogeny and evolution of a given behavior-e.g. via cross-fostering. But cross-fostering may change the expression of parent and offspring behaviors as they may respond to the novel environment. Furthermore, parent and offspring traits are potentially co-adjusted and cross-fostering may, therefore, introduce a costly mismatch. To study such consequences of cross-fostering, we created an experimental group (EG) of broods raised by foster parents from day 3 onwards and a control group of broods raised by their biological parents throughout. We tested offspring begging intensity in all broods and the provisioning of the EG-parents only, both on day 3 just before cross-fostering and then again on day 5. Costs were estimated in terms of growth and survival (offspring costs) and mass of a second clutch (parental costs). Offspring begging intensity varied with age, but this change was neither affected by cross-fostering per se nor by small-scale differences in parental provisioning between biological and foster parents. Similarly, the change in parental provisioning with offspring age among the EG-parents was not affected by the difference in begging between biological and foster nestlings. This lack in behavioral plasticity in response to cross-fostering did not entail costs to neither of the parties. Our results suggest a rather predetermined pattern of behavioral expression, which may be shaped by limits and costs to plasticity and/or an (apparent) lack of costs of a behavioral mismatch.  2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

For plants, parental optimism may be linked to the risk of seed production being limited by pollen receipt (pollen limitation). Here we elaborate a stochastic model of pollen limitation developed by Haig and Westoby (1988) and Burd (2008) and link it with published data on the magnitudes of prepollination costs versus postpollination costs of seed production in 80 plant species. We demonstrate that parental optimism should be expected when prepollination costs of seed production are small relative to postpollination costs. This was observed for most (62 of 80) of the plant taxa surveyed. Under parental optimism, plants overinvest in securing fertilized ovules, and consequently pollen limitation is predicted to be uncommon. However, for a sizable minority of plant species (18 of 80), prepollination costs approach or exceed postpollination costs. For these species, parental pessimism is instead optimal. Parents initiate fewer zygotes than they can usually mature, and pollen limitation is predicted to be severe. Because the relative magnitudes of prepollination and postpollination costs vary by more than 1,000- fold across plant taxa, parental outlook (optimism vs. pessimism) and levels of pollen limitation are predicted to vary widely.  2014 by The University of Chicago.

To examine these relationships, we investigated the effects of genetic selection on high (HET) and low (LET) egg testosterone content in Japanese quail on the immune system under mild food restriction. To test immune response, we examined: (1) skin swelling after subcutaneous phytohaemagglutinine injection; and (2) acute phase response in reaction to intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. Food restriction decreased body mass in comparison with ad libitum fed animals, but food restriction did not diminish the positive influence of increased maternal testosterone (mT) on body growth. Furthermore, three hours after LPS injection, plasma corticosterone levels and heterophil/lymphocyte ratio were not affected by increased mT. In fact, cell mediated immunity was enhanced in the HET as compared to the LET line. Thus, our data indicate no trade-off between growth rate and immune response in young quail hatched from eggs with high mT, even under conditions of mild food deficiency."

Nevertheless, the extensive use of precocial bird models for investigating behavioral development issues requires in depth knowledge concerning the emergence of sex differences. Here, we evaluated behavioral differences between Japanese quail chicks in relation to their sex. We know that maternal influences are strong and early social environment shapes behavioral development in this species. Therefore, we investigated the emergence of sex differences in two very different early social situations to evaluate the impact of precocial bird mothers on sex differences. We assessed behavioral differences related to sex of (1) non-brooded chicks and of (2) brooded chicks, using various ethological tests to evaluate emotional reactivity and social motivation differences related to sex. Our results show that both non-brooded and brooded chicks present behavioral differences related to sex. They differed greatly according to chicks' early experience. Sex-related differences between maternally deprived (non-brooded) chicks concerned mainly fearfulness, whereas differences between male and female brooded chicks concerned mainly their reactions to social isolation. We hypothesize that mothers attenuate sex differences related to fearfulness by being a model for responses to fear-eliciting situations and by providing a similar secure basis to both males and females. We finally propose that mothers induce differences in chicks' sociality by providing asymmetrical care toward males and females.  2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Apart from effects on growth, proactive behaviour and secondary sexual characteristics, the possible negative impacts of maternal testosterone on the immune system are often considered a limitation for its deposition. The effects of maternal testosterone can be modulated by postnatal environmental conditions, such as the availability of food resources. However, the majority of studies considering the effects of maternal testosterone on the immune system have been conducted under optimum conditions. We evaluated the influence of genetic selection for high (HET) and low (LET) egg testosterone content in Japanese quail on immune responsiveness of offspring to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation under severe protein restriction. Protein restriction negatively influenced body weight and performance in the PHA-test. We observed an increase in Cort (corticosterone) and He/Ly (heterophil/lymphocyte ratio) after LPS, while no changes occurred in total IgY levels in the protein-restricted group. HET quails showed higher body mass and total IgY levels and lower He/Ly ratio than LET quails, while the PHA index and Cort concentration did not differ between lines. No interactions were found between protein restriction and genetic line. In conclusion, the immune response was not compromised under conditions of severe protein restriction in the faster growing HET line compared with the LET line.

As a consequence, penguin chicks born late in the breeding season have little time to build-up their energy reserves before the drastic energy bottleneck they experience during winter and face greater risks of mortality than early-born chicks. Whereas it is well known that breeding adults alternate between early- and late-breeding attempts, little is known on the phenotype of early- and late-chicks, and on the potential existence of specific adaptive phenotypic responses in late-born individuals. We investigated phenotypic differences between early- and late-chicks and tested their survival correlates both before the winter and at fledgling. Chicks were sampled 10 days after hatching to measure body mass, plasma corticosterone levels, oxidative stress parameters and telomere length. Late-chicks were heavier than early-chicks at day 10. Late-chicks also had higher corticosterone and oxidative stress levels, shorter telomere lengths and suffered from higher mortality rates than early-chicks. For both early- and late-chicks, high body mass close to hatching was a strong predictor of survival up to, and over, the winter period. In late but not early-chicks, high corticosterone levels and long telomeres were significant predictors of survival up to winter and fledging, respectively. Our study provides evidence that late- and early-king penguin chicks showed marked phenotypic differences 10 days after hatching. We provide an integrative discussion on whether these differences may be adaptive or not, and to what extent they may be driven by active maternal effects, indirectly induced by environmental effects, or stem from individual differences in parental quality.  2013 British Ecological Society."

If carotenoid supplementation increases offspring growth or survival, females should preferentially allocate supplemental carotenoids to offspring rather than ornamentation. We tested whether ornamented convict cichlid (Amatitlania siquia) mothers increase carotenoid allocation to eggs with access to dietary carotenoid supplementation, and whether beneficial maternal effects of carotenoid supplementation were transferred to offspring. Maternal effects of carotenoid supplementation were found; offspring from mothers that ate carotenoids benefited in terms of growth and survival parameters compared with offspring from non-supplemented mothers. Contrary to predictions, maternal coloration was not sacrificed for fecundity: mothers maintained their coloration and integument carotenoids even though increased carotenoids in the maternal diet benefited the offspring. Furthermore, carotenoid supplementation did not increase the carotenoids deposited in eggs. This work is the first to show that indirect maternal effects of carotenoid supplementation increased the survival and growth of offspring. Indirect benefits may reduce the cost of carotenoid allocation to offspring, but the mechanism for how carotenoids support offspring development is still unknown.  2013 British Ecological Society."

Variance in perinatal conditions may be caused by many factors, including number of siblings of either sex, which is expected to influence individual phenotype for two complementary reasons. First, male and female offspring can differ in susceptibility to extrinsic conditions. Second, the effect that an individual has on its siblings can differ according to their sex. Yet, few studies of vertebrates and only one of birds have addressed the long-term consequences of family sex composition on offspring of either sex. We analysed the effect of brood sex composition on adult phenotype and breeding performance in the barn swallow, Hirundo rustica. Male offspring growing with more sisters had shorter wing length, an aerodynamically important trait, and tail length, a condition-dependent, sexually selected trait. In addition, tail length of females decreased with increasing brood size but more steeply so when they grew with more female siblings. Body size of females also declined with increasing brood size. Notably, breeding output of females declined with an increasing proportion of male siblings and also with increasing brood size. This study thus suggests that social environment has major consequences for phenotype and breeding performance in adulthood and that variation in brood sex composition has long-term effects which depend on the sex of the individual as well as on the specific trait considered. Hence, optimal parental sex allocation decisions depend not simply on additive fitness costs and benefits of producing males or females, but also on the long-term effects that sons and daughters exert on each other.  2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

However, few studies have measured whether these consistent differences are evident in very young animals, and whether they persist over an individual's entire lifespan. Here we investigated the begging behaviour of very young cross-fostered zebra finch nestlings and the relationship between that and adult activity levels. We found a link between the nestling activity behaviour head movements during begging, measured at just five and seven days after hatching, and adult activity levels, measured when individuals were between three and three and a half years old. Moreover, body mass was found to be negatively correlated with both nestling and adult activity levels, suggesting that individuals which carry less body fat as adults are less active both as adults and during begging as nestlings.

Not only can egg size and parental quality influence growth and survival, but each could influence the development of condition-dependent plumage coloration in offspring. The Eastern Bluebird Sialia sialis is an altricial, multi-brooded, cavity-nesting passerine in which juveniles display dichromatic UV-blue plumage. Previous research suggests that plumage coloration acts as a signal of individual quality among juvenile and adult Eastern Bluebirds. Here, we separate the effects of egg size and parental quality (defined by egg size laid) on nestling growth and plumage ornamentation by exchanging clutches of large eggs with clutches of small eggs. Nestlings were significantly larger immediately post-hatching when hatched from a large egg, but to maintain a larger size, nestlings needed to have hatched from a large egg and to have been reared by high-quality parents. Nestlings were brighter when reared by high-quality parents and this relationship was strongest later in the breeding season. Nestlings exhibited greater UV chroma if hatched early in the season, but UV chroma was not significantly affected by egg size or parental quality. These findings demonstrate varying influences of both egg size and parental quality on offspring growth and plumage ornamentation but suggest that quality of post-hatching investment is more influential than pre-hatching investment.  2014 British Ornithologists' Union."

Such lack of invertebrate studies might be due to a traditional belief that invertebrates are just 'minirobots'. Lately, studies highlighting personality differences in a range of invertebrate species have challenged this idea. However, the number of invertebrate species investigated still contrasts markedly with the effort that has been made studying vertebrates, which represent only a single subphylum. We describe how investigating proximate, evolutionary and ecological correlates of personality variation in invertebrates may broaden our understanding of personality variation in general. In our opinion, personality studies on invertebrates are much needed, because invertebrates exhibit a range of aspects in their life histories, social and sexual behaviours that are extremely rare or absent in most studied vertebrates, but that offer new avenues for personality research. Examples are complete metamorphosis, male emasculation during copulation, asexual reproduction, eusociality and parasitism. Further invertebrate personality studies could enable a comparative approach to unravel how past selective forces have driven the evolution of personality differences. Finally, we point out the advantages of studying personality variation in many invertebrate species, such as easier access to relevant data on proximate and ultimate factors, arising from easy maintenance, fast life cycles and short generation times.  2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

Here, we explore patterns of hatching order and fitness-related traits in the Pukeko Porphyrio melanotus melanotus, a cooperatively breeding bird that lives in stable social groups that form linear dominance hierarchies. Pukeko groups sometimes contain two breeding females that lay eggs in the same nest (joint-laying). Thus, competition between nest-mates can influence the relative fitness of each laying female. We show that in both single-clutch and joint-clutch nests, earlier-hatched Pukeko chicks grow faster and survive better than later-hatched brood-mates. Moreover, earlier-hatched chicks achieve higher dominance ranks as adults, making this study one of the first to find a relationship between hatching order and adult dominance in wild birds. Finally, we show that in groups with two breeding females, the chicks of the primary female hatch earlier than the chicks of the secondary female. As a result, the offspring of the primary female may be at a competitive advantage, which could have important implications for social dynamics in this species.  2014 British Ornithologists' Union."

Yolk mass, although poorly studied, is the source of nutrients for the embryo, so its mass should be more influential for the nestlings than total egg mass. We used a technique that allowed us to measure yolk size without destroying the eggs. We studied yolk mass in 212 eggs of White-rumped Swallows (Tachycineta leucorrhoa) and found that yolk mass was influenced by laying order, with last laid eggs having heavier yolks than first laid eggs, and the pattern was consistent with egg mass variation. Food abundance also affected yolk mass: when insect availability was high the yolks were heavier. We conclude that embryos in the last laid eggs have more resources from which to develop, and excluding food abundance, neither environmental conditions nor female's condition affected yolk mass. We encourage other researchers to study yolk mass given that multiple variables affected total egg mass.  Copyright 2014 by the Wilson Ornithological Society."

The red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus is one species that has contributed widely to this field since the 1950s. This paper reviews the trajectory and profound impact that these studies have had. Red grouse research has combined long-term studies of marked individuals with demographic studies over wide geographical areas and replicated individual- and population-level manipulations. A main focus has been on understanding the causes of population cycles in red grouse, and in particular the relative importance of intrinsic (behaviour) and extrinsic (climate, food limitation and parasite) mechanisms. Separate studies conducted in different regions initially proposed either the nematode parasite Trichostrongylus tenuis or changes in male aggressiveness in autumn as drivers of population cycles. More recent experiments suggest that parasites are not a necessary cause for cycles and have highlighted that behavioural and parasite-mediated mechanisms are interrelated. Long-term experiments show that parasites and aggressiveness interact. Two outstanding questions remain to be tested experimentally. First, what intrinsic mechanism causes temporal variation in patterns of male aggressiveness? The current favoured mechanism is related to patterns of kin structuring although there are alternative hypotheses. Second, how do the dual, interacting mechanisms, affect population dynamics? Red grouse studies have had an important impact on the field of population ecology, in particular through highlighting: (1) the impact of parasites on populations; (2) the role of intrinsic mechanisms in cyclic dynamics and (3) the need to consider multiple, interacting mechanisms.  2013 British Ecological Society."

Here, we model parent-offspring conflict in the presence of condition-dependent sex allocation, where the environment has sex-specific fitness consequences. Additionally, one sex is assumed to be more costly to produce than the other, which leads offspring to favor a sex ratio less biased toward the cheaper sex in comparison to the sex ratio favored by mothers. The scope for parent-offspring conflict depends on the relative frequency of both environments: when one environment is less common than the other, parent-offspring conflict can be reduced or even entirely absent, despite a biased population sex ratio. The model shows that conflict-driven invasions of condition-independent sex factors (e.g., sex chromosomes) result either in the loss of condition-dependent sex allocation, or, interestingly, lead to stable mixtures of condition-dependent and condition-independent sex factors. The latter outcome corresponds to empirical observations in which sex chromosomes are present in organisms with environment-dependent sex determination. Finally, conflict can also favor errors in environmental perception, potentially resulting in the loss of condition-dependent sex allocation without genetic changes to sex-determining loci.  2014 The Society for the Study of Evolution."

We modelled a two-generation pedigree with the animal model to distinguish additive genetic variance from maternal and common environmental effects. The results show that FMR is significantly heritable, with additive genetic variance accounting for about 40% of total phenotypic variance; thus, FMR has the potential to respond to selection on dispersal capacity. Maternal influences on flight metabolism were negligible. Heritability of flight metabolism was context dependent, as in stressful thermal conditions, environmentally induced variation dominated over additive genetic effects. There was no heritability in RMR, which was instead strongly influenced by maternal effects.

Specifically, it has been suggested that dietderived carotenoids can play a key role in physiological functions because of their antioxidant and immunostimulant properties. However, their role as antioxidants remains controversial. Additionally, it is also unclear whether oxidative stress mediates their immunostimulatory effects. In this field study, we separately supplemented yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) chicks with two carotenoids (lutein and -carotene) with different molecular structures and different transformation pathways into other oxidative forms of carotenoids. We quantified their effect on the oxidative status and the immune response of chicks before and after an oxidative challenge with paraquat, a pro-oxidant molecule. Prior to oxidative challenge, none of the carotenoid treatments affected the oxidative status of chicks, but they enhanced the inflammatory response to an antigen compared with controls. The oxidative challenge enhanced plasma vitamin E levels (but not in -carotene-supplemented chicks) and the antioxidant capacity in the short term. Interestingly, luteinsupplemented chicks showed lower oxidative damage to proteins than non-lutein-supplemented chicks. After the oxidative challenge, the positive effect of carotenoid supplementation on the immune response disappeared. Thus, these results suggest differential effects of two carotenoids with different molecular structures on the oxidative status. Lutein but not -carotene helps to combat oxidative damage after a free-radical exposure. Additionally, the results indicate that the immunostimulatory effects of carotenoids are linked to oxidative status during early life.  2014. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd."

Components of begging calls that are sensitive to food deprivation may honestly signal need, whereas other components may be associated with individual-specific attributes that do not change with time such as identity, sex, absolute age and hierarchy. In a sib-sib communication system where barn owl (Tyto alba) nestlings vocally negotiate priority access to food resources, we show that calls have individual signatures that are used by nestlings to recognize which siblings are motivated to compete, even if most vocalization features vary with hunger level. Nestlings were more identifiable when food-deprived than food-satiated, suggesting that vocal identity is emphasized when the benefit of winning a vocal contest is higher. In broods where siblings interact iteratively, we speculate that individual-specific signature permits siblings to verify that the most vocal individual in the absence of parents is the one that indeed perceived the food brought by parents. Individual recognition may also allow nestlings to associate identity with individual-specific characteristics such as position in the within-brood dominance hierarchy. Calls indeed revealed age hierarchy and to a lower extent sex and absolute age. Using a cross-fostering experimental design, we show that most acoustic features were related to the nest of origin (but not the nest of rearing), suggesting a genetic or an early developmental effect on the ontogeny of vocal signatures. To conclude, our study suggests that sibling competition has promoted the evolution of vocal behaviours that signal not only hunger level but also intrinsic individual characteristics such as identity, family, sex and age.  2013 European Society For Evolutionary Biology."

Hormone-signaling pathways respond to an organism's external environment to mediate developmental stage-specific malleability in phenotypes, so that environmental variation experienced at different stages of development has distinct effects on an organism's phenotype. Studies of hormone-signaling are therefore playing a central role in efforts to understand how plastic phenotypic responses to environmental variation are generated during development. But, how do adaptive, hormonally mediated phenotypes evolve if the individual signaling components (hormones, conversion enzymes, membrane transporters, and receptors) that comprise any hormone-signaling pathway show expressional flexibility in response to environmental variation? What relevance do these components hold as molecular targets for selection to couple or decouple correlated hormonally mediated traits? This article explores how studying the endocrine underpinnings of phenotypic plasticity in an ecologically relevant context can provide insights into these, and other, crucial questions into the role of phenotypic plasticity in evolution, including how plasticity itself evolves. These issues are discussed in the light of investigations into how thyroid hormones mediate morphological plasticity in Death Valley's clade of pupfishes (Cyprinodon spp.). Findings from this work with pupfish illustrate that the study of hormone-signaling from an ecological perspective can reveal how phenotypic plasticity contributes to the generation of phenotypic novelty, as well as how physiological mechanisms developmentally link an organism's phenotype to its environmental experiences.  2014  The Author 2014.

One reason why eggs fail to hatch is that they are not fertilized, which may be because they receive insufficient sperm. In most passerines, copulation declines in frequency or ceases altogether after the laying of the first egg, so eggs laid late in the laying sequence may be more likely to remain unfertilized. We tested this prediction in the Blue Tit Cyanistes caeruleus, a species in which late-laid eggs are particularly likely to be sperm-limited because it lays the largest clutch of any passerine. We assessed whether: (1) eggs laid later in the laying sequence are more likely to fail to develop, (2) larger clutches are more likely to contain undeveloped eggs, (3) the number of sperm present on the perivitelline layers of each egg decreases across the laying sequence and (4) the number of sperm present on the perivitelline layers of freshly laid eggs sampled from active clutches predicts the proportion of eggs that develop in the remainder of the clutch. The occurrence of undeveloped eggs was not related to their position in the laying sequence, nor was it related to clutch size. Within a clutch, sperm number did not differ between an egg laid early and an egg laid towards the end of the laying sequence. Moreover, there was no indication that the proportion of undeveloped eggs in a clutch correlated with the number of sperm in a subset of eggs from that clutch, or that females laying larger clutches had stored more sperm. In summary, we found no evidence that Blue Tit eggs fail to hatch because they receive insufficient sperm.  2013 British Ornithologists' Union."

Because females often express detectable levels of testosterone, testosterone has been suggested to also play a role in the modulation of secondary sexual traits in females. Previous comparative analyses in birds and fish demonstrated a relationship between male-to-female testosterone ratios and the degree of sexual dimorphism. Furthermore, female maximum testosterone was related to mating system and coloniality. Here, we reevaluate these previous ideas using phylogenetic analyses and effect size measures for the relationship between birds' male-to-female maximum testosterone levels. Further, we investigate the seasonal androgen response of female birds (the difference from baseline to maximum testosterone), which in males is strongly related to mating system. We could not confirm a relationship between male-to-female testosterone, maximum female testosterone, or the seasonal androgen response of females with any life-history parameter. We conclude that the expectation that testosterone regulates traits in females in a similar manner as in males should be reconsidered. This expectation may be partially due to hormone manipulation studies using pharmacological doses of testosterone that had similar effects in females than in males but may be of limited importance for the physiological range of testosterone concentrations occurring within ecological and evolutionary contexts. Thus, the assumption that circulating testosterone should covary with ecologically relevant secondary sexual traits in females may be misleading: selection pressures on females differ from those on males and females may regulate behavior differently.  2014 The Author."

Divergent selection, however, has never been analyzed by the capture-recapture approach. Most reported examples of differences between urban and nonurban animals reflect behavioral plasticity rather than divergent selection. The aim of this paper was to use a capture-recapture approach to test the hypothesis that divergent selection can also drive local adaptation in urban habitats. We focused on the size of the black breast stripe (i.e., tie width) of the great tit (Parus major), a sexual ornament used in mate choice. Urban great tits display smaller tie sizes than forest birds. Because tie size is mostly genetically determined, it could potentially respond to selection. We analyzed capture/recapture data of male great tits in Barcelona city (N = 171) and in a nearby (7 km) forest (N = 324) from 1992 to 2008 using MARK. When modelling recapture rate, we found it to be strongly influenced by tie width, so that both for urban and forest habitats, birds with smaller ties were more trap-shy and more cautious than their larger tied counterparts. When modelling survival, we found that survival prospects in forest great tits increased the larger their tie width (i.e., directional positive selection), but the reverse was found for urban birds, with individuals displaying smaller ties showing higher survival (i.e., directional negative selection). As melanin-based tie size seems to be related to personality, and both are heritable, results may be explained by cautious personalities being favored in urban environments. More importantly, our results show that divergent selection can be an important mechanism in local adaptation to urban habitats and that capture-recapture is a powerful tool to test it.  2014 The Authors."

However, studies suggest that turtles with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) are cryptically GSD and possess sex chromosomes. Here, we test this hypothesis in painted turtles Chrysemys picta (TSD), using comparativegenome-hybridization (CGH), a technique known to detect morphologically indistinguishable sex chromosomes in other turtles and reptiles. Our results show no evidence for the existence of sex chromosomes in painted turtles. While it remains plausible that cryptic sex chromosomes may exist in TSD turtles that are characterized by minor genetic differences that cannot be detected at the resolution of CGH, previous attempts have failed to identify sex-specific markers. Genomic sequencing should prove useful in providing conclusive evidence in this regard. If such efforts uncover sex chromosomes in TSD turtles, it may reveal the existence of a fundamental constraint for the evolution of a full spectrum of sex determination (from pure GSD to pure TSD) that is predicted theoretically. Finding sex chromosomes in ESD organisms would question whether pure ESD mechanisms exist at all in nature, or whether those systems currently considered pure ESD simply await the characterization of an underlying GSD architecture.  2014 S.

Ornament development typically involves deeply conserved developmental genes. Their expression is modified by pre-existing sexually dimorphic signals, such as hormones in vertebrates or doublesex gene products in insects. Changes in dosage and binding affinities in these systems apparently allow frequent switches between sexually dimorphic and monomorphic ornament expression. However, early-developing ornaments may be difficult to modulate, as this would result in severe pleiotropic effects.

We tested the differential allocation hypothesis in the swordtail fish Xiphophorus multilineatus, where males have genetically influenced (patroclinous inheritance) alternative mating tactics (ARTs) maintained by a tradeoff between being more attractive to females (mature later as larger courting males) and a higher probability of reaching sexual maturity (mature earlier as smaller sneaker males). Males in X. multilineatus do not provide parental care or other resources to the offspring. Allelic variation and copy number of the Mc4R gene on the Y-chromosome influences the size differences between males, however there is no variation in this gene on the X-chromosome. Therefore, to determine if mothers invested more in offspring of the larger courter males, we examined age to sexual maturity for daughters. We confirmed a tradeoff between number of offspring and female offspring's age to sexual maturity, corroborating that there is a cost to reproduction. In addition, the ART of their fathers significantly influenced the age at which daughters reached sexual maturity, suggesting increased maternal investment to daughters of courter males. The differential allocation we detected was influenced by how long the wild-caught mother had been in the laboratory, as there was a brood order by father genotype (ART) interaction. These results suggest that females can adjust their reproductive investment strategy, and that differential allocation is context specific. We hypothesize that one of two aspects of laboratory conditions produced this shift: increased female condition due to higher quality diet, and/or assessment of future mating opportunities due to isolation from males.  2013 Rios-Cardenas et al."

Less is known about maternal investment in eggshells, especially in pigments. The two main eggshell pigments may possess opposite antioxidant properties: protoporphyrin (brown) is a pro-oxidant, whereas biliverdin (blue-green) is an antioxidant. In Japanese quail, we know that the deposition of both pigments is related to female body condition. Thus, a chronic stress response may be reflected in eggshell coloration. Using female Japanese quails that lay brown-spotted eggs, we explored whether physiological exposure to corticosterone induces a change in female basal stress and antioxidant factors, and eggshell pigment concentration, spectrophotometric reflectance, and maculation coverage. We supplemented adult females over a 2 week period with either peanut oil (control) or corticosterone (treatment). We collected pre- and post-supplementation eggs and analysed the effect of corticosterone treatment on female physiology and eggshell appearance parameters. Except for corticosterone-fed birds which laid eggs with brighter spots, supplementation had no significant effect on female physiology or eggshell pigment concentration, reflectance and maculation. The change in eggshell spot brightness was not detected by a photoreceptor noise-limited color opponent model of avian visual perception. Our data confirms that eggshell reflectance in spotted eggs varies over the laying sequence, and spot reflectance may be a key factor that is affected by females CORT exposure, even if the changes are not detected by an avian visual model.  2013 Duval et al."

A total of 60 Ross broiler breeder hens at 29 weeks of age were randomly divided into 4 groups with 15 hens each. The first group served as the control. The rest of the hens were given 1, 1.5 or 2 mg of CORT/hen/d (CORT1, CORT1.5 and CORT2, respectively) for 7 d. Concentrations of yolk CORT, plasma uric acid, glucose, cholesterol, creatine kinase, heterophil (H):lymphocyte (L) ratio and duration of tonic immobility (TI) were measured at d 3, 5 and 7 of CORT supplementation. The same measurements were repeated at 3, 5 and 7 d after CORT was withdrawn from the diet.3. There were no significant CORT dose effect on yolk CORT and plasma glucose concentrations. Higher plasma uric acid and H:L ratio was obtained for CORT1.5 and CORT2 than for CORT1. From 3 to 7 d of dietary CORT supplementation, yolk CORT and plasma uric acid concentrations and H:L ratio increased whereas plasma glucose concentration decreased. After CORT was withdrawn from the diet, the H:L ratio remained elevated. The duration of TI and plasma creatine kinase concentration did not change during and after CORT supplementation.4. Yolk CORT concentration was correlated with plasma uric acid concentration during CORT supplementation.5. The results suggest that dietary CORT supplementation could be used as a stress model and to evaluate hormone-mediated maternal effects in broiler breeder hens.  2013 British Poultry Science Ltd."

In placental vertebrates, it is known that maternally derived steroids are metabolized during development via the sulfonation pathway. We used eggs from the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta) to determine whether the same metabolic pathway is used to metabolize maternally derived steroids in an oviparous vertebrate. To examine the relationship between estradiol and estrogen sulfates during development, levels of maternally derived estradiol were compared with levels of estradiol sulfate, estrone sulfate, and estriol sulfate at oviposition and after 20 days of embryonic development. Estrone sulfate was the only detectable estrogen sulfate. At oviposition, levels of both estradiol and estrone sulfate varied seasonally with clutches from later in the nesting season having significantly higher concentrations of both steroids. Levels of estrone sulfate increased during development, demonstrating that the sulfonation of maternally derived steroids occurs in oviparous vertebrates as well as in placental vertebrates. We also found that exogenous estrone sulfate increases the production of female hatchlings, thereby demonstrating the ability of this metabolite to influence embryonic development. To examine the role of sulfonation in the metabolism of maternal progesterone and testosterone, we characterized the metabolic fate of both steroids by applying tritiated forms of each steroid at oviposition and characterizing metabolites after 20 days of incubation. Similar to what was demonstrated for estradiol, both progesterone and testosterone are converted to sulfonated metabolites during embryonic development. These data suggest that steroid sulfates, both those that are maternally derived and those resulting from the metabolism of maternal steroids, are a key component of the mechanism underlying steroid-mediated maternal effects.

A4 or vehicle substance (control), to examine the differential ability of these steroids to influence nestling development. We found that the duration of the embryonic period was increased by T, and less so by A4, but not by the combination T. +. A4. Body condition was reduced in all experimental treatments where A4 was present, particularly so in the combination T. +. A4. Tarsus length was increased in males by A4, and in a lower degree by T, whereas the combination T. +. A4 inhibited growth. However, these differences in tarsus length between groups disappeared at the end of the nestling period. Cell-mediated immune responsiveness was marginally affected by the interaction between treatment and sex. These patterns suggest that in this species, T has a stronger influence during embryo development than A4, whereas during nestling development the capacities of both androgens to influence growth are similar. The combination T. +. A4 showed non-additive effects, suggesting either some kind of inhibition between the two androgens, or else an excessive effect due to a bell-shaped pattern of response.

The embryonic developmental process has been shown to begin in the oviduct such that the embryo has attained either the blastodermal and/or gastrulation stage of development at oviposition. Bird embryos can be affected by ""maternal effects,"" and by environmental conditions during the pre-incubation and incubation periods. ""Maternal effects"" has been described as an evolutionary mechanism that has provided the mother, by hormonal deposition into the yolk, with the potential to proactively influence the development of her progeny by exposing them to her particular hormonal pattern in such a manner as to influence their ability to cope with the expected wide range of environmental conditions that may occur posthatching. Another important aspect of ""maternal effects"" is the effect of the maternal nutrient intake on progeny traits. From a commercial broiler chicken production perspective, it has been established that greater cumulative nutrient intake by the hen during her pullet rearing phase prior to photostimulation resulted in faster growing broiler progeny. Generally, maternal effects on progeny, which have both a genetic and an environmental component represented by yolk hormones deposition and embryo nutrient utilization, have an important effect on the development of a wide range of progeny traits. Furthermore, commercial embryo development during pre-incubation storage and incubation, as well as during incubation per se has been shown to largely depend upon temperature, while other environmental factors that include egg position during storage, and the amount of H2O and CO2 lost by the egg and the subsequent effect on albumen pH and height during storage have become important environmental factors to be considered for successful embryogenesis under commercial conditions. Manipulating environmental temperature during the period of egg storage, during the intermediate pre-incubation period, and incubation period per se has been found to significantly affect embryo development, hatching progress, chick quality at hatching, and chick development post-hatching. These temperature manipulations have also been shown to affect the acquisition of thermotolerance to subsequent post-hatching thermal challenge. This chapter will focus on: a. ""maternal effects"" on embryo and posthatching development; b. environmental effects during the postovipositional period of egg storage, the intermediate pre-incubation period, and incubation period per se on chick embryogenesis and subsequent post-hatching growth and development; and c. effects of temperature manipulations during the pre-incubation and incubation periods on acquisition of thermotolerance and development of secondary sexual characteristics in broiler chickens.  2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc."

Birds are especially intriguing to study this phenomenon as avian females are the heterogametic sex (ZW); therefore sex determination might be under direct control of the mother. Avian sex ratios vary in relation to environmental or maternal condition, which can also affect the production of maternal steroids that in turn are involved in reproduction and accumulate in the developing follicle before meiosis. As the proximate mechanisms underlying biased primary sex ratio are largely elusive, we explored how, and to what extent, maternal steroid hormones may be involved in affecting primary or secondary sex ratio in clutches of various species of pigeons. First we demonstrated a clear case of seasonal change in sex ratio in first eggs both in the Rock Pigeon (Columba livia) and in a related species, the Wood Pigeon (Columba palumbus), both producing clutches of two eggs. In the Homing Pigeon (Columba livia domestica), domesticated from the Rock Pigeon, testosterone treatment of breeding females induced a clear male bias, while corticosterone induced a female bias in first eggs and we argue that this is in line with sex allocation theory. We next analyzed treatment effects on follicle formation, yolk mass, and yolk hormones, the latter both pre- and post-ovulatory, in order to test a diversity of potential mechanisms related to both primary and secondary sex ratio manipulation. We conclude that maternal plasma hormone levels may affect several pre-ovulatory mechanisms affecting primary sex ratio, whereas egg hormones are probably involved in secondary sex ratio manipulation only.

Based on differential allocation theory that predicts biased reproductive investment of females depending on the attractiveness of mates, a number of previous studies have shown that egg production is related in various ways to ornamental sexual traits of males, but evidence for behavioural sexual traits is less abundant. In this study we examine such maternal effects in relation to birdsong. Because the Bengalese finch is a monomorphic songbird, courtship song serves a key role in mate choice. To take into account individual female differences in egg production performance, we sequentially paired nave, captive, female Bengalese finches to two different males, and investigated if their reproductive investment (clutch size, egg mass and hatchling sex ratio) was related to the song traits of their mates. We found that clutch size and egg mass were highly repeatable within individual females while sex ratio was not. Despite the inflexibility of egg mass within each female, egg mass increased when females were mated to males with longer songs. In addition, we found a non-significant weak tendency toward male-biased sex ratio in relation to longer song duration of mates. Our findings suggest that females mated to better mates adjusted their reproductive investment by producing heavier eggs and possibly offspring of the more costly sex.  2013 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden."

It provides the developmental environment for the embryo and nestling thereby affecting their quality and survival. Nests are often constructed by the male and nest quality, elaboration, and ornamentation vary among males in a species. Therefore, male nest-building behaviour is likely under sexual selection and females may use male nest-building behaviour and nest features as cues in mate choice and their own reproductive investment. We tested this hypothesis in European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). Male starlings present green plants to females during their courtship display and furbish their nests with variable quantities of fresh green plants. The highest frequency of plant incorporation into the nest occurs during pair formation and oogenesis. We determined nest composition and measured yolk testosterone concentrations in eggs. Yolk testosterone concentrations were positively correlated with the amount of green plant material in nests. Because males use green nest material in courtship and green nest material positively affects nestlings' development, we suggest that female European starlings use male nest-building effort, ritualised courtship display of green plants, and nest characteristics in mate choice, and adjust yolk testosterone levels in the eggs to the quality of the nest to optimise offspring growth."

We tested whether female lekking lance-tailed manakins (Chiroxiphia lanceolata) adjust offspring sex and egg volume in response to mate attractiveness (annual reproductive success, ARS), heterozygosity and relatedness. Across 968 offspring, the probability of being male decreased with increasing parental relatedness but not father ARS or heterozygosity. This correlation tended to diminish with increasing lay-date. Across 162 offspring, egg volume correlated negatively with parental relatedness and varied with lay-date, but was unrelated to father ARS or heterozygosity. Offspring sex and egg size were unrelated to maternal age. Comparisons of maternal half-siblings in broodswith no mortality produced similar results, indicating differential allocation rather than covariation between female quality and relatedness or sex-specific inbreeding depression in survival. As males suffer greater inbreeding depression, overproducing females after mating with related males may reduce fitness costs of inbreeding in a system with no inbreeding avoidance, while biasing the sex of outbred offspring towards males may maximize fitness via increased mating success of outbred sons.  2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

To investigate these matters, corticosterone and gestagens were measured in individual fractions of high-performance liquid-chromatographic separations of chicken albumen and yolk of red jungle fowl. Similarly, yolk extracts of hens with corticosterone-releasing implants or placebos were analysed to assess the impact of elevated plasma corticosterone concentrations on authentic yolk corticosterone levels. We also compared the results of a previously used corticosterone enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to those from a commercial radioimmunoassay (RIA) kit. The analytical validations of chicken albumen, bankiva yolk and yolks from hens with or without artificially elevated plasma corticosterone levels indicated that the main share of the immunoreactivity measured via corticosterone immunoassays was caused by substances other than authentic corticosterone. In albumen, the concentration of authentic corticosterone was below the detection limit. Analysis of bankiva yolk revealed three major gestagen peaks with concentrations of up to 2000 ng per fraction and a corticosterone peak of about 0.8 ng per fraction. Both corticosterone assays found a slightly higher corticosterone peak in a corticosterone-implanted hen's yolk (EIA: 0.7 ng; RIA: 0.5 ng per fraction) compared to the shamtreated female (EIA: 0.5 ng; RIA: 0.2 ng per fraction) but both antibodies also bound to several other substances, presumably gestagens.

However, yolk A4 is deposited in substantially higher concentrations than T, binds only weakly to the androgen receptor, and is readily converted into either T or estrone by steroidogenic enzymes present during embryonic development. Thus it may not be appropriate to assume that A4 has the same effect as T. In addition, A4's metabolic fate is likely to differ between females and males. The goals of this study were to examine the sex-specific uptake and metabolism of yolk A4 and consequences of elevated levels of yolk A4 on development and behavior of domestic chicks.

We examined the ontogeny of the stress response in the semi-precocial ring-billed gull ( Larus delawarensis). At hatch, 10, and 20. days post-hatching, chicks underwent a standardized handling stress protocol, with blood samples taken within 3. min of, and 30. min after, initial disturbance. Levels of corticosterone (CORT), natural antibodies (NAb), complement activity, and immunoglobulins (IgY) were assessed in plasma samples. In contrast with altricial species, ring-billed gull chicks had detectible CORT levels at hatch, and were able to mount a stress response. At all ages, acute handling stress depressed NAb levels and complement-mediated lysis, but not IgY levels. IgY levels were higher in two chick broods than three chick broods, suggesting levels are determined in part by resource dependence.

Maternal experience with predators, for example, can have lifelong consequences for offspring traits, including fitness. Previous work in threespine sticklebacks showed that females exposed to simulated predation risk produced eggs with higher cortisol content and offspring with altered anti-predator behavior. However, it is unknown whether this maternal effect is mediated via the offspring glucocorticoid stress response and if it is retained over the entire lifetime of offspring. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that maternal exposure to simulated predation risk has long-lasting effects on the cortisol response to simulated predation risk in stickleback offspring. We measured circulating concentrations of cortisol before (baseline), 15. min after, and 60. min after exposure to a simulated predation risk. We compared adult offspring of predator-exposed mothers and control mothers in two different social environments (alone or in a group). Relative to baseline, offspring plasma cortisol was highest 15. min after exposure to simulated predation risk and decreased after 60. min. Offspring of predator-exposed mothers differed in the cortisol response to simulated predation risk compared to offspring of control mothers. In general, females had higher cortisol than males, and fish in a group had lower cortisol than fish that were by themselves. The buffering effect of the social environment did not differ between maternal treatments or between males and females. Altogether the results show that while a mother's experience with simulated predation risk might affect the physiological response of her adult offspring to a predator, sex and social isolation have much larger effects on the stress response to predation risk in sticklebacks.  2013 Elsevier Inc."

We incubated eggs of an Australian lizard with temperature-dependent sex determination under three thermal regimes; some eggs were given an aromatase inhibitor to produce sons at temperatures that usually produce only daughters. Offspring were raised to maturity and freely interbred within field enclosures. After incubating eggs of the subsequent generation and assigning parentage, we found that the developmental temperature experienced by a male significantly influences the sex of his future progeny. This transgenerational effect on sex ratio may reflect an epigenetic influence on paternally-inherited DNA. Clearly, sex determination in reptiles is far more complex than is currently envisaged."

Embryonic transcription begins during the maternal to zygotic transfer of control in directing development. This transition occurs at species-specific times after one or several rounds of blastomere cleavage and is essential for normal development. However, even after activation of the embryonic genome, successful development relies on stored maternal components without which embryos fail to progress beyond initial cell divisions.

Eggshell coloration is predominately caused by pigment deposition; one such pigment is the antioxidant biliverdin, and deposition of biliverdin into eggshells may be costly to mothers due to depletion of their antioxidant reserves. Previous work has shown that dietary supplementation during laying with another type of antioxidant - carotenoid pigments - induces females to produce more biliverdin-rich eggshells. However, the impact of pre-laying nutrition - including the developmental period early in life - on eggshell coloration has not been investigated. Here, we raised female mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) from hatching, supplemented their diets with carotenoids during early-, mid- or late-developmental periods, and at adulthood measured female circulating carotenoid levels, yolk carotenoid levels, and eggshell coloration. We found that carotenoid supplementation during the late stages of development (transitional period from juvenile to adult plumage) promoted the laying of eggs with more biliverdin-rich eggshells. Independent of developmental dietary treatment, females with higher circulating carotenoid levels at the time of egg laying produced more biliverdin-rich eggshells and more carotenoid-rich yolks. When controlling for female identity, we found that more biliverdin-rich eggshells were associated with more carotenoid-rich, but smaller, yolks. We also detected a laying order effect; later-laid eggs had larger, less carotenoid-rich yolks and less biliverdin-rich eggshells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that eggshell coloration reveals carotenoid status of both mothers and yolks and that diet quality more than 1month prior to laying can affect eggshell coloration in a waterfowl species. As mallards are considered to be capital breeders in terms of lipid stores, our findings provide a new developmental perspective on the carryover of lipid-soluble and antioxidant nutrient reserves for breeding.  2013 The Authors."

By contrast, the information conveyed by female ornaments is less well understood. Here, we investigated the links between female ornaments and maternal effects. In birds, an important maternal effect is the transmission of resources, such as carotenoids, into egg yolk. Carotenoids are pigments with antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties that are crucial for females and developing offspring. In blue tits, we evaluated whether ultraviolet (UV)/blue and yellow feather colouration signals a female's capacity to allocate carotenoids to egg yolk. Because mounting an immune response is costly and trade-offs are more detectable under harsh conditions, we challenged the immune system of females before laying and examined the carotenoid level of their eggs afterward. A positive association between feather carotenoid chroma and egg carotenoid level would be expected if yellow colouration signals basal immunity. Alternatively, if female colouration more generally reflects maternal capacity to invest in reproduction under challenging conditions, then other components of colouration (i.e. yellow brightness and UV/blue colouration) could be linked to maternal capacity to invest in eggs. No association between egg carotenoid levels and UV/blue crown colouration or female yellow chest chroma was found; the latter result suggests that yellow colouration does not signal immune capacity at laying in this species. By contrast, we found that, among females that mounted a detectable response to the vaccine, those with brighter yellow chests transmitted more carotenoids into their eggs. This result suggests yellow brightness signals maternal capacity to invest in reproduction under challenging conditions, and that male blue tits may benefit directly from choosing brighter yellow females.  2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

As such, a large number of studies have attempted to evaluate potential predictors of juvenile survival in birds, especially predictors related to parental care. Lack's hypothesis linking body reserves accumulated from parental care to the survival of naive juveniles has organized much of this research, but various other predictors have also been investigated and received some support. We reviewed the literature in this area and identified a variety of methodological problems that obscure interpretation of the body of results. Most studies adopted statistical techniques that missed the opportunities to (1) evaluate the relative importance of several predictors, (2) control the confounding effect of correlation among predictor variables, and (3) exploit the information content of collinearity by evaluating indirect (via correlation) as well as direct effects of potential predictorson juvenile survival. Ultimately, we concluded that too few reliable studies exist to allow robust evaluations of any hypothesis regarding juvenile survival in birds. We used path analysis to test potential predictors of juvenile survival of 2,631 offspring from seven annual cohorts of a seabird, the Nazca Booby (Sula granti). Fledging age was the most important predictor of juvenile survival: fast-growing offspring survived best, when all other variables were held constant. Offspring sex was the next most important predictor, with juvenile males (the smaller sex) surviving better thanfemales. Hatching day, an index of body weight, and wing length also showed important predictive ability, but cohort size, culmen length, and an index of clutch size and hatching success did not. Nestling growth was compromised under poor rearing conditions: overall weight fell, the number of days needed to reach fledging status increased, and the growth of some structures, but not others, was reduced. These effects were more pronounced in females, and the higher juvenile mortality of females accounts for most of the male bias in the adult sex ratio and its attendant ""mate rotation"" mating system in this population. Most previous studies did not evaluate sex as a potential predictor of juvenile survival. Had we omitted sex from our models, we would have made two erroneous conclusions: that weight did not influence juvenile survival, and that small structural size enhance edit.

To predict micro-evolution in this trait, it is crucial to properly estimate its heritability. Heritabilities are often estimated from pedigreed wild populations. As these are observational data, it leaves the possibility that the resemblance between related individuals is not due to shared genes but to ontogenetic effects; when the environment for the offspring provided by early laying pairs differs from that by late pairs and the laying dates of these offspring when they reproduce themselves is affected by this environment, this may lead to inflated heritability estimates. Using simulation studies, we first tested whether and how much such an early environmental effect can inflate heritability estimates from animal models, and we showed that pedigree structure determines by how much early environmental effects inflate heritability estimates. We then used data from a wild population of great tits (Parus major) to compare laying dates of females born early in the season in first broods and from sisters born much later, in second broods. These birds are raised under very different environmental conditions but have the same genetic background. The laying dates of first and second brood offspring do not differ when they reproduce themselves, clearly showing that ontogenetic effects are very small and hence, family resemblance in timing is due to genes. This finding is essential for the interpretation of the heritabilities reported from wild populations and for predicting micro-evolution in response to climate change.  2013 European Society For Evolutionary Biology."

Prior to incubation, eggs were either injected with an oil vehicle or 5 ng testosterone. At either 17 or 18 days post-hatch, several oxidative stress markers were assessed from blood taken before and after a 20 min acute stressor, as well as following a 25 min recovery from the stressor.

Almost all of these studies have used mammalian species, but more recently oviparous species in which the embryo develops outside the mother's body have received more attention. These new models facilitate disentangling of the underlying mechanism due to the accessibility of the prenatal environment, the egg. Studies in birds have found that maternal stress during egg formation induces phenotypic alterations in the offspring that hatch from these eggs. However, different offspring traits have been measured in different studies and potential underlying mechanisms are barely addressed. In this study we experimentally manipulated maternal corticosterone levels in laying hens. We found that mothers with experimentally elevated plasma corticosterone levels produced offspring that are smaller at hatching, less competitive, less fearful, have lower immunocompetence and higher plasma testosterone levels, as well as an alteration of visually guided behavioural lateralization. Earlier we have showed that eggs produced by these corticosterone treated mothers were lighter and contained lower concentrations of testosterone and progesterone in the yolk. While yolk hormones showed no correlation with any offspring traits, egg mass correlated positively with offspring's body mass from hatching until 10. days of age and hatching mass correlated positively with the offspring's ability to compete for food, indicating that prenatal under nutrition might mediate some effects of maternal stress.  2013 Elsevier Inc."

The mechanisms by which maternal sqt/nodal RNA is localized and regulated have been unclear. Here, we show that maternal control of Nodal signaling via the conserved Y box-binding protein 1 (Ybx1) is essential. We identified Ybx1 via a proteomic screen. Ybx1 recognizes the 3 untranslated region (UTR) of sqt RNA and prevents premature translation and Sqt/Nodal signaling. Maternal-effect mutations in zebrafish ybx1 lead to deregulated Nodal signaling, gastrulation failure, and embryonic lethality. Implanted Nodal-coated beads phenocopy ybx1 mutant defects. Thus, Ybx1 prevents ectopic Nodal activity, revealing a new paradigm in the regulation of Nodal signaling, which is likely to be conserved.  Kumari et al."

As the actions of steroids are mediated through the binding of steroid receptors, most studies of EDCs have assumed that they too elicit their effects by binding steroid receptors. We tested an alternative hypothesis, namely that EDCs elicit their effects during embryonic development by disrupting the metabolism of maternally derived steroids, thereby allowing maternally derived steroids to bind steroid receptors and elicit effects. Specifically, we examined the ability of the EDC, bisphenol-A (BPA) to inhibit the normal metabolism of oestradiol during the first nine days of embryonic development in the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta). We found that, when BPA was present, oestrogen metabolism was inhibited when compared to control eggs. In particular, the formation of oestrone sulfate was blocked in BPA-treated eggs. We postulate that the oestrogenic effects of EDCs may be driven, at least in part, by inappropriate oestrogen signalling. The retention of oestrogens at points of development when they would normally be metabolized to inactive forms might also help explain low-dose effects frequently reported for EDCs.  2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

In many avian species, increased competition among breeding females results in increased testosterone concentrations in egg yolks. Generally, elevated yolk testosterone increases nestling growth, competitive behaviors, and bold behavioral traits. However, few studies provide an environmental context with which to examine the potential adaptive benefits of these phenotypic changes. In this study, tree swallow ( Tachycineta bicolor) breeding density was altered to modify levels of social competition and yolk testosterone. We measured nestling growth, competitive ability, and breathing rate in response to a stressor using a partial cross-foster design. Females breeding at high-density experienced more aggressive, competitive interactions and their eggs had higher testosterone concentrations. Nestlings that hatched in high-density environments grew faster and displayed more competitive behaviors and a higher breathing rate response to a stressor regardless of post-hatching density. Our study demonstrates that phenotypic plasticity occurs in response to yolk testosterone variation resulting from different breeding densities. These findings suggest that naturally-induced maternal effects prepare offspring for competitive environments, supporting the idea that maternal effects are adaptive.  2013 Elsevier Inc."

In Blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), we show that age hierarchies are predominantly caused by incubation preclutch completion, such that last laid eggs hatch later than early laid eggs. However, after statistically controlling for incubation behavior late laid eggs are shown to hatch more quickly than early laid eggs reducing the amount of asynchrony. By experimentally switching early and late laid eggs between nests on the day they were laid, we controlled for the effect of differential incubation and found that the faster hatching times of late laid eggs remains. Chicks that hatched earlier were heavier and had higher probability of fledgling, and chicks that hatched from experimental eggs had patterns of growth and survival consistent with this. Egg mass explained a small part of this variation, but the remainder must be due to egg composition. These results are consistent with the idea that intrinsic differences between eggs across the laying sequence serve to mitigate the effects of age-related hierarchies. We also show that between-clutch variation in prenatal developmental rate exists and that it is mainly environmental in origin rather than genetic.  2013 The Society for the Study of Evolution."

Steroid hormones, particularly testosterone (T), play a crucial role in mediating such trade-offs in males, often increasing competitive behaviors while decreasing paternal behavior. Recent research has shown that females also face such trade-offs; however, we know little about the role of T in mediating female phenotypes in general, and the role of T in mediating trade-offs in females in particular. Here we examine the relationship between individual variation in maternal effort and endogenous T in the dark-eyed junco, a common songbird. Specifically, we measure circulating T before and after a physiological challenge (injection of gonadotropin releasing hormone, GnRH), and determine whether either measure is related to provisioning, brooding, or the amount of T sequestered in egg yolk. We found that females producing more T in response to a challenge spent less time brooding nestlings, but provisioned nestlings more frequently, and deposited more T in their eggs. These findings suggest that, while T is likely important in mediating maternal phenotypes and female life history tradeoffs, the direction of the relationships between T and phenotype may differ from what is generally observed in males, and that high levels of endogenous T are not necessarily as costly as previous work might suggest.  2013 Elsevier Inc."

We show that although egg effects are important early in ontogeny they quickly dissipate, suggesting that the genetic interpretation of cross-fostering experiments may be preferable for many types of trait.

Two hormones have been described as important players in the regulation of parental investment in birds: the glucocorticoid hormone corticosterone and prolactin, a pituitary hormone, widely involved in mediating parental behavior. In comparison with corticosterone, the role of prolactin on parental investment remains poorly documented, and most studies so far have been correlative. In this study, the effects of an experimental decrease of prolactin levels on the incubation behavior of a long-lived seabird species were assessed. Male Adlie penguins were treated with self-degradable bromocriptine pellets, inhibiting prolactin secretion. Filming and subsequent video analysis allowed the determination of a behavioral time budget for birds and their position on the nest, while dummy eggs recorded incubation parameters. Incubation duration and breeding success at hatching were also monitored. As expected, bromocriptine-treatment significantly decreased plasma prolactin levels, but did not affect corticosterone levels. The behavioral time budget of penguins was not affected by the treatment. However, treated birds spent significantly more time in an upright position on the nest. These birds also incubated their eggs at lower temperatures and turned their eggs more frequently than controls, resulting in a lengthened incubation period. Despite this, the treatment was insufficient to trigger nest desertion and eggs of treated birds still hatched, indicating that several endocrine signals are required for the induction of nest abandonment. We suggest that the decreased prolactin levels in treated birds offset their timeline of breeding, so that birds displayed behavior typical of early incubation.  2013 Elsevier Inc."

The function of hatching asynchrony is much debated, and it has been suggested that the induced size hierarchy among offspring may be an adaptive maternal mechanism for maximizing reproductive output under variable environmental conditions. The best known hypothesis to explain the adaptive value of hatching asynchrony, the 'brood reduction' hypothesis, holds that a size hierarchy among offspring allows for a quick adaptive adjustment of brood size to unpredictable feeding conditions and thus benefits parents. To test the consequences of hatching asynchrony on offspring growth and food provisioning we experimentally manipulated the onset of incubation of eggs within broods of great tits, Parus major, to induce either synchronous or asynchronous hatching, and then manipulated brood size after hatching to simulate favourable, control or harsh conditions. We did not find a difference in offspring mortality between asynchronous and synchronous broods under any of these conditions. In harsh conditions, nestling mass and size were reduced in asynchronous broods compared to synchronous ones. The opposite pattern occurred under control conditions. Although our results showed that induced hatching asynchrony alters offspring phenotype, they do not provide strong support for the brood reduction hypothesis as a mechanism to explain hatching asynchrony.  2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

We analysed primary sex ratio of common terns Sterna hirundo from 2006 to 2008 and related it to maternal baseline corticosterone level, laying date and year. Therefore, we took 101 blood samples of 71 breeding females via blood sucking bugs, a method with negligible stress for the birds. Sex ratio did not differ from parity in any of the analysed years, which were characterized by poor food availability and breeding success. Only within 1 year there was a tendency for more females in the last hatched chick. Neither corticosterone level nor laying date or year showed an influence on hatching sex ratio. The negative result concerning primary sex ratio and maternal baseline corticosterone level might suggest conditions to be good enough for mothers to prevent them from depositing high levels of corticosterone into eggs.  2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

In birds with biparental care, males may contribute to improve the condition and health of their pair-mates through help in constructing nests, incubation or incubation feeding and nestling provisioning. They may also reduce harassment of females by non-pair males. A consequence of these male activities could be expressed in terms of oxidative damage, which may depend on metabolic effort and social stress. Here, we have related male contribution to parental and territorial duties to female oxidative status in the pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca, a species where preferred males present darker dorsal plumage and, in Iberian populations, a large white forehead patch. Darker males were paired with females with high incubation attendance and reduced nestling provisioning rates, which may lead to reduced female exertion. These males owned nest boxes at which there were fewer visits by non-pair males. Although females paired with dark mates worked less hard, they were able to raise more fledglings. Female oxidative damage measured as malondialdehyde (MDA) level in plasma declined with increasing incubation attendance and male incubation feeding. Moreover, levels of MDA in females declined with both darkness of male dorsal plumage and male forehead patch size when controlling for female forehead patch size and male age. The effect of male plumage darkness was especially strong. Females paired with middle-aged males (2-3yr) showed reduced levels of MDA compared with those paired with 1-yr-old and more than 3-yr-old males. Male age could not explain the effects of male attractiveness. Females paired with attractive males were more successful in reproduction while suffering reduced oxidative damage, possibly mediated by help during incubation and nestling rearing from their pair-mates. Although correlative, the evidence suggests direct benefits of females paired with more attractive males.  2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH."

Female southern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes chrysocome paired with heavy mates reduced intra-clutch variation in egg and albumen masses. Females paired with new mates also reduced intra-clutch variation in yolk androgen levels. Since both an increased mass and increased androgen concentrations positively influence chick survival under sibling competition, the chances of fledging the whole clutch are likely to be higher for newly formed pairs with heavy males than for previously formed pairs with light males. Interestingly, total clutch provisioning did not vary with male quality. We show for the first time that females vary intra-clutch variation in resource allocation according to male quality.

In species exhibiting male or mutual mate choice, females may benefit from being attractive. While male attractiveness is often positively influenced by higher plasma levels of the androgenic hormone testosterone, it has been shown that testosterone can masculinise female behavior and morphology in several bird species, potentially rendering them less attractive. In this study, we investigated whether female budgerigars, Melopsittacus undulatus, suffer from increased plasma testosterone levels through a negative effect on their attractiveness to males. We experimentally increased plasma testosterone levels in testosterone-treated females (T-females) compared to controls (C-females) and allowed males to choose between a T- and a C-female in a two-way choice situation. Although testosterone treatment significantly affected female behavioral and morphological characteristics, males did not show a significant difference in preference between T- and C-females. These results suggest that experimentally increasing testosterone levels in females does not appear to influence male preference during initial mate choice. Our findings indicate that selection for higher levels of testosterone in male budgerigars is probably not constrained by a correlated response to selection causing negative effects on female attractiveness during initial mate choice. Evaluating whether or not a potential constraint may arise from negative testosterone-induced effects on other fitness related traits in females requires further work.  2013 Lahaye et al."

However, current literature depicts an inconsistent pattern in altricial vs. semi-precocial species, with stimulating versus inhibitory effects of the hormone respectively. This is possibly due to a difference in the methodology of hormone treatment (short-term moderate dose versus a long-term stronger elevation, respectively) between the studies performed so far. In this study, we induced short-term moderate peaks in plasma testosterone levels, as applied in altricial bird species, and assessed the effects of our manipulation on begging, competitive and aggressive behavior in black-headed gull (Larus ridibundus) chicks, a semi-precocial species. Our results suggest that, unlike in altricial songbirds, temporary increase of plasma testosterone concentration suppresses begging and enhances aggressiveness towards intruders. However, it also increases aggression and the chances of getting priority while scrambling with nest mates to gain access to food. Thus, the inconsistencies in the hormonal control of begging behavior observed between altricial vs. semi-precocial birds seem real and perhaps related to species differences in complexity of the display and the nature of competition.

Certain combinations of genotypes and pre- and post-natal conditions may provide higher fitness in a specific environmental context. Here, we investigated how grey partridges Perdix perdix of two strains (wild and domesticated) cope physiologically with pre- and post-natal predictable vs. unpredictable food supply. Food unpredictability occurs frequently in wild environments and requires physiological and behavioural adjustments. Well-orchestrated and efficient physiological systems are presumably more vital in a wild environment as compared to captivity. We thus predicted that wild-strain grey partridges have a stronger immunity, glucocorticoid (GC) stress response and oxidative stress resistance (OSR) than domesticated birds, which have undergone adaptations to captivity. We also predicted that wild-strain birds react more strongly to environmental stimuli and, when faced with harsh prenatal conditions, are better able to prepare their offspring for similarly poor post-natal conditions than birds of domesticated origin. We found that wild-strain offspring were physiologically better prepared for stressful situations as compared to the domesticated strain. They had a high GC stress response and a high OSR when kept under predictable food supply. Wild-strain parents reacted to prenatal unpredictable food supply by lowering their offspring's GC stress response, which potentially lowered GC-induced oxidative pressure. No such pattern was evident in the domesticated birds. Irrespective of strain and prenatal feeding scheme, post-natal unpredictable food supply boosted immune indices, and GC stress response was negatively related to antibody response in females and to mitochondrial superoxide production. Wild-strain grey partridge showed fitness-relevant physiological advantages and appeared to prepare their offspring for the prospective environment. Negative relationships between GC stress response, immunity and oxidative indices imply a pivotal role of an organism's oxidative balance and support the importance of considering multiple physiological systems simultaneously.  2013 British Ecological Society."

For instance, many researchers study individual species to understand evolution of ornamental traits which appear to be products of sexual selection. I explored our understanding of sexual ornaments in a well-studied vertebrate species that may serve as a case study for research programs in evolutionary biology. I attempted to located all published papers examining plumage colour and variables related to sexual selection hypotheses in a common European songbird, the blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus). Researchers have estimated over 1200 statistical relationships with plumage colour of blue tits in 52 studies. However, of the approximately 1000 main-effect relationships from the 48 studies that are candidates for inclusion in this meta-analysis, more than 400 were reported without details of strength and direction. Circumstantial evidence suggests that an unknown number of other estimated effects remain unpublished. Missing information is a substantial barrier to interpretation of these papers and to meta-analytic synthesis. Examination and analysis of funnel plots indicated that unpublished effects may be a biased sample of all effects, especially for comparisons of plumage colour to age and individual quality, and possibly also to measures of mate choice. Further, type I error was likely elevated by the large number of statistical comparisons evaluated, the frequent use of iterative model-building procedures, and a willingness to interpret a wide variety of results as support for a hypothesis. Type I errors were made more problematic because blue tit plumage researchers only rarely have attempted to replicate important findings in their own work or that of others. Replication is essential to drawing robust scientific conclusions, especially in probabilistic systems with moderate to weak effects or a likelihood of bias. Last, researchers studying blue tit plumage have often developed ad hoc explanations for deviations of results from their predictions. Revising hypotheses in light of data is appropriate, but these revised hypotheses were rarely tested with new data. The only highly robust conclusion supported by meta-analysis is that male blue tits have plumage that reflects more light in the ultraviolet and yellow wavelengths than the plumage of females. Various other effects, including condition-dependence of plumage colour expression and a tendency for females to adjust the sex ratio of their offspring in response to male colour, remain uncertain. These obstacles to progress in the blue tit plumage literature are likely common in evolutionary biology, and so I recommend changes to incentive structures which may improve progress towards scientific understanding in this discipline.  2012 Cambridge Philosophical Society."

Both behaviours influence each other and it is, therefore, hypothesized that they should ultimately become (genetically) correlated, stabilized by fitness costs to parents and/or offspring. By reciprocally exchanging entire clutches in canaries (Serinus canaria), we tested (1) whether there is covariation between these behaviours and (2) whether a mismatch - as introduced by cross-fostering - entails costs. Begging was scored in a standardized begging test and parental provisioning was measured via (a) the actual feeding rate and (b) using the growth rate of the foster nestlings as a proxy. Costs were established in terms of future reproductive investment in subsequent clutches and offspring growth. We found a positive and significant phenotypic covariation between offspring begging and parental feeding when using the growth rate as a proxy and, to a lesser extent, in case of the parental feeding rate. Female parents suffered no future reproductive costs when feeding foster nestlings that were more demanding than their own nestlings. Neither growth measured amongst all offspring nor the reproductive investment measured amongst the female offspring as adults was influenced by their begging behaviour. However, the reproductive investment of female offspring tended to depend on the parental qualities of their foster parents. Thus, offspring may only be able to extract resources within the limit of generosity of their foster parents. This suggests parental control of feeding, which is also supported by the positive covariation between offspring begging and parental feeding.  2013 Estramil et al."

However, studies on the effects of androgens on begging behavior and growth in birds have provided variable results and sex-specific effects are not well understood. We experimentally elevated yolk androgen levels in whole clutches in a passerine bird, the pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca and studied effects on male and female begging behavior, ingestion and digestion. Yolk androgen elevation led to shorter latencies to beg in both male and female nestlings but to greater begging rates only in males. Both responses could be used as cues to solicit more food from parents. Yolk androgens had no effect on food intake, fecal wet mass or fecal water content. However, the proportion of organic matter in feces was lower in androgen-treated than control males, potentially suggesting that the androgen-treated individuals had more efficient digestion. We discuss the alternative pathways of effects of yolk androgens on begging, growth and digestion. If the effects of yolk androgens on phenotype and behavior are causally linked, there is less scope for the mother to adjust specific offspring traits independently from other traits. The sex-specific effects of yolk androgens should be studied more, also in within-clutch context, as the costs and benefits for each sex may further differ in relation to hatching order.  2013 The Author.

Work on psychological differences on children within human families has focused primarily on differences in the nonshared environment of contemporary siblings, though the precise location of this nonshared environment is still the subject of much debate. Here I explore the range of explanations for within-brood diversity from the perspective of nonhuman families, particularly birds that share certain key features with human families. I examine the role of social rank in creating a nonshared environment within the family, and present data from a model system (an altricial bird) to illustrate how different the effective environments experienced by offspring sitting side-by-side in the same confined physical space, tended by the same parents, and experiencing similar ecological variability, can be. These broodmates can effectively live in different worlds. I then briefly explore other sources of diversity among offspring in nonhuman families, including within brood genetic differences and non-genetic maternal (parental) effects that often covary with birth/hatching rank. Given the ubiquity and far-reaching consequences of maternal effects in nonhuman families, and some human data suggestive of similar patterns, it would seem worthwhile to explore the potential role of maternal effects in creating phenotypic diversity in psychological traits among children in human families."

Although the occurrence of failure of polar body extrusion is obvious from the observations of chimeric birds, the idea that it could be the first step of offspring sex ratio bias has been entirely overlooked.

New work suggests that elevated glucocorticoid levels during physiological stress may play a role in maintaining signal honesty. Here, we experimentally examine the effect of both chronic and acute stress on the expression of the condition-dependent ornamentation of female striped plateau lizards, Sceloporus virgatus. Females were stressed either chronically via corticosterone implants or relatively acutely via autotomy, were sham manipulated or were left unmanipulated. Both stressors resulted in elevations in corticosterone within physiologically relevant levels, though the implants resulted in significantly higher levels than did autotomy. Corticosterone-implanted females were less likely to produce a clutch of eggs, but those individuals that did reproduce had reproductive output similar to that of females from other treatment groups. Compared with females in other groups, the corticosterone-implanted females tended to develop smaller ornaments that had less UV and orange-to-red wavelength reflectance relative to medium wavelength reflectance. The sex steroid hormones testosterone and estradiol were correlated to corticosterone levels, but did not appear to underlie the effect on ornament expression; of the steroids measured, only corticosterone levels were negatively related to ornament size and coloration. Thus, the condition-dependent ornamentation of female lizards is sensitive to chronic elevations in stress hormones, supporting their importance in the maintenance of signal honesty.  2013.

In particular, we evaluated the relationship between plasma Ca levels (mg/dL) in incubating females (as an indicator of the physiological response of females to increased Ca demand associated with clutch production) and several fitness-related egg traits such as egg size (i.e., egg volume), egg shape, and eggshell thickness from three-egg clutches. Egg size was positively related with incubating female plasma Ca levels, with the slope of this relationship being significantly higher for later-laid eggs. The observational nature of this study and reversed timing precludes causal inferences, but observed relationships supported the constraining role of Ca in egg synthesis and suggested that Ca may also have a role in modulating the intraclutch pattern of egg-size variation typical of this gull species."

This study is the first to determine a wide array of egg components and hen body weight in relation to the sex of the egg in unincubated eggs.

There were no significant overall differences between male and female chicken eggs in any of the measured egg parameters.

We investigated the relationship between nestlings' morphology, timing of reproduction, and sex ratios in broods of the Saltmarsh Sparrow (Ammodramus caudacutus), a species with extreme levels of multiple paternity: males provide no parental care and sex ratios of adults may be highly skewed. By molecular methods, we sexed 157 nestlings from 52 Saltmarsh Sparrow nests in Connecticut over 2 years. Their sex ratio was significantly skewed toward males (59%) and did not vary with brood size, but this imbalance is insufficient to fully explain the reported skew in adults' sex ratio. Just prior to fledging, male nestlings were larger than female nestlings, which may suggest that they are more costly to produce. Survivorship is greater in nests initiated immediately after high spring tides, but we found no relationship between sex-ratio bias and the risk of tidal flooding. Female Saltmarsh Sparrows consistently produce male-skewed broods, regardless of their nests' risk of flooding, suggesting that male nestlings are a consistently better investment. The Saltmarsh Sparrow appears to be an exception to the pattern typical of birds, in which the population of adults is skewed toward males but the sex ratio of offspring is balanced.

The Investment Hypothesis addresses variable female allocation of maternal resources into egg yolk and predicts that high quality females and females paired to high-quality males will invest more in their eggs. We test predictions of the Investment Hypothesis in the Diamond Firetail Stagonopleura guttata. In captive females and their pair males, we compare yolk carotenoid (lutein and zeaxanthin) allocation and egg size in relation to traits indicative of individual quality (body condition, flank spot number, bill and rump colour).

It has recently been hypothesised that females may try to manipulate their mates by modifying offspring begging behaviour through yolk hormone deposition, shifting the division of labour in their own favour. To test this hypothesis we first investigated how yellow-legged gull (Larus michaellis) parents feed offspring in relation to each component of complex begging behaviour and if feeding behaviour varies between sexes. Then we investigated the effect of yolk testosterone on chicks' begging by experimentally increasing yolk testosterone levels. Our results revealed that yolk testosterone has a component-specific effect on chicks' begging, specifically increasing the number of chatter calls. Parental feeding effort was influenced by the number of chatter calls emitted by chicks, but most importantly, the influence was stronger in male than in female parents. Moreover, chick body mass increased with the number of paternal feeds.

Theory predicts that males should adjust their ejaculate size or quality in response to variation in female experience or phenotypic quality. In addition, sperm investment by males may also be influenced by their own status and experience. Although such adjustments of male ejaculate size can impact reproductive success (via fertilization success), fitness returns from male sperm investment may be influenced (either limited or facilitated) by the level of maternal investment. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment that simultaneously evaluated the effect of paternal and maternal experience (which incorporates mating status, age, body size, and other related variables) on paternal sperm investment and maternal reproductive allocation in the lizard Anolis sagrei. During staged mating trials, experienced males were more likely to copulate with females, but these individuals were less likely to transfer sperm during mating than were nave individuals. Maternal experience had no impact on these mating behaviors. In contrast to expectations, experience and phenotypic quality (of both sexes) had no impact on male ejaculate size or quality (proportion of live sperm) or on maternal reproductive investment (in terms of egg size and yolk steroids). These findings were intriguing given the mating system and past evidence for differential maternal investment in relation to sire quality in A. sagrei.

The red spot on the lower mandible in adult gulls is one of the best-known examples of a signal triggering chick begging. We examined whether the begging response of chicks (pecking for food and the chatter call for drawing parental attention) was affected by the spot size within the natural range of variation on a dummy head. Using a cross-fostering experiment, we examined whether these responses covary with the size of the genetic or social parent's spot. We found that the natural variation in size of this parental signal strongly influenced intensity of chick begging. Pecking increased when chicks were stimulated by a larger red spot. Additionally, pecking intensity increased in chicks reared by mothers with a large red spot, suggesting that this begging component is influenced by previous experience. In contrast, chick hatching order affected the number of chatter calls produced in relation to the size of the red spot on the dummy, suggesting the presence of different begging strategies according to brood hierarchy. The differential call response to a small/large red spot on the dummy was positively correlated with the original mothers' red spot size and negatively with that of the original fathers.

We examined the causes of variation in hatching asynchrony between broods of zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, in three environments: domesticated, captive wild and wild free-living. We found that broods of both domesticated and wild birds taken into captivity hatched more asynchronously than wild free-living broods. This was directly attributable to both male and female parents of domesticated and captive wild broods initiating incubation as soon as the first egg was laid as opposed to when the clutch was virtually complete in wild free-living broods. Wild free-living birds that were transferred to captive environments immediately switched to the incubation onset behaviour seen in domesticated birds, thereby demonstrating a previously unsuspected level of intraspecific plasticity in incubation behaviour. This finding suggests that something about the captive environment is driving the early onset of incubation and contributing to an elevated level of hatching asynchrony in captive birds. Across all populations and environments males contributed almost equally to incubation, and the onset of incubation by males was highly coordinated with that of their partner.  2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

Our previous work has suggested that such changes in behavior may be due in part to hormone-dependent sensory processing. In the auditory forebrain of female white-throated sparrows, expression of the immediate early gene ZENK (egr-1) is higher in response to conspecific song than to a control sound only when plasma estradiol reaches breeding-typical levels. Estradiol also increases the number of detectable noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus and the density of noradrenergic and serotonergic fibers innervating auditory areas. We hypothesize, therefore, that reproductive hormones alter auditory responses by acting on monoaminergic systems. This possibility has not been examined in males. Here, we treated non-breeding male white-throated sparrows with testosterone to mimic breeding-typical levels and then exposed them to conspecific male song or frequency-matched tones. We observed selective ZENK responses in the caudomedial nidopallium only in the testosterone-treated males. Responses in another auditory area, the caudomedial mesopallium, were selective regardless of hormone treatment. Testosterone treatment reduced serotonergic fiber density in the auditory forebrain, thalamus, and midbrain, and although it increased the number of noradrenergic neurons detected in the locus coeruleus, it reduced noradrenergic fiber density in the auditory midbrain. Thus, whereas we previously reported that estradiol enhances monoaminergic innervation of the auditory pathway in females, we show here that testosterone decreases it in males. Mechanisms underlying testosterone-dependent selectivity of the ZENK response may differ from estradiol-dependent ones.  2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Here, we study whether experimentally manipulated availability of dietary antioxidants, vitamins C and E, influences the expression of genetic variance for antioxidant defence, endocrine signal and body mass in yellow-legged gull chicks using quantitative genetic models based on full siblings. Our experimental study in a natural population reveals that the expression of genetic variance in total antioxidant capacity in plasma increased in chicks supplemented with vitamins C and E despite the negligible effects on the average phenotype. This suggests that individuals differ in their ability to capture and transport dietary antioxidants or to respond to these extra resources, and importantly, this ability has a genetic basis. Corticosterone level in plasma and body mass were negatively correlated at the phenotypic level. Significant genetic variance of corticosterone level appeared only in control chicks nonsupplemented with vitamins, suggesting that the genetic variation of endocrine system, which transmits environmental cues to adaptively control chick development, appeared in stressful conditions (i.e. poor antioxidant availability). Therefore, environmental inputs may shape evolutionary trajectories of antioxidant capacity and endocrine system by affecting the expression of cryptic genetic variation.  2013 European Society For Evolutionary Biology."

In black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) where parents and chicks are provided with unlimited access to supplemental food during the breeding season, brood reduction still occurs and varies interannually. Survival of the junior chick is therefore affected by factors in addition to the amount of food directly available to them. Maternally deposited yolk androgens affect competitive dynamics within a brood, and may be one of the mechanisms by which mothers mediate brood reduction in response to a suite of environmental and physiological cues. The goal of this study was to determine whether food supplementation during the pre-lay period affected patterns of yolk androgen deposition in free-living kittiwakes in two years (2003 and 2004) that varied in natural food availability. Chick survival was measured concurrently in other nests where eggs were not collected. In both years, supplemental feeding increased female investment in eggs by increasing egg mass. First-laid (""A"") eggs were heavier but contained less testosterone and androstenedione than second-laid (""B"") eggs across years and treatments. Yolk testosterone was higher in 2003 (the year with higher B chick survival) across treatments. The difference in yolk testosterone levels between eggs within a clutch varied among years and treatments such that it was relatively small when B chick experienced the lowest and the highest survival probabilities, and increased with intermediate B chick survival probabilities. The magnitude of testosterone asymmetry in a clutch may allow females to optimize fitness by either predisposing a brood for reduction or facilitating survival of younger chicks."

While it is evident that yolk hormones can affect antioxidant status of nestlings, it is not known whether their effect extends beyond the nestling stage. In this study, we use the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) to test experimentally whether exposure to elevated yolk testosterone (T) levels can result in long-term effects on antioxidant status and traits likely to be associated with this measure. Our data show a significant but sex-specific effect with respect to a period from fledging to the age of 7 mo; T males had higher antioxidant status than control males, whereas antioxidant levels did not differ among females and were intermediate compared with the two male groups. Bill color, a trait associated with carotenoids (a specific group of antioxidants) and known to be under the control of circulating levels of T, was not affected by our yolk T manipulation. Bill color (alone or in covariation with egg treatment or sex) did not predict immune responsiveness or antioxidant status. Moreover, there was only weak evidence that antioxidant status predicted the strength of different immune responses. Antioxidant status (in covariation with egg treatment and sex) predicted levels of circulating total antibody levels but did not predict the strength of cell-mediated and humoral immune responses.

When resources are abundant, parents can successfully raise all hatched offspring, but when resources are scarce, brood reduction, i.e., the sacrifice of some siblings to secure the quality of a subset of offspring, may maximize fitness. Differential transfer of maternal androgens is one potential proximate mechanism through which female birds may facilitate brood reduction because it may alter the relative competitive ability of sibling nestlings. We tested the hypothesis that female collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) manipulate sibling competition by transferring less androgens to eggs late in the laying sequence. We experimentally elevated androgen levels in i) whole clutches and ii) only the two last laid eggs, and compared growth and begging behavior of offspring from these treatments with a control treatment. By using three treatments and video assessment of begging, we examined the effects of within-clutch patterns of yolk androgen transfer on levels of sibling competition in situ. When androgens were elevated in only the two last laid eggs, begging was more even among siblings compared to control nests. We also found that female nestlings receiving additional yolk androgens showed higher mass gain later in the breeding season, while their male counterparts did not. Our results suggest that females may improve reproductive success in unpredictable environments by altering within-clutch patterns of yolk androgen transfer. We discuss the possibility that life-history divergence between the co-occurring collared and pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) is amplified by patterns of yolk androgen transfer.  2013 Elsevier Inc."

Among birds, such transitions can be mediated by the steroid hormone testosterone (T), resulting in a T-mediated behavioural trade-off. This theory is supported by many implantation studies with birds demonstrating that the administration of exogenous T during parental phases can negatively affect offspring care. However, little is known about relationships between naturally circulating levels of T and parental behaviour in wild bird populations. We examined covariation in circulating levels of T (before and after injection of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)) and nestling provisioning rates in male and female northern cardinals, Cardinalis cardinalis, a highly aggressive, biparental resident songbird. Results indicate that both sexes had detectable levels of initial T when providing parental care, but only males produced significantly higher elevations of T following GnRH injections. Furthermore, T levels (both initial and following GnRH injections) and nestling provisioning rates did not covary for either sex, and these measures were not correlated between members of breeding pairs. When results of this study are considered with prior work indicating that elevations in T might not be necessary to support male or female aggression in this species, it appears that relationships between circulating T and reproductive behaviour could be more complex for the cardinal than for many others birds similarly examined. Such findings warrant additional examination of interrelationships between T, aggression and other forms of parental care to assess whether this species engages in T-mediated behavioural trade-offs. Possible alternative mechanisms influencing behaviour in the cardinal and future directions for research are discussed.  2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

By experimentally relating hormone-induced changes in phenotype to fitness, it is possible to ask whether existing phenotypes perform better or worse than alternative phenotypes, and hence to predict how selection might act on a novel or rare phenotype. In a songbird, the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis), we have examined the effects of experimentally elevated T in females on fitness-related behaviors such as parental care. In this study, we implanted female juncos with exogenous T and examined its effect on fitness (survival, reproduction, and extra-pair mating) to assess whether T-altered phenotypes would prove to be adaptive or deleterious for females. Experimental elevation of T decreased the likelihood that a female would breed successfully, and T-implanted females had lower total reproductive success at every stage of the reproductive cycle. They did not, however, differ from control females in fledgling quality, extra-pair offspring production, survival, or reproduction in the following year. Previous work in this system has shown that experimental elevation of T in males alters behavior and physiology and decreases survival but increases the production of extra-pair offspring, leading to higher net fitness relative to control animals. Our results suggest that increased T has divergent effects on male and female fitness in this species, and that prevailing levels in females may be adaptive for them. These findings are consistent with sexual conflict. We gave testosterone (T) implants to female juncos to examine effects on fitness. T decreases female net reproductive success due to its effects on egg production. Maternal T had no effect on nestling quality, but may increase juvenile survival. T had no effect on female overwinter return or extra-pair offspring production. Selection against high T in females may be constraining evolution of T in males.  2013 Elsevier Inc."

Males and females vary in basic life-history characteristics (e.g., stage-specific mortality, maturation) in ways that are unrelated to parental investment. Surprisingly, few studies have examined the effect of this variation in male and female life history on the evolution of care. Here, we use a theoretical approach to determine the sex-specific life-history characteristics that give rise to the origin of paternal, maternal, or bi-parental care from an ancestral state of no care. Females initially invest more into each egg than males. Despite this inherent difference between the sexes, paternal, maternal, and bi-parental care are equally likely when males and females are otherwise similar. Thus, sex differences in initial zygotic investment do not explain the origin of one pattern of care over another. However, sex differences in adult mortality, egg maturation rate, and juvenile survival affect the pattern of care that will be most likely to evolve. Maternal care is more likely if female adult mortality is high, whereas paternal care is more likely if male adult mortality is high. These findings suggest that basic life-history differences between the sexes can alone explain the origin of maternal, paternal, and bi-parental care. As a result, the influence of life-history characteristics should be considered as a baseline scenario in studies examining the origin of care.  2013 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution."

We use a mathematical model to examine the effect of male and female life-history characteristics (stage-specific maturation and mortality) on evolutionary transitions among maternal, paternal, and bi-parental care. When males and females are relatively similar - that is, when females initially invest relatively little into eggs and both sexes have similar mortality and maturation - transitions among different patterns of care are unlikely to be strongly favored. As males and females become more different, transitions are more likely. If females initially invest heavily into eggs and this reduces their expected future reproductive success, transitions to increased maternal care (paternal  maternal, paternal  bi-parental, bi-parental  maternal) are favored. This effect of anisogamy (i.e., the fact that females initially invest more into each individual zygote than males) might help explain the predominance of maternal care in nature and differs from previous work that found no effect of anisogamy on the origin of different sex-specific patterns of care from an ancestral state of no care. When male mortality is high or male egg maturation rate is low, males have reduced future reproductive potential and transitions to increased paternal care (maternal  paternal, bi-parental  paternal, maternal  bi-parental) are favored. Offspring need (i.e., low offspring survival in the absence of care) also plays a role in transitions to paternal care. In general, basic life-history differences between the sexes can drive evolutionary transitions among different sex-specific patterns of care. The finding that simple life-history differences can alone lead to transitions among maternal and paternal care suggests that the effect of inter-sexual life-history differences should be considered as a baseline scenario when attempting to understand how other factors (mate availability, sex differences in the costs of competing for mates) influence the evolution of parental care.

Whether a similar effect is present in precocial species that do not beg is less well known. We therefore increased yolk testosterone levels within the physiological range at the onset of incubation to study its effects on food competition behaviour in the domestic chicken, Gallus gallus domesticus. We found an increase in competitiveness in testosterone-treated male domestic chicks, raising their level to that of the females. This is in line with the decrease in circulating plasma levels of males in the direction of the levels in females, and the overall decrease in androgen receptor densities after prenatal treatment as found previously. Hormones are known to have long-lasting organizing effects on behaviour and to affect sexual differentiation in vertebrates. Although research into hormone-mediated maternal effects has been productive, only a few studies describe (the ambiguous) effects into adulthood. Therefore we followed our animals into adulthood and recorded androgen-dependent social behaviour and secondary sexual characteristics, body mass and circulating plasma testosterone levels and checked whether these variables were treatment dependent. Treatment had a near significant effect on comb colour (both brightness and chroma). Again treatment caused a shift towards a more female-like phenotype. This suggests that, in contrast to earlier suggestions, maternal androgens may interact with (but not disrupt) sexual differentiation of brain and behaviour and the development of secondary sexual characteristics.  2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

Recent studies focus on the role of eggshell colour as a postmating sexually selected trait of females which manipulates male parental investment. A basic prediction of this hypothesis is that egg pigmentation reflects female quality. In this study we examine whether there is a relationship between eggshell colouration and either female quality or egg quality in reed warblers. This open cup nesting species has eggs that are heavily spotted with brownish marks on a bluish-green background. We used several parameters describing female and egg quality, and measured eggshell colouration at the blunt pole and the egg centre, deriving four colour variables from colour spectrometry. To determine egg quality parameters, the third egg of each clutch was sampled and analysed. To determine female quality, females were trapped shortly after egg laying, and several morphological and a single conditional variable were determined. Additionally, a blood sample was taken to determine blood parasites (avian malaria and Trypanosoma spp.) and a faecal sample to determine intestinal parasites (Isospora spp). Our results revealed that eggshell pigmentation appears to be independent of female condition and parasites, but reflects concentrations of egg compounds such as testosterone and lysozyme. Egg colouration is also related to yolk weight and egg size. Our results further suggested that the information about colour varies depending on the position on the egg (blunt pole or egg centre). The only relationship with females was between female size (tarsus length) and egg colouration, which suggests a genetic component. We discuss reasons for the absence of a relationship between egg colouration and female quality.  2013 Dipartimento di Biologia, Universit degli Studi di Firenze, Italia."

In chickens, elevated plasma corticosterone down-regulates testosterone and progesterone concentrations in plasma, but also in egg yolk. This suppression could be mediated via the hypothalamic-pituitary system but also via local inhibition of gonadal activity by glucocorticoids. As the latter has not been tested in birds yet, we tested if corticosterone directly inhibits ovarian steroid synthesis under in vitro conditions. We hypothesized that degradation of corticosterone by follicular cells impairs their ability to synthesize reproductive hormones due to either inhibition of enzymes or competition for common co-factors. Therefore, we first established whether follicles degrade corticosterone. Follicular tissue was harvested from freshly euthanized laying hens and incubated with radiolabelled corticosterone. Radioactive metabolites were visualized and quantified by autoradiography. Follicles converted corticosterone in a time-dependent manner into metabolites with a higher polarity than corticosterone. The predominant metabolite co-eluted with 20-dihydrocorticosterone. Other chicken tissues mostly formed the same metabolite when incubated with corticosterone. In a second experiment, follicles were incubated with either progesterone or dehydroepiandrosterone. Corticosterone was added in increasing dosages up to 1000. ng per ml medium. Corticosterone did not inhibit the conversion of progesterone and dehydroepiandrosterone into a number of different metabolites, including 17-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione and testosterone.

We examined, under common conditions in the laboratory, the anti-predator responses and life histories of tadpoles raised with predatory Aeshna dragonfly larvae in two consecutive years with a difference of 20 days in breeding time in the north, but no difference in breeding time in the nouth. In a year with late breeding, northern tadpoles did not modify their behaviour and morphology in the presence of predators, and metamorphosed faster and smaller than tadpoles born in a year with early breeding. In the year with early breeding, northern tadpoles showed a completely different anti-predator strategy by reducing activity and developing morphological defences in the presence of predators. We discuss the possible mechanisms that could activate these responses (likely a form of environmentally-mediated parental effect).

In birds, most of the currently available evidence on sex-biased environmental sensitivity in nestlings is derived from species that display sexual size dimorphism, while studies on monomorphic or slightly dimorphic species are less abundant and have produced inconsistent results. We have evaluated sex-specific vulnerability to breeding conditions in chicks of the Gull-billed Tern (Gelochelidon nilotica), a semiprecocial species with only low sexual size dimorphism. We compared male and female mass growth and fledgling physiological condition (measured through plasma metabolite levels) in several colonies that differed in reproductive parameters. Chicks of both sexes grew more slowly and fledged with lower mass and poorer nutritional state in the colony with the worst breeding conditions, i. e., with later phenology and lower clutch size and reproductive success. Contrary to our expectations, chick vulnerability to rearing conditions was more pronounced for female than male fledglings. While males grew faster than females during the middle phase of growth regardless of colony, this difference disappeared later in the fledging period in all but the worst colony, where females maintained a lower mass and worse nutritional condition than males. These results add to the evidence that, even in monomorphic species, the environmental sensitivity of nestlings during development may vary in a sex-specific way that may select for sex-biased allocation of parental resources and sex ratio adjustments under specific breeding conditions.  2012 Dt.

Cooperatively breeding species offer a particularly interesting context in which to study maternal allocation because helpers create predictably improved conditions during offspring development. Some recent studies on cooperative species showed that females assisted by helpers produced smaller eggs, as the additional food brought by the helpers appeared to compensate for this reduction in egg size. However, it remains unclear how common this effect might be. Also currently unknown is whether females change egg composition when assisted by helpers. This effect is predicted by current maternal allocation theory, but has not been previously investigated. We studied egg mass and contents in sociable weavers (Philetairus socius). We found that egg mass decreased with group size, while fledgling mass did not vary, suggesting that helpers may compensate for the reduced investment in eggs. We found no differences in eggs' carotenoid contents, but females assisted by helpers produced eggs with lower hormonal content, specifically testosterone, androstenedione (A4) and corticosterone levels. Taken together, these results suggest that the environment created by helpers can influence maternal allocation and potentially offspring phenotypes.  2013 Paquet et al."

Although sexual selection explains vivid coloration in males, functional significance of vivid coloration in females of socially monogamous species remains unclear. The hypothesis of mutual mate choice predicts that more ornamented females produce offspring of higher quality. We tested this prediction in the great tit (Parus major), a small, insectivorous, socially monogamous passerine. Results: In both females and males we quantified three ornaments that have been hypothesized to have signaling role in this species (size of black breast stripe, carotenoid chroma of yellow breast feathers, immaculateness of the white cheek). We swapped broods between nests soon after hatching, thus separating genetic plus pre-hatching vs. post-hatching effects on offspring performance. Body mass of offspring at 14 days of age was positively related to the area of black breast stripe of genetic mothers. Immune response to a novel antigen (phytohaemagglutinin) at 14 days of age was positively related to the immaculateness of the white cheek patch of both genetic and foster mothers. Conclusions: We showed that females with more elaborate ornaments produced higher-quality offspring and we discuss potential proximate mechanisms of these relationships. We conclude that as more elaborate ornaments were reliable signals of offspring quality, direct selection by male mate choice might have been responsible for the evolution and/or maintenance of these signaling traits in females.  2013 Reme and Matysiokov; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

We studied the long-term effects of yolk androgens on several phenotypic and physiological traits in male and female pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) by experimentally elevating yolk androgen levels and rearing birds in common-garden environment in captivity. We found that high yolk androgen levels increased the basal metabolic rates in both females and males in adulthood. High yolk androgen levels did not affect male melanin coloration or plumage ornaments, or timing or speed of moult in either sex. No effect of androgen treatment on cell-mediated or humoral immune response was found in either sex. Covariation among the measured phenotypic traits was further not altered by androgen treatment. Our results suggest that exposure to high androgen levels can have long-lasting effects on some offspring traits, but do not seem to lead to different phenotypes. Furthermore, the role of yolk androgens affecting sexually selected male traits in our study species seems to be minor.

Between-female variation in the amounts of these yolk androgens has been associated with a number of social and environmental factors, suggesting that the variation is adaptive, but the mechanisms behind it are unknown. Using two different approaches, we tested the hypothesis that variation in yolk androgen levels across individuals is associated with variation in their capacity to synthesize androgens. First, we injected female house sparrows with exogenous gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) to maximally stimulate ovarian steroidogenesis. Second, we collected pre-ovulatory follicle tissue and quantified the mRNA expression of four key enzymes of the steroid synthesis pathway: steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), cytochrome P450-side chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1), 17-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD17B1), and aromatase (CYP19A1). Thirty minutes after GnRH injection, androgen concentrations in both the plasma and in the yolks of pre-ovulatory follicles were significantly elevated compared to controls. However, this measure of steroidogenic capacity did not explain variation in yolk testosterone levels, although physiological differences between house sparrows and more widely studied poultry models were revealed by this approach. Steroidogenic enzyme mRNA levels were detectable in all samples and were significantly lower in the most mature pre-ovulatory follicles. Of the four measured genes, CYP19A1 expression exhibited a significant negative relationship with yolk testosterone concentrations in laid eggs, revealing a key mechanism for between-female variation in yolk testosterone. Furthermore, this suggests that any factors which alter the expression of CYP19A1 within an individual female could have dramatic effects on offspring phenotype.  2012 Elsevier Inc."

Moreover, male songs have been shown to shape maternal investment, particularly with regard to egg quality. Artificial manipulation of male attractiveness has been found to affect female sexual preferences and maternal investment. In this regard, supranormal stimuli are thought to increase such responses. The present study was designed to assess whether supranormal acoustic stimuli, known to induce high levels of sexual responsiveness in female canaries, Serinus canaria, could increase maternal investment beyond levels observed in birds exposed to natural songs. Exposure to supranormal songs (G phrases) increased maternal investment: compared to females exposed to moderately attractive (Control) or naturally attractive (A) phrases. Females exposed to supranormal songs laid bigger eggs (egg volume and mass, albumen mass); moreover, females in the G group laid eggs with heavier yolks than females in the Control group. In contrast, no differences were found between groups with regard to testosterone deposition in the eggs. Thus, the adjustment of females' investment in their brood seems to take various forms that appear to be related to different features of males' sexually selected traits, which raises the questions of how and why these different mechanisms have been selected.  2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

The relative length of digit 2 to digit 4 (2D:4D) in adults is thought to reflect the relative concentration of androgens and estrogens during development and has been used as a morphological proxy of developmental hormone exposure, enabling the exploration of the relationships between individual differences in hormone exposure and phenotype. Here, we use this approach and ask whether 2D:4D relates to the responsiveness of the adult hypothalamicpituitary-gonadal axis and to sexually dimorphic structures (wing, tail, and tarsus length) in a common songbird, the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis). Among males, we found a negative relationship between 2D:4D and the ability to elevate testosterone in response to a physiological challenge, an injection of gonadotropin-releasing hormone. We also found age-and sex-specific relationships between 2D:4D and wing, tail, and tarsus length. We found a positive relationship between 2D:4D and body size measures in females, and second-year and older males, but a negative relationship in first-year males. We conclude that individual variation in exposure to developmental hormones, as reflected by 2D:4D, is correlated with adult hormone production ability and sexually dimorphic morphology in adulthood, suggesting that endogenous variation in steroid hormone exposure may have long-term consequences similar to those seen in experimental manipulations.

Boldness and aggressiveness are two personality traits that have been shown to affect fitness. By crossing single males to multiple females, we estimated the heritability of boldness and aggressiveness in the zebrafish, Danio rerio. The additive genetic variance was statistically significant for both traits and the heritability estimates (95 % confidence intervals) for boldness and aggressiveness were 0.76 (0.49, 0.90) and 0.36 (0.10, 0.72) respectively. Furthermore, there were significant maternal effects accounting for 18 and 9 % of the proportion of phenotypic variance in boldness and aggressiveness respectively.

We therefore in- vestigated whether the ER can signal back to acidic orrganelles, using organelle pH as a reporter of NAADP action. We show that Ca2+ released from the ER can activate the NAADP pathway in two ways: first, by stimulating Ca2+-dependent NAADP synthesis; second, by activating NAADP-regulated channels. Moreover, the differential effects of EGTA and BAPTA (slow and fast Ca2+ chelators, respectively) suggest that the acidic organelles are preferentially activated by local microdomains of high Ca2+ at junctions between the ER and acidic organelles. Bidirectional organelle communication may have wider implications for endo-lysosomal function as well as the generation of Ca2+ oscillations and waves.  2013 Morgan et al."

We investigated the cross-generation impact of a moderate heat challenge in chickens. We hypothesized that a warm temperature-within the thermotolerance range- would affect the hormonal environment provided to embryos by mothers, and in turn, affect the morphology and behavioral phenotype of offspring. Methodology/Principal Findings: Laying hens were raised under a standard thermal condition at 21C (controls) or 30C (experimental) for 5 consecutive weeks. A significant increase was observed in the internal temperature of hens exposed to the warm treatment; however plasma corticosterone levels remained unaffected. The laying rate was not affected, but experimental hens laid lighter eggs than the controls during the treatment. As expected, the maternal thermal environment affected yolk hormone contents. Eggs laid by the experimental hens showed significantly higher concentrations of yolk progesterone, testosterone, and estradiol. All chicks were raised under standard thermal conditions. The quality of hatchlings, growth, feeding behavior and emotional reactivity of chicks were analyzed. Offspring of experimental hens (C30 chicks) were lighter but obtained better morphological quality scores at hatching than the controls (C21 chicks). C30 chicks expressed lesser distress calls when exposed to a novel food. Unlike C21 chicks, C30 chicks expressed no preference for energetic food. Conclusion/Significance: Our findings suggest that moderate heat challenge triggers maternal effects and modulate the developmental trajectory of offspring in a way that may be adaptive. This suggests that the impact of heat challenges on captive or wild populations might have a cross-generation effect.  2013 Bertin et al."

Intra-clutch variation of testosterone can shift relative competitive ability of siblings and hence competitive dynamics. In a natural population of great tits, we experimentally investigated the effects and function of maternal testosterone on offspring phenotype in relation to the laying position of the egg in a context of hatching asynchrony. To this end, we created three types of clutches where either the first three or the last three eggs of a clutch were injected with testosterone (T) dissolved in sesame oil, and the remaining eggs with sesame oil only, or where all eggs of a clutch were injected with sesame oil. Increased levels of yolk T in the last-laid eggs resulted in the last-hatched chicks being significantly lighter and smaller than their siblings, while increased levels of T in the first-laid eggs had no direct effect on the first-hatched chicks, but an indirect negative effect on their siblings. Our results suggest that females can potentially adjust offspring phenotype by modulating, over the laying sequence, the amounts of T deposited in the eggs. These results are in contradiction, however, with current hypotheses and previous findings, which suggest that under good conditions higher levels of maternally derived T in the last-laid eggs should mitigate the negative effects of hatching asynchrony.  2013 Podlas et al."

This range of social environments is associated with variation in a number of phenotypic and life-history traits. We investigate whether maternal effects are adjusted accordingly. We found no evidence for the prediction that females might benefit from modifying brood hierarchies through an increased deposition of androgens with laying order. Instead, females appear to exacerbate brood reduction by decreasing the costly production of yolk mass and antioxidants with laying order. Additionally, we found that this effect did not depend on colony size. Finally, in accordance with an expected increased intensity of environmental stress with increasing colony size, we found that yolk androgen concentration increased with colony size. This result suggests that females may enhance the competitive ability of offspring raised in larger colonies, possibly preparing the offspring for a competitive social environment.  2012 Springer-Verlag."

Many researchers have interpreted phenotypic responses as unavoidable negative outcomes (e.g., small birth weight, high anxiety); however, a biased underestimate of the adaptive potential of MDS-induced effects is possible if they are not viewed within an ecologically relevant or a life-history optimization framework. We review the ecological and environmental drivers of MDS, how MDS signals are transferred to offspring, and what responses MDS induces. Results from four free-living vertebrate systems reveals that although MDS induces seemingly negative investment trade-offs in offspring, these phenotypic adjustments can be adaptive if they better match the offspring to future environments; however, responses can prove maladaptive if they unreliably predict (i.e., are mismatched to) future environments. Furthermore, MDS-induced adjustments that may prove maladaptive for individual offspring can still prove adaptive to mothers by reducing current reproductive investment, and benefitting lifetime reproductive success. We suggest that to properly determine the adaptive potential of MDS, researchers must take a broader integrated life-history perspective, appreciate both the immediate and longer term environmental context, and examine lifetime offspring and maternal fitness.  2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS."

We employed a novel two-step cross-fostering experiment to quantify the relative contributions of clutch (i.e., maternal identity) and maternally chosen nest sites to phenotypic variation during three early life stages (incubation, hibernation, dispersal) of the painted turtle (Chrysemys picta). By translocating eggs between nests in the field, we demonstrated that both clutch and nest site contribute to phenotypic variation at hatching. Because hatchling C. picta hibernate inside nests, we performed a second cross-foster to decouple the effects of the incubation nest with that of the hibernation nest. Incubation nest explained little variation in phenotypes at spring emergence, but winter nest site was important. We found no evidence that mothers select nest sites specific to reaction norms of their own offspring, suggesting that females may select nest sites with microhabitats that broadly meet similar requirements across the population. After hibernation, we released hatchlings to assess performance and phenotypic selection during dispersal. Hibernation nest site influenced physiological performance during dispersal, and we detected nonlinear selection on hatchling carapace length. Our experiment demonstrates that nest-site choice has substantial effects on phenotypic variation and fitness across multiple early life stages.  2013 by the Ecological Society of America."

A relationship between parental quality and feeding rate is generally attributed to an active adjustment by parents in order to retain good quality mates or ensure high fitness through raising high-quality offspring. However, the behaviour and need of young may also change with parental quality, and this may affect parental behaviour. A further problem is that most studies have investigated post-hatching parental investment in relation to the secondary sexual signals of males, but not females. In a cross-fostering experiment, we examined the feeding rates of rearing parents in relation to the size and ornamentation of both original and rearing parents in collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis). Using this setup, we could examine whether the observed feeding patterns were the results of the decision of the parents based on their own and their partner's traits or the constraints imposed by the behaviour or need of offspring. When correcting for clutch size and year, we found that feeding rate of both foster parents correlated with the wing patch size of the original female. This implies that original maternal quality had an offspring-mediated indirect effect on investment of foster parents, that is intrinsic nestling quality may constrain parental feeding decisions. This explanation should not be overlooked in future studies on preferential parental investment, and our results also point out that maternal ornaments deserve more attention in such studies.  2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

However, few ecologists are aware of the capacity for maternal GC exposure to translate ecological and environmental stressors into preparative and adaptive programmed offspring responses in free-living systems. We review a growing body of experimental work indicating that circulating maternal GCs link ecological stressors with adaptive programming of the stress axis. Throughout, we emphasise that natural and human-induced ecological stressors play a fundamental role in programming the capacity of individuals, populations and communities to respond to both predictable and unpredictable ecological change via translating maternal adversity into responsive programming of the vertebrate stress axis. To encourage rigorous testing of this paradigm in a broad range of ecological systems, we introduce the principal extrinsic stressors with a recognised potential to alter maternal circulating GC levels. We then review from the biomedical literature regarding the underlying physiological and epigenetic mechanisms of stress-induced programming of individual phenotypes to predict how variation in ecological stressors can produce individual variation in stress axis management. To appreciate the potential evolutionary inertia (i.e. adaptive value) of maternally programmed individual variation, we review key recent studies in free-living systems that test its adaptive function, and then discuss how variation in stress-axis programming may scale up to influence populations and ecological communities. Given the huge potential of this field, it is encouraging that ecologists are beginning to examine how and why maternal GCs translate ecological and environmental stressors into preparative stress axis programming in free-living systems.  2012 The Authors.

More recently, another hormone related to parental care - prolactin - has been suggested as a complementary tool to investigate this question. Indeed, both of these hormones are affected by stressors and are involved in parental decisions, such as deserting the nest. Because of these similarities, it remains unclear what the functional distinction between the prolactin and corticosterone stress responses is. Here, we investigated whether natural variations of the corticosterone and prolactin stress responses are functionally linked in free-living Cape petrel (. Daption capense) parents. If prolactin and corticosterone mediate the same functional response to a stressor and are the proxies of the same response, we predict that corticosterone and prolactin stress responses (1) will be modulated according to the same factors; (2) will affect reproductive performances in the same way; and, (3) of course, will be correlated. Contrary to these predictions, we found that the corticosterone and prolactin stress responses were respectively modulated according to body condition and breeding status. Moreover, prolactin levels, but not corticosterone levels, were related to hatching success in this species. Finally, we did not find any significant correlation between these two stress responses under any circumstances (failed breeders, incubating or chick rearing birds) and this result was overall supported by a review of the existing literature. Therefore, these two stress responses do not seem to be tightly linked and we believe that they may provide complementary pieces of information on parental investment in birds.  2012 Elsevier Inc."

We hypothesized that experimentally food-restricted females with low antioxidant capacity would deposit more protoporphyrin and less biliverdin in their eggshells, resulting in eggshells of reduced brightness but increased colour intensity. Two eggs were collected at the beginning and two at the end of a 2'week period from each of 24 female Japanese quails that were either food restricted or receiving ad libitum food (i.e. controls) during that time. Reflectance spectra were recorded and analysed using spectral shape descriptors, chromatic and achromatic contrasts were computed accounting for avian visual sensitivities, and eggshell pigments were quantified. We examined both spot and background pigmentation and found no significant effect of food restriction on eggshell reflectance. However, food-restricted females in lower body condition increased the deposition of protoporphyrin and decreased the amount of biliverdin invested in their eggshells. We hypothesize that in species laying brownspotted eggshells, females modulate eggshell pigment investment in response to their body condition. According to this hypothesis, we predict that females maintain eggshell colour to limit visible changes that could be detected by predators and thereby conceal their eggs, although this work has yet to be conducted. We suggest that further experimental work on egg camouflage under different environmental conditions will elaborate on the process of pigment deposition and the physiological costs to females of laying heavily pigmented eggshells.  2013.

In contrast, the phenotypes diverged at four nodes both under unstressed conditions and in response to stress: circulating levels of reactive oxygen species (superoxide, H2O 2); liver gene expression of GPX1 and erythrocyte DNA damage. Additionally, allele frequencies for SOD2 diverge from neutral markers, suggesting diversifying selection on SOD2 alleles. This study supports the hypothesis that these life-history phenotypes have diverged at the molecular level in how they respond to stress, particularly in nodes regulating oxidative stress. Furthermore, the differences between the life-history phenotypes were more pronounced in females. We discuss the responses to stress in the context of the associated life-history phenotype and the evolutionary pressures thought to be responsible for divergence between the phenotypes.  2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."

In this review, we examine the relationships between the social environment and the function of the HPA axis in vertebrates. First, we explore the effects of the social environment on glucocorticoid secretion in territorial (primarily non-social) species, with an emphasis on the effects of variation in population density, as modified by environmental factors such as predation risk and food availability. In general, high population density or frequent territorial intrusions are associated with increased glucocorticoid secretion in a wide range of taxa, including mammals, birds, fish and reptiles, although there is considerable variability across species. Second, we consider the effects of social interactions and dominance rank on glucocorticoid secretion in social species, mostly in birds and mammals. We review studies that have detected an association between social status and glucocorticoid levels - sometimes with higher glucocorticoid levels in low-ranking individuals, and sometimes with higher glucocorticoid levels in dominant individuals. The relationship between dominance and glucocorticoid levels varies among species, populations and years, in a manner that depends on the stability of the social hierarchy, environmental conditions, the type of breeding system, and the manner in which high rank is obtained and maintained. Finally, we discuss the concept of allostasis and consider interactions between social effects and other environmental factors, noting that there is relatively little research on these interactions to date. For both non-social and social species, we identify priorities of future research. These priorities include more complete descriptions of HPA function that move beyond measurements of basal glucocorticoid concentrations (which will generally require field experiments), to studies that examine organizational effects of social stressors, that directly test the relationship between HPA function and fitness, and that examine how glucocorticoid responses affect population dynamics. Although several lines of evidence suggest that glucocorticoid responses can affect the fitness of individuals and therefore can alter the dynamics of populations, the effect of glucocorticoid responses on population dynamics remains essentially unstudied.  2012 The Authors.

In this study, we performed a translocation experiment of nestling hybrids between collared and pied flycatchers into the nests of conspecific pairs of their parental species. Our aim was to compare the performance of hybrids with purebred nestlings. Nestling collared flycatchers are known to beg and grow faster than nestling pied flycatchers under favorable conditions, but to experience higher mortality than nestling pied flycatchers under food limitation. The experiment was performed relatively late in the breeding season when food is limited. If hybrid nestlings have an intermediate growth potential and begging intensity, we expected them to beg and grow faster, but also to experience lower survival than pied flycatchers. In comparison with nestling collared flycatchers, we expected them to beg and grow slower, but to survive better. We found that nestling collared flycatchers indeed begged significantly faster and experienced higher mortality than nestling hybrids. Moreover, nestling hybrids had higher weight and tended to beg faster than nestling pied flycatchers, but we did not detect a difference in survival between the latter two groups of nestlings. We conclude that hybrid Ficedula nestlings appear to have a better intrinsic adaptation to food limitation late in the breeding season compared with nestling collared flycatchers.

We quantified begging by its mean intensity (scale 0-7) and mean duration and parental allocation by the number of times each nestling was fed. We found that the intensity and duration of begging were not correlated with nestlings' size (estimated by body mass and tarsus length), condition (estimated from the residual of mass regressed on tarsus length), age, sex, or testosterone concentration, so begging did not appear to be negatively or positively condition dependent. A generalized linear model showed that mean intensity of begging, body condition, and log testosterone concentration were significant predictors of the number of feedings.

Two strains of White Leghorn hens were used: DXL (Dekalb XL), a commercial strain individually selected for egg production and KGB (kind, gentle bird), a strain selected for high group productivity and survivability. Ninety hens (48 DXL and 42 KGB) at 28 wk of age were randomly assigned to either a hot (H: mean = 32.6C) or control (C: mean = 24.3C) treatment and housed in pairs by strain for 9 d. Egg production and quality, behavior, body and organ weights, and circulating hormone concentrations were measured. Heat-stressed hens had lower egg production [adjusted (adj) P < 0.001] than their respective controls. Among H-DXL hens, egg weight tended to be reduced at d 1 and was reduced at d 9 (adj P = 0.007), but was reduced only at d 9 among H-KGB hens (adj P = 0.007). Eggshell thickness was also reduced among H hens at d 9 (adj P = 0.007), especially among H-KGB hens (adj P = 0.01). Plasma triiodothyronine concentration was reduced among Hhens (adj P = 0.01), especially among H-DXL hens (adj P = 0.01). Neither temperature nor strain affected the plasma thyroxine and plasma and yolk corticosterone concentrations. Heat-stressed hens spent less time walking (adj P = 0.001) and more time drinking (adj P = 0.007) and resting (adj P = 0.001) than C-hens. The results indicate that although HS reduced production and caused behavioral changes among hens from both strains, the responses differed by genotype. The data provide evidence that genetic selection is a useful strategy for reducing HS response in laying hens. The results provide insights for conducting future studies to develop heat-resistant strains to improve hen wellbeing, especially under the current commercial conditions.  2013 Poultry Science Association Inc."

When controlling for differences among females in mean egg size, siblings from dominant mothers were initially larger (and had a lower mass-corrected SMR) if they developed from eggs at the rear of the egg mass. However, heterogeneity in the size of siblings from different positions in the egg mass diminished in lower-ranking females. Location of the egg within the egg mass also affected the social dominance of the resulting juvenile fish, although the direction of this effect varied with developmental age.

This process is primarily initiated by activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, leading to the release of corticosteroids into the circulation. In teleosts, cortisol is the primary corticosteroid that is released into the circulation in response to stress. This steroid activates corticosteroid receptors that are ligand-bound transcription factors, modulating downstream gene expression in target tissues. Recent research in zebrafish (Danio rerio) has identified novel roles for cortisol in early developmental processes, including organogenesis and mesoderm formation. As cortisol biosynthesis commences only around the time of hatch in teleosts, the early developmental events are orchestrated by cortisol that is maternally deposited prior to fertilization. This review will highlight the molecular events leading to the development of the corticosteroid stress axis, and the possible role of cortisol in the developmental programming of stress axis function. Use of zebrafish as a model may lead to significant insights into the conserved role of glucocorticoids during early development with potential implications in biomedical research, including fetal stress syndromes in humans.  2012 Elsevier Inc."

The sex steroid hormone testosterone (T) and its metabolites are well-established mediators of male-male aggression, and several lines of evidence suggest that T-mediated mechanisms may apply to females as well. However, a key question is whether mechanisms of female aggression primarily reflect correlated evolutionary responses to selection acting on males, or whether direct selection acting on females has made modifications to these mechanisms that are adaptive in light of female life history. Here, I examine the degree to which female aggression is mediated at the level of T production, target tissue sensitivity to T, or downstream genomic responses in order to test the hypothesis that selection favours mechanisms that facilitate female aggression while minimizing the costs of systemically elevated T. I draw heavily from avian systems, including the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis), as well as other organisms in which these mechanisms have beenwell studied froman evolutionary/ecological perspective in both sexes. Findings reveal that the sexes share many behavioural and hormonal mechanisms, though several patterns also suggest sex-specific adaptation. I argue that greater attention to multiple levels of analysis- from hormone to receptor to gene network, including analyses of individual variation that represents the raw material of evolutionary change-will be a fruitful path for understanding mechanisms of behavioural regulation and intersexual coevolution.  2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

In birds, mothers deposit substantial testosterone into their eggs, which enhances competitive ability of offspring. These maternal testosterone concentrations vary systematically within clutches in different patterns and may enable mothers to adaptively fine-tune competitive hierarchies within broods. We performed a comparative analysis to investigate this hypothesis using a broad set of avian species. We expected species with small size differences among siblings (arising from small hatching asynchrony or slow growth rates) to aim for survival of the whole brood in good years and therefore compensate last-hatching eggs with relatively more testosterone. We expected species with large size differences among siblings (large hatching asynchrony or fast growth rates) to produce surplus young as insurance against failed offspring and to facilitate elimination of redundant surplus young by bestowing last-hatching eggs with relatively less testosterone. As predicted, we found that maternal testosterone compensation to last-hatching eggs is stronger when size differences among siblings become smaller. Maternal testosterone compensation to last-hatching eggs also correlated negatively with hatching asynchrony and growth rates. These findings provide evidence for correlated evolution of several maternal effects that together support different maternal reproductive strategies.  2012 by The University of Chicago."

All other things being equal, the differential pattern of development across the clutch may contribute to hatching asynchrony and subsequent inequity in the competition between brood mates, and ultimately increase variance in the quality and fitness of first- and last-laid offspring. It has been suggested that females might allocate resources differently across the laying sequence to moderate the developmental rate and hatching time of different embryos. We tested this theory in the Zebra Finch Taeniopygia guttata, a common model species for investigating maternal effects in birds. We removed 758 eggs from 160 nests shortly after they were laid and used artificial incubators to control for parental effects and monitor hatching times. Eggs from larger clutches consistently hatched sooner than those from average-sized clutches, demonstrating that the intrinsic properties of an egg can alter the developmental time of embryos. There were also differences in the development time of eggs across the laying sequence, but these patterns were weaker, inconsistent and unrelated to sequential investment across the laying sequence in a straightforward way. This study indicates that maternal resource allocation to eggs across the laying sequence and across clutch sizes can influence development times and play a potentially important role in determining the competitive dynamics of broods.  2013 British Ornithologists' Union."

We studied whether maternal preconception levels of serum glucose and testosterone, and fecal corticosterone metabolites differently influenced male and female pup weight until weaning in field voles (Microtus agrestis). In this species, high maternal preconception serum glucose and testosterone levels have previously been associated with the excess of male pups at birth. Our results suggest that male, but not female, pup weight increases with higher maternal preconception testosterone level whereas high maternal serum glucose level promoted female pup weight only. The level of maternal fecal corticosterone metabolites was not related to pup weight in either sex.

Correlations between parental investment and the sexually selected signals of both an individual and its mate are therefore of central interest in sexual selection. Blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus are an ideal study species to investigate such correlations because they provide substantial amounts of biparental care and possess sexually-selected structural UV coloration that seems to signal attractiveness in both sexes. We investigated whether feeding rates of male and female blue tits were correlated with either their own or their mate's UV coloration, and whether any such correlation was affected by the sex ratio of the brood. We also investigated whether any such correlations were reflected in offspring phenotype. Feeding rates were not correlated with either sex of parent's own UV coloration. However, they were correlated with the mate's UV coloration, but in opposite directions in males and females: females had higher feeding rates when mated to bright UV males, implying differential allocation, while males had lower feeding rates when mated to bright UV females, implying reproductive compensation. These relationships were unaffected by the sex ratio of the brood. In addition, fledgling tarsus length, but not mass, was related to male UV coloration, and to female UV coloration in interaction with male age. These results suggest that both male and female attractiveness influence parental investment of the mate, and that this in turn affects offspring phenotype.

However, the long-term effects of maternal androgens on the development of social behavior, and whether these could interfere with the effects of the endogenous gonadal hormones that mediate sexual differentiation, remain poorly known. To answer these questions, we enhanced yolk testosterone by injecting testosterone (T) in oil into Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) eggs prior to incubation. Vehicle-injected (V) eggs served as controls. From age 3. weeks to 8. weeks, sexual development was measured using morphological and physiological traits, and social behavior was measured, including male-typical sexual behavior. In females, treatment with testosterone boosted growth. Males from T-injected eggs developed an affiliative preference for familiar females and differed from V-injected males in the acoustic features of their crows, whereas sexual interest (looking behavior) and copulatory behavior were not affected. These long-lasting and sex-specific yolk testosterone effects on the development of dimorphic traits, but without disrupting sexual differentiation of reproductive behavior suggest potential organizational effects of maternal testosterone, but acting through separate processes than the endocrine mechanisms previously shown to control sexual differentiation. Separate processes could reflect the action of androgens at different times or on multiple targets that are differentially sensitive to steroids or develop at different rates.  2012 Elsevier Inc."

We found previously that Japanese quail females stressed during laying produced offspring with higher fearfulness, probably related to modulation of testosterone levels in their eggs. Here, we evaluated long-term effects of prenatal stress by analysing reproductive traits of these F1 offspring and, then, the development of their subsequent (F2) offspring. The sexual behaviour of F1 prenatally stressed (F1PS) males was impaired. F1PS females' eggs contained less yolk and more albumen, and higher yolk testosterone and progesterone levels than did F1 prenatal control females. The fearfulness of F2 prenatally stressed quail was greater than that of F2 prenatal control quail.

In particular, the extent to which early stress exposure is detrimental to fitness may depend on its severity, with mild stress exposure actually having a stimulatory and, possibly, beneficial effect through a hormetic response to the stressful stimulus. Oxidative stress is an aspect of stress physiology that has received comparatively less attention than hormones when considering the long-term effects of early life conditions. We therefore need to combine hormesis and oxidative stress in order to better understand how the early environment can help shape a phenotype adapted to the conditions it is most likely to experience in its adult environment. This chapter aims to discuss how hormones and nutrients can shape the redox machinery of the embryo and its future susceptibility to oxidative stress; how hormesis might provide a mechanistic framework for interpreting the long-term effects of early exposure to various stressor magnitudes; and how to reconcile discrepancies among studies. Examples from avian research are especially emphasised throughout the chapter, notably because avian models may have many advantages over mammalian models when addressing the (mal)adaptive effects of early life experiences on adult phenotype.

Here, we show that parent American coots (Fulica americana) practice both strategies by switching from brood reduction to compensation across time. Late-hatching chicks suffer higher mortality only for the first few days after hatching. Later, parents begin to exhibit parental aggression towards older chicks and each parent favours a single chick, both of which are typically the youngest of the surviving offspring. The late-hatched survivors can equal or exceed their older siblings in size prior to independence. A mixed allocation strategy allows parents to compensate for the costs of competitive hierarchies while gaining the benefits of hatching asynchrony.  2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS."

We used continuous recording of nest-cup temperatures to document incubation effort during egg laying at 57 Mountain Bluebird (Sialia currucoides) nests in a high-elevation Wyoming population. We then asked whether such effort predicted the degree to which eggs hatch asynchronously. Although substantial egg heating could begin abruptly late in laying (previously reported as the norm for this species) or even after clutch completion, we found that most (>90%) females began incubation gradually, engaging in a few (usually 1-8), brief (<10 min) bouts of heating on the day they laid their first or second egg. Thereafter, females varied markedly in when they increased incubation effort and by how much. The onset of nocturnal incubation also varied, with females beginning to incubate at night after laying their prepenultimate, penultimate, or last egg and not always initially incubating through the night. As an index of the total amount of heat applied to eggs during laying, we calculated the cumulative number of degrees by which nest-cup temperatures exceeded the threshold temperature required for embryonic development. This value varied by more than 150-fold between nests and explained >50% of the variation in hatching asynchrony. Our results thus provide strong support for the widely held, but rarely tested, assumption that parent birds can have substantial control over the degree of hatching asynchrony by varying the amount of incubation done prior to clutch completion.  2013 The Authors.  2013 Association of Field Ornithologists."

The within season decline in egg weight is attributed to constraints on the ability of birds to acquire the necessary nutrients exogenously during the laying season, requiring the geese to utilise their limited endogenous reserves. The seasonal decline in egg weight is consistent with that in other waterfowl. However, a baseline egg weight level was found here that may be difficult to identify in wild geese, as in nature clutch completion is followed by incubation. The baseline level reflect the minimum egg weight necessary for viable gosling production. In one year old geese egg weight was lower from the genesis of egg laying through the first eight weeks and weight then steadily increased between weeks 9-19 tending towards the adult baseline levels. This is consistent with the maturation of one year old birds and shows that young geese are working towards the production of eggs with a viable egg weight.

We tested the lethal and sub-lethal effects of treated seed ingestion by the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa), a game bird of high socio-economic value in Spain. One year-old partridges (n = 42 pairs) were fed for 10 days in spring (prior to breeding) with wheat treated with difenoconazole (fungicide), thiram (fungicide) or imidacloprid (insecticide), using two doses for each pesticide (the one recommended, and its double to represent potential cases of abuse of pesticides). We investigated the direct and indirect effects on the body condition, physiology, immunology, coloration and subsequent reproduction of exposed partridges. For the latter, eggs were collected, measured and incubated and the growth and survival of chicks were monitored. Thiram and imidacloprid at high exposure doses produced mortalities of 41.6 and 58.3 %, respectively. The first death was observed at day 3 for imidacloprid and at day 7 for thiram. Both doses of the three pesticides caused sublethal effects, such as altered biochemical parameters, oxidative stress and reduced carotenoid-based coloration. The high exposure doses of imidacloprid and thiram also produced a decrease in cellular immune response measured by the phytohemagglutinin test in males. Bearing in mind the limitation of the small number of surviving pairs in some treatments, we found that the three pesticides reduced the size of eggs and imidacloprid and difenoconazole also reduced the fertilization rate. In addition, both thiram and imidacloprid reduced chick survival. These experiments highlight that the toxicity of pesticide-treated seeds is a factor to consider in the decline of birds in agricultural environments.  2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Yet, while external factors are important, the extent of what is evolutionarily possible rests with the mechanisms developed by birds for clutch-size control. Hitherto neglected, these mechanisms generate factors internal to the organism that are central to the origin of evolutionary change. They are related to the fact that a species-specific range of clutch size arises from the differential survival of pre-ovulatory follicles undergoing growth when the signal causing egg laying to end reaches the ovary. Herein, I examine three internal factors that, together with external factors, could impact the evolution of avian clutch size. Each factor acts by changing either the number of pre-ovulatory follicles present in the ovary at the time of follicular disruption or the timing of this event. These changes to clutch size can be explained by the concept of heterochrony. In light of this, the role of phenotypic plasticity and genes determining clutch size is discussed. Finally, to account for the origin of evolutionary change in clutch size, I detail an hypothesis involving a process similar to Waddington's theory of genetic assimilation.  2013 Cambridge Philosophical Society."

Many bird species display complex plumage coloration, but whether this represents one integrated or several independent sexual traits can be unclear. Collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) display melanised and depigmented plumage areas, and the spectral features (brightness and UV chroma) of these are correlated with each other across the plumage. In a 5-year dataset of male and female plumage reflectance, we examined some of the potential information content of integrated, plumage-level colour attributes by estimating their relationships to previous and current year body condition, laying date and clutch size. Females were in better condition the year before they became darker pigmented, and males in better current year condition were also darker pigmented. Female pigment-based brightness was positively, while male structurally based brightness was negatively related to current laying date. Finally, the overall UV chroma of white plumage areas in males was positively associated with current clutch size. Our results show that higher degree of pigmentation is related to better condition, while the structural colour component is associated with some aspects of reproductive investment. These results highlight the possibility that correlated aspects of a multiple plumage ornamentation system may reflect together some aspects of individual quality, thereby functioning as a composite signal.  2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Vulnerability to disease is linked to perturbations in development during critical time periods in fetal and neonatal life. These perturbations are caused by environmental signals, often generated or transduced by the mother. The regulation of mammalian development depends to a large extent on maternal biochemical signals to her offspring. We argue that this adaptation is ancient, and originated with the evolution of lactation. Lactation evolved earlier than live birth and before the extensive placental development of modern eutherian mammals. Milk contains a host of signaling molecules including nutrients, immunoglobulins, growth factors and metabolic hormones. As evidenced by marsupials, lactation originally served to supply the biochemical factors for growth and development for what is essentially a fetus to a weanling transitioning to independent existence. In placental mammals maternal signaling in earliest life is accomplished through the maternal-placental-fetal connection, with more of development shifted to in utero life. However, significant development occurs postpartum, supported by milk. Mothers of all taxa provide biochemical signals to their offspring, but for non-mammalian mothers the time window is short. Developing mammals receive maternal biochemical signals over an extended period. These signals serve to guide normal development, but also can vary in response to environmental conditions. The ancient adaptation of lactation resulted in a lineage (mammals) in which maternal regulation of offspring development evolved to a heightened degree, with the ability to modify development at multiple time points. Modern metabolic diseases may arise due to a mismatch between maternal regulation and eventual circumstances of the offspring, and due to a large proportion of mothers that exceed past evolutionary norms in body fat and pregnancy weight gain such that maternal signals may no longer be within the adaptive range.  2013 Elsevier B.V."

The production of lipidrich maternal yolk precursors may provide a mechanism by which lipophilic steroid hormones can be transported to developing yolks, thus predicting a positive correlation between yolk precursors in mothers and androgen levels in eggs. Using rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome), which produce a two-egg clutch characterized by extreme egg-size dimorphism, reversed hatching asynchrony and broodreduction, we examined correlations between circulating concentrations of the primary yolk-precursor vitellogenin (VTG) and levels of yolk androgens. Previous work in Eudyptes penguins has shown that egg-size dimorphism is the product of migratory constraints on yolk precursor production. We predicted that if yolk precursors are constrained, androgen transport to developing yolks would be similarly constrained. We reveal positive linear relationships between maternal VTG and androgens in small A-eggs but not larger B-eggs, which is consistent with a migratory constraint operating on the A-egg. Results suggest that intra-clutch variation in total yolk androgen levels depends on the production and uptake of yolk precursors. The brood reduction strategy common to Eudyptes might thus be best described as the result of a migratory constraint.  2012 The Royal Society."

An individual's learning performance can be affected by its mother's environment. For example, mothers exposed to stressors, such as restraint and forced swimming, often produce offspring with impaired learning performance. However, it is unclear whether there are maternal effects on offspring learning when mothers are exposed to ecologically relevant stressors, such as predation risk. Here, we examined whether maternal predator-exposure affects adult offsprings' learning of a discrimination task in threespined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Mothers were either repeatedly chased by a model predator (predator-exposed) or not (unexposed) while producing eggs. Performance of adult offspring from predator-exposed and unexposed mothers was assessed in a discrimination task that paired a particular coloured chamber with a food reward. Following training, all offspring learned the colour-association, but offspring of predator-exposed mothers located the food reward more slowly than offspring of unexposed mothers. This pattern was not driven by initial differences in exploratory behaviour. These results demonstrate that an ecologically relevant stressor (predation risk) can induce maternal effects on offspring learning, and perhaps behavioural plasticity more generally, that last into adulthood.  2012 The Royal Society."

We reared male and female moths Plodia interpunctella on either good- or poor-quality food and then also raised their offspring on one of the two diet qualities. We found strong transgenerational effects on immunity: in general, if only one parent received the poor diet, reductions in immunity were observed whether that parent was the mother or the father, and the lowest offspring immune reactivity was observed when both parents received the poor diet. The mechanism behind these effects is not known, but they could be caused either by imprinting, whereby the parent gives the offspring a cue such as an epigenetic mark that changes the offspring phenotype, or by the mother allocating fewer resources to their offspring when the diet was poor. Two lines of evidence point towards imprinting: the strong paternal effects and the observation that the size of these effects was either unchanged or increased when the offspring were fed a good-quality diet themselves. Weight was also reduced when either parent was fed a poor diet, except when both parents had a poor diet and the offspring were raised on good food, contrasting with the increased rates of obesity seen in vertebrates when either parent is raised on a restricted diet. Overall, the effects of parental diet on offspring weight and immune reactivity are substantial and in some cases are equivalent to that of the diet that the offspring itself consumes.  2012 British Ecological Society."

However, both pathways have so far only been studied in isolation, even though maternal effects are known to have significant effects on early development. Thus, maternal yolk hormones - an important mediator of maternal effects - may affect neophobia both through direct effects on neophobic behaviour and/or by affecting the early development. Both pathways may even act in concert. We measured the neophobic response and habituation to novel food, as well as the response to a novel object in 8-months-old canaries (Serinus canaria). All birds hatched from eggs with elevated yolk testosterone levels or control-treated eggs, and grew up in distinct experimentally-manipulated positions within the sibling hierarchy, which allowed us to test whether and how the effects of prenatally elevated yolk testosterone levels on neophobic behaviour vary with the environmental conditions experienced post-hatch. Neither the experimentally-manipulated yolk testosterone levels nor the position within the sibling hierarchy had a direct effect on neophobic behaviour. The elevation of the yolk testosterone levels modulated the neophobic behaviour and the habituation to novel situations of juvenile canaries only in interplay with the experimentally manipulated position in the sibling hierarchy and offspring sex. The strongest increase of neophobic behaviour was observed in individuals that hatched from eggs with elevated yolk testosterone content while growing up in a superior position in the sibling hierarchy - and in males. However, these effects varied with the focal explanatory variable. Based on our results and a review of the literature, we conclude that neither prenatal maternal nor early environmental effects post-hatching form the main source of variation of neophobia in itself, but that the effects observed as well as the inconsistency there of can best be explained by the interaction of different partly unknown pathways.  2012 Koninklijke Brill NV."

In addition to the reproductive characteristics of males and females, fertilization and hatching rates were evaluated for computation of maternal and paternal effects. The variance components were estimated by restricted maximum likelihood, and the Highest Posterior Density (HPD) intervals were estimated for each component. The female contributed more to the total variation than males for the fertilization and hatching rates. The female contributed 26.3% of the total variation in the fertilization rate against 8.9% of males. Regarding the hatching rate, the female contributed 11.9% versus 1.6% of males.

As there was no evidence of 11-HSD or GST activity in ovarian fluid, the findings affirm that ovarian follicles (probably the thecal and granulosa cells) provide a barrier against the transfer of cortisol to the oocytes by forming sulphated steroids, whereas ovulated oocytes and early embryos have a more limited capacity to either metabolize or conjugate cortisol and are therefore more vulnerable at the post-ovulatory and early embryonic stages to increases in exposure to the glucocorticoid.  2012 Society for Reproduction and Fertility."

Human beings, in terms of evolution, are a successful, rapidly multiplying species. Our reproductive physiology would appear to be functioning quite well. However, human gestation is fraught with many poor outcomes for both the mother and fetus that appear to be-if not unique-far more common in humans than in other mammals. High rates of early pregnancy loss, nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, preeclampsia and related maternal hypertension, and preterm birth are rare or absent in other mammals yet quite typical in humans.

Here we test the effects of a predator-induced maternal effect in a predator-free postnatal environment. We manipulated perceived predation-risk for breeding female great tits by exposing them to stuffed models of either a predatory bird or a non-predatory control. Offspring were raised either in an environment matching the maternal one by exchanging whole broods within a maternal treatment group, or in a mismatching environment by exchanging broods among the maternal treatments. Offspring growth depended on the matching of the two environments. While for offspring originating from control treated mothers environmental mismatch did not significantly change growth, offspring of mothers under increased perceived predation risk grew faster and larger in matching conditions. Offspring of predator treated mothers fledged about one day later when growing under mismatching conditions.

Cortisol was microinjected into one-cell embryos to elevate basal cortisol levels during embryogenesis. Elevated embryo cortisol content increased heart deformities, including pericardial edema and malformed chambers, and lowered resting heartbeat post-hatch. This phenotype coincided with suppression of key cardiac genes, including nkx2.5, cardiac myosin light chain 1, cardiac troponin type T2A, and calcium transporting ATPase, underpinning a mechanistic link to heart malformation. The attenuation of the heartbeat response to a secondary stressor post-hatch also confirms a functional reduction in cardiac performance.

In this study we artificially incubated eggs and cross-fostered offspring to manipulate nestlings' position in the hatching order, to identify whether the competitive ability of nestlings is dependent on position in the laying sequence. In both control and experimentally reversed broods, first hatched chicks had a higher survival than last hatched siblings. Yet, nestlings that hatched from eggs laid in the second half of a clutch begged with a greater intensity than nestlings hatched from eggs laid in the first half of a clutch. In natural broods, the greater begging competitiveness of nestlings from later-laid eggs led to a moderation of sibling competition and these nestlings achieved the same body size and weight as nestlings from eggs laid in the first half of the clutch. The lack of a substantial difference in the size and condition of surviving nestlings in respect to laying order suggests that differential resource allocation across the egg-laying sequence partially compensates for hatching last in asynchronous broods and reduces the negative effects of the nestling size hierarchy. The effect of laying order, brood size and experimental treatment also differed for male and female nestlings.

Studying digit ratio in nonhuman laboratory as well as wild vertebrate species may be useful to assess whether different traits may be influenced by a common (e.g. endocrine-related) mechanism and whether digit ratio might be used as a phenotypic indicator for behavioural or fitness-related traits. We examined whether digit ratio (third-to-fourth toe ratio; 3D:4D) may indicate a common mechanism underlying endurance and antipredator behaviour in male painted dragon lizards, Ctenophorus pictus. We have previously shown that 3D:4D is associated with the presence/absence of a yellow throat patch (bib), with males with bibs having higher 3D:4D than those without bibs. In this study we found that 3D:4D predicted antipredator behaviour with individuals with higher 3D:4D having shorter escape response times; however, 3D:4D was not associated with endurance. Endurance and antipredator behaviour were also associated with male coloration. Males expressing a bib had shorter escape response times and lower endurance than those without a bib. Moreover, males with orange head colour had lower endurance compared to yellow-headed and uncoloured males. On the basis of these results, we speculate that the associations between antipredator behaviour, endurance, 3D:4D and male sexual coloration are caused, at least partly, by different underlying mechanisms.  2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

Some differences in eggshell coloration have been reported to co-vary with various measures of maternal condition and these patterns support the hypothesis that, in some bird species, several aspects of eggshell colour (i.e. primary chroma and brightness) function as a signal of maternal and offspring quality to induce greater paternal investment. We directly quantified eggshell pigment concentrations of blackbird Turdus merula and song thrush T. philomelos eggshells and tested how the two key pigments (protoporphyrin IX and biliverdin) co-varied with other eggshell traits and egg constituents as measures of maternal reproductive investment, including total yolk carotenoid concentration, total lipid concentration, yolk mass, and shell thickness. Contrary to predictions, we detected few statistical patterns overall. We found that protoporphyrin IX concentration was negatively associated with blue-green chroma in blackbirds but not in song thrush. The concentration of protoporphyrin IX was significantly greater in blackbirds and also showed different patterns of association with total yolk lipids and yolk carotenoid concentrations between these two species (significant species interaction terms). Our results reveal that it is not appropriate to simply assume in these two avian species that reflectance-based eggshell colour measures are a suitable proxy for eggshell pigment concentrations or can be used as consistent predictors of maternal reproductive investment. These results highlight the need to assess and validate the strength and direction of the statistical relationships between eggshell colour measures, pigment concentrations, and maternal resource deposition in the egg for other species of birds.  2012 The Authors."

Mammalian studies suggest that preand post-natal stress can have different effects (i.e. hyper- or hypo-responsiveness) on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the main mediator of the stress response. In mammals, the physiological intimacy between mother and offspring constrains the possibility to control, and therefore manipulate, maternal pre- and post-natal influences. Here, using the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) as our model, we elevated levels of the glucocorticoid stress hormone corticosterone in ovo and/or in the endogenous circulation of hatchlings. We examined the effects of treatments on corticosterone and glucose stress responses at two different ages, in juvenile and adult quail. In juveniles, corticosterone data revealed a sex-specific effect of postnatal treatment regardless of the previous pre-natal protocol, with post-natally treated females showing shorter stress responses in comparison with the other groups, while no differences were observed among males. In adulthood, birds previously stressed as embryos showed higher corticosterone concentrations over the stress response compared with controls. This effect was not evident in birds subjected to either post-natal treatment or the combined treatments. There were no effects on glucose in the juveniles. However, adult birds previously stressed in ovo showed opposite sex-specific basal glucose patterns compared with the other groups. Our results demonstrate that (1) early glucocorticoid exposure can have both transient and long-term effects on the HPA axis, depending upon the developmental stage and sex and (2) post-natal stress can modulate the effects of pre-natal stress on HPA activity.  2012.

Mothers can favour certain young by conferring on them competitive advantages such as a leading position in the birth sequence, more resources or hormones. Avian mothers create hatching asynchrony within a clutch and at the same time bestow the eggs with different concentrations of androgens that may enhance or counteract the competitive advantage experienced by early-hatching ""core"" young. In siblicidal birds, core young assume a dominant social position in the nest due to their size advantage and when threatened with starvation fatally attack subdominant later-hatching ""marginal"" young. A role for maternal androgens in siblicidal aggression has frequently been suggested but never tested. We studied this in the facultatively siblicidal black-headed kittiwake. We found that marginal eggs contain higher instead of lower concentrations of androgens than core eggs. Surprisingly, exposure to experimentally elevated yolk androgens increased sibling aggression and dominance, even though in nature marginal eggs never produce dominant chicks. We propose the ""adoption facilitation hypothesis"" to explain this paradox. This cliff-nesting colonial species has a high adoption rate: ejected marginal kittiwake chicks frequently fall into other nests containing chicks of similar or smaller size and exposure to yolk androgens might help them integrate themselves into a foster nest.  2012 Muller et al."

However, toxicity assessments can be influenced by food availability, which can alter endpoints in assays including viability, sex ratios and development time. The aim of this study was to determine if food limitation affected the endpoints used in toxicity tests with the Australian model organism, Chironomus tepperi, including responses in offspring. First instar larvae were subjected to food treatments with larval density controlled and offspring were either raised under the same food conditions as their parents or under standard conditions. In lower food density treatments adults in the F0 generation experienced delayed emergence and females produced fewer egg masses. F0 diet affected the performance of F1 to continued exposure and there was evidence that the quality of the offspring was compromised. Although sex ratios were not skewed, males and females responded differently to food limitation, especially in the F1 generation where female development was more delayed. These results demonstrate that endpoints used in toxicity evaluation in C. tepperi also respond to food availability, highlighting the need to control for food in both laboratory and field toxicity studies. Multiple generations should ideally be exposed to stressors under laboratory conditions to elucidate likely long term effects in the field.  2012 Elsevier Inc."

Experiments aimed at investigating the biological effects of EMFs, focused on potential harmful effects on humans, have been mostly carried out in vitro or with animal models in laboratory conditions. By contrast, studies performed on wild animals are scarce. The effects of EMFs created by an electric power line on reproductive traits of a wild great tit (Parus major) population were explored by analysing data gathered during nine breeding seasons. EMF exposure significantly increased clutch size (7%) and egg volume (3%), implying a 10% increase in clutch volume. This indicates an increase in reproductive investment from parent birds exposed to EMFs as compared to the adjacent reference area. These results cannot be attributed to habitat or adult quality differences between the exposed and reference group. Nevertheless, no differences in hatching success or final productivity (fledging and reproductive success or nestling body mass) could be detected. Our study clearly shows that EMFs created by power lines can have biological consequences in wild organisms that live intimately with them. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing an increase in clutch size, and one of the few reporting an increase in egg size, associated with EMF exposure. The possible mechanisms by which great tits invest more under EMF exposure are discussed, and future research directions to evaluate the effect of EMFs on avian reproduction in the wild are suggested.  2012 Elsevier Inc."

Environmental factors can have diverse and often strong effects on reproduction, with obvious ramifications for population fitness. Nevertheless, reproductive traits are often neglected in conservation considerations. Focusing on animals, recent progress in sexual selection and sexual conflict research suggests that reproductive costs may pose an underestimated hurdle during rapid climate change, potentially lowering adaptive potential and increasing extinction risk of certain populations. Nevertheless, regime shifts may have both negative and positive effects on reproduction, so it is important to acquire detailed experimental data. We hence present an overview of the literature reporting short-term reproductive consequences of exposure to different environmental factors. From the enormous diversity of findings, we conclude that climate change research could benefit greatly from more coordinated efforts incorporating evolutionary approaches in order to obtain cross-comparable data on how individual and population reproductive fitness respond in the long term.

Using an experimental approach, we studied the long-term effects of yolk androgens on several phenotypic traits and parental behavior in adult and female collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis). We elevated yolk androgen levels and monitored the experimental recruits the following breeding seasons. Androgen treatment had a sex-dependent effect on adult body condition, yolk androgen-treated males being heavier than control males when controlling for size, a result which may be caused potentially by selective mortality, physiological differences, or different life-history strategies. Androgen treatment did not however affect the expression of sexually selected plumage ornaments (forehead and wing patch size), UV coloration, or parental feeding rate in either sex. Our results suggest that yolk androgens are unlikely to affect sexual selection via plumage characteristics or contribute to breeding success via altered parental care. Yolk androgens do not seem to act as a means for female collared flycatchers to enhance the attractiveness of their sons. The lower return rate previously observed for androgen-treated male offspring compared to controls may therefore not be due to lower mating or breeding success, but may rather reflect lower survival or higher dispersal propensity of yolk androgen-treated males.  2012 Springer-Verlag."

Birds represent excellent models to test such effects as their maternal investment can be quantified in terms of egg quality. Recently, it has been demonstrated that corticosterone (CORT) can be transmitted from a female bird into its eggs. However, there is little published evidence about maternal effects that are mediated by acute stress. In this study, we demonstrated that female great tits Parus major facing an aerial predator during egg formation increased CORT concentration in eggs that were laid the morning after the treatment. By presenting a predator model to each experimental nest twice a day, we found that maternal stress influences corticosterone content in eggs during a time period from albumen production in the magnum until the initial phase of shell secretion, when additional water is added to the egg in the shell gland. We also found a positive correlation between the duration of parental alarm calls and CORT concentration in eggs. In conclusion, the response of female passerines to predatory cues brings about a maternal effect that may have negative consequences for offspring performance. We also suggest that the total duration of the behavioral response to a stressor is an important determinant of CORT levels in the albumen of bird eggs.  2012 Elsevier Inc."

We tested these hypotheses by manipulating attractiveness of male house wrens (Troglodytes aedon) prior to female arrival by adding extra nest sites to territories of some males while leaving control males with only a single nest site. Females laid their eggs sooner in the nests of attractive males, and attractive males were more likely to retain their territory over successive broods and were marginally more likely to obtain a mate for a second brood later in the season than were control males, thereby confirming the effect of our manipulation on male attractiveness. Experimentally enhanced attractiveness also led to increased hematocrit in males. However, there were no consistent differences in the number, size, or quality of eggs laid by females mated to attractive and control males, nor were there any differences in the size, health state, or immune function of nestlings produced from these eggs. There was also no effect of treatment on the number of nestlings surviving to fledging. Collectively, these results are inconsistent with both the differential allocation hypothesis and the compensation hypothesis.

Several studies have analyzed the stochastic, time-dependent causes of variation in longevity, but little information exists from free-ranging animal populations on the effects that environmental conditions and phenotype early in ontogeny have on duration of life. In this long-term (1993-2011) study of a migratory, colonial, passerine bird, the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica), we analyzed longevity and, in a subsample of individuals, lifetime reproductive success (LRS) of the offspring that reached sexual maturity in relation to hatching date, which can affect the rearing environment through a seasonal deterioration in ecological conditions. Moreover, we analyzed the consequences of variation in body size and, for the first time in any species, of a major component of immunity on longevity, both by looking at absolute phenotypic values and at deviations from the brood mean. Accelerated failure time models showed that individuals of both sexes that hatched early in any breeding season enjoyed larger longevity and larger LRS, indicating directional selection for early breeding. Both male and female offspring with large T cell-mediated immune response relative to their siblings and female nestlings that dominated the brood size/age hierarchy had larger longevity than their siblings of inferior phenotypic quality/age. Conversely, absolute phenotypic values did not predict longevity. Frailty modelling disclosed marked spatial heterogeneity in longevity among colonies of origin, again stressing the impact of rearing conditions on longevity. This study therefore reinforces the notion that perinatal environment and maternal decisions over timing and site of breeding, and position in the brood hierarchy can have marked effects on progeny life history that extend well into adulthood. In addition, it provides the first evidence from any bird population in the wild that immune response when nestlings predicts individuals' longevity after sexual maturation.  2012 The Authors.

Together with the maternal uterus, extraembryonic membranes of viviparous (live-bearing) amniotes develop as an endocrine placenta that synthesizes and responds to steroid hormones critical for development. The ability of these membranes to synthesize and respond to steroid hormone signaling has traditionally been considered an innovation of placental amniotes. However, our laboratory recently demonstrated that this ability extends to the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of an oviparous (egg-laying) amniote, the domestic chicken, and we hypothesized that steroidogenic extraembryonic membranes could be an evolutionarily conserved characteristic of all amniotes because of similarities in basic structure, function, and shared evolutionary ancestry. In this study, we examined steroid hormone synthesis and signaling in the CAM of another oviparous amniote, the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis). We quantified mRNA expression of a steroidogenic factor involved in the regulation of steroidogenesis (NR5A1), the key steroidogenic enzymes involved in the synthesis of progestins (HSD3B1), androgens (CYP17A1), and estrogens (CYP19A1), and the receptors involved in the signaling of progestins (PR), androgens (AR), estrogens (ESR1 and ESR2),and glucocorticoids (GR). Furthermore, we performed protein immunolocalization for PR and ESR1. Collectively, our findings indicate that the alligator CAM has the capability to regulate,synthesize, and respond to steroid hormone signaling, thus, supporting our hypothesis that the extraembryonic membranes of Amniota share a unifying characteristic, that is, the ability to synthesize and respond to steroid hormones.  2012 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc."

Little is, however, known about how personality is associated with information use and reproductive success. We tested whether wild social jackdaws, Corvus monedula, show consistent behavioural differences in their exploratory behaviour (in a novel environment in the lab and in their reaction towards a novel object in the wild) and prospecting behaviour (number of visits to conspecific nests). We furthermore examined whether these behavioural traits are linked with each other and predictors of reproductive success. Breeding jackdaws were consistent in their exploratory behaviour within, and in their prospecting behaviour between, years. Exploratory behaviour in the novel environment was correlated with the latency to approach a novel object in the wild but not with the frequency of prospecting at conspecific nests. Highly exploratory males and females and frequently prospecting males produced fewer fledglings than less exploratory individuals or less prospecting males, respectively.

Fish were maintained under experimental conditions for 18 months, and during this period females were randomly sampled every two months for biometric analysis (n=30), blood (n=5/sampling) and ovary (n=5/sampling). After this period EPs females (EPFs) and Cs females (CFs) were submitted to the induced breeding experiments. The results showed that rearing curimbat for such long time in a cage at this stocking density, reduces its growth, plasma E2 levels and vitellogenesis. During vitellogenesis, the mean plasma estradiol levels of CFs were three times lower than those of EPFs (P<0.01). CFs presented poorer results than EPFs for all the examined parameters of reproductive performance. Taken together these data showed that the reduced estradiol levels during vitellogenesis (and the consequently less intense transition from the previtellogenic to vitellogenic phase) and reduced amounts of yolk are mechanisms associated with the formation of low quality oocytes and shortened and delayed breeding season in this species. Moreover, our data showed that the onset of vitellogenesis (six months before the spawning season) must be considered as a key period related to the formation of oocytes of good quality, and adequate management should be provided throughout the year.  2012 Sociedade Brasileira de Ictiologia."

This creates challenges when trying to generalize (e. g. determine if a particular relationship exists based on its average strength, or if it varies in response to theoretically relevant factors). Consequently, accounting for moderating factors is likely to be crucial to explain differences in sexual selection among studies. In principle, given measures of key theoretical parameters we can predict the strength of sexual selection on different sexual signals, the benefits of mate choice, the extent of sex differences (e. g. in immune function or survival) and the likely life history trade-offs between investment into different sexual traits (e. g. sperm vs. courtship) or non-sexual traits (e. g. immune function, traits that increase longevity, parental care). How well does empirical data support theoretical expectations? First, we provide a short history of the use of meta-analysis in sexual selection studies.

The difficulties in obtaining blood samples and the recognition of the stressor effect of blood sampling are primary drivers for the use of minimally invasive sample media. In mammals these include saliva, feces, urine, hair, and milk. In birds, samples include excreta, feathers, egg yolk and albumin. In fish, corticosteroids have been measured in excreta and swim-water. Each of these sample media incorporate corticosteroids in accordance with the processes by which they are formed, and this in turn dictates the periods of adrenocortical activity that each sample type represents. Cortisol in saliva represents a time-frame of minutes, whereas the production of feces may be hours to days depending on the species. The longest time-integrations are for hair and feathers which could be over a period of many weeks. The sample media also determines the structural changes that may occur via processes of conjugation to glucuronides and sulfides, metabolic conversion via enzymatic action, and bacterial breakdown. Structural changes determine the optimum methodologies used to measure corticosteroid hormones. In most sample media, measurement of a specific corticosteroid is a requirement depending on the species, e.g., cortisol in most mammals, or corticosterone in birds. However, in samples involving products of excretion, methodologies that measure a broad range of structurally related compounds are probably optimal. The utility of minimally invasive sample media as biomarkers of stress responses depends on the degree to which the corticosteroid content of the sample represents adrenocortical activity. Commonly, this involves comparisons between corticosteroid concentrations in blood plasma with concentrations in the alternative sample media. This review focuses on the methodological and biological validation of corticosteroid measurements in minimally invasive samples as biomarkers of adrenocortical responses to stress."

We found persistent population differences for both reduced CORT responses and bolder exploratory behavior in birds from the colonist population, as well as significant negative covariation between maximum CORT and exploratory behavior.

Carotenoid pigmented visual signals are among the most extensively studied sexual displays, but evidence regarding hypotheses on how carotenoids ensure signal honesty is mixed. Using a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis of 357 effect sizes across 88 different species of birds, we tested two prominent hypotheses in the field: that carotenoid-dependent coloration signals i) immunocompetence and/or ii) oxidative stress state. Separate meta-analyses were performed for the relationships of trait coloration and circulating carotenoid level with different measures of immunocompetence and oxidative stress state. For immunocompetence we find that carotenoid levels (r = 0.20) and trait color intensity (r = 0.17) are significantly positively related to PHA response. Additionally we find that carotenoids are significantly positively related to antioxidant capacity (r = 0.10), but not significantly related to oxidative damage (r = -0.02). Thus our analyses provide support for both hypotheses, in that at least for some aspects of immunity and oxidative stress state the predicted correlations were found. Furthermore, we tested for differences in effect size between experimental and observational studies; a larger effect in observational studies would indicate that co-variation might not be causal. However, we detected no significant difference, suggesting that the relationships we found are causal. The overall effect sizes we report are modest and we discuss potential factors contributing to this, including differences between species. We suggest complementary mechanisms maintaining honesty rather than the involvement of carotenoids in immune function and oxidative stress and suggest experiments on how to test these.  2012 Simons et al."

All of these pathways may, therefore, form significant sources of variation in maternal effects. Here, we focused on the maternal transfer of carotenoids and vitamin E to the egg yolk, using canaries as a model species. Maternal yolk carotenoids and vitamin E are known to generate significant phenotypic variation in offspring, representing examples of maternal effects. We studied the intra-individual consistency in deposition patterns across two years and the mother-daughter resemblance across two generations in order to estimate the level of heritable variation. The effects of the current environmental conditions were studied via a food supplementation experiment, while the consequences of past environmental conditions were estimated on the basis of the early growth trajectories.Results: There was a significant effect of the current environmental conditions on the yolk carotenoid and vitamin E deposition, but this effect varied between antioxidant components. The deposition of yolk carotenoids and vitamin E were linked to the process of yolk formation. Past environmental conditions did not contribute to the variation in yolk carotenoid and vitamin E levels nor did we find significant heritable variation.Conclusions: The transfer of carotenoids or vitamin E may be an example where current environmental variation is largely passed from the mother to the offspring, despite the numerous intermediate physiological steps that are involved. Differences in the effect of the environmental conditions as experienced by the mother during laying may be due to differences in availability as well as physiological processes such as competitive exclusion or selective absorption.  2012 Mller et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

Several studies demonstrated an effect of corticosterone, the main glucocorticoid in birds, injected into the egg on the developing chick, but the injection of steroids in the egg is far from mimicking the natural distribution of the hormone in the egg. Other studies applied a stressor or corticosterone to the mother. However it is still debated whether an increase of circulating corticosterone in the mother translates into higher concentrations of corticosterone in the egg. Therefore, we investigated in captive barn owls Tyto alba whether circulating corticosterone in egg-laying females elevated within a physiological range, resulted in the deposition of corticosterone in eggs. We found that an increase in circulating corticosterone in the mother within the naturally occurring range translated into elevated concentrations of corticosterone in the yolk of subsequently laid eggs, indicating a specific time frame and yolk layer of corticosterone deposition. We conclude that increasing maternal plasma corticosterone within a naturally occurring range is an efficient tool to increase corticosterone concentration in the egg and to manipulate conditions for the developing embryo.  2012 Elsevier Inc."

Yolk androgens have been shown to affect various offspring traits in the short-term, but fitness consequences for either offspring or parents, a prerequisite for studying the adaptiveness of this maternal effect, are poorly known in the wild. 2.We experimentally elevated yolk androgen levels of whole clutches in a wild population of collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) and investigated the long-term effects of yolk androgens on offspring local recruitment, parental return rate, and timing and success of breeding in both parents and offspring in the breeding season(s) following the manipulation. 3.Yolk androgen elevation lowered the local recruitment rate of male, but not female offspring, but had no effect on any breeding parameters of offspring of either sex. Furthermore, yolk androgen elevation of the clutch had no effect on the return rate or any breeding parameters of the parents. 4.Our results indicate that high yolk androgen levels may impose a potential direct fitness cost for male offspring, but no long-lasting additional indirect fitness costs for parents (direct costs of transferring androgens to eggs not considered). Such a sex-specific cost on offspring could constrain yolk androgen deposition and select for sex-specific deposition mechanisms. 5.As yolk androgen levels in this population are heritable, our results on long-term fitness effect of yolk androgens support the idea that hormone-mediated maternal effects may evolve under selection and thereby affect evolutionary processes.  2012 The Authors.

For species with parental care during embryonic development, offspring receive seasonal cues of the environment from parents that are biased by their parent's fitness (which is not equivalent to offspring fitness). Therefore, mechanisms enabling offspring to detect environmental cues independent of parents should be strongly favoured. 2. We experimentally evaluated the ability of avian embryos to integrate cues of season from photoperiod and maternal environments present in eggs to produce seasonal variation in phenotypes among Franklin's gull (Leucophaeus pipixcan) hatchlings. Eggs were collected early and late in the season and some were separated into their component parts and others were incubated under short (early season) and long (late season) photoperiods. After hatching, we measured the structural size of the chicks and the amount of yolk sac reserves. 3. We found that hatchling size, a phenotype linked with fitness, is sensitive to both egg contents provided by mothers and photoperiod, and development time decreases across the season. The effects of integrating cues of season from eggs and photoperiod on offspring phenotype are complex, and when cues of season from eggs are mismatched with cues of season from photoperiod, alternate phenotypes are created. 4. We also found that seasonal variation in egg size, yolk, albumen or shell content of the eggs do not account for the seasonal maternal egg effect on hatchling size. This seasonal maternal effect could be a result of other egg constituents or reflect heritable variation in timing of breeding that is linked with offspring size. 5. Changes in breeding phenology of adults could result in a mismatch between cues from parents and photoperiod cues of season. For example, if breeding seasons advanced such that late season birds initiate breeding at an early season photoperiod, offspring would then be integrating maternal cues of late season with photoperiod cues of early season and alter their phenotypes. We expect our results to initiate new studies on how vertebrate embryos integrate environmental cues with maternal effects and offspring responses to optimize the expression of offspring phenotype.  2012 The Authors.

In particular, stress or sub-optimal nutrition experienced by the mother during pregnancy has been shown to have wide-ranging and important effects on how her offspring cope with their social, physical and infectious environment. Variation in the conditions for development provided by the reproductive tract or egg, for instance by altered nutritional supply or hormonal exposure, may therefore explain a large degree of variation in many welfare- and productivity-relevant traits. The scientific literature suggests a number of management practices for pre-birth/hatch individuals that could compromise their later welfare. Such studies may have relevance for the welfare of animals under human care, depending on the extent to which real life conditions involve exposure to these practices.

As androgen-mediated maternal effects have long-lasting consequences for the adult phenotype, both mating and reproductive success may depend on the combined effect of MHC genotype and exposure to androgens during early ontogeny. We studied how MHC-based mate choice in ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) was influenced by an experimental in ovo testosterone (T) increase. There was no conclusive evidence of in ovo T treatment differentially affecting mate choice in relation to MHC genotype. However, females avoided mating with males with a wholly different MHC genotype compared with males sharing at least one MHC allele. Females also tended to avoid mating with MHC-identical males, though not significantly so. These findings suggest that female pheasants preferred males with intermediate MHC dissimilarity. Male MHC heterozygosity or diversity did not predict the expression of ornaments or male dominance rank. Thus, MHC-based mating preferences in the ring-necked pheasant do not seem to be mediated by ornaments' expression and may have evolved mainly to reduce the costs of high heterozygosity at MHC loci for the progeny, such as increased risk of autoimmune diseases or disruption of coadapted gene pools.  2012 The Authors.

Several avian studies have revealed that the degree to which an individual's hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responds to stressful stimuli as an adult may in effect have been 'programmed' or set as a result of that individual's corticosterone exposure in ovo or as a nestling. Developmental exposure to corticosterone may also have effects upon avian 'personalities' or coping styles, and evidence from mammalian studies suggests that these long-term effects are mediated epigenetically via altered expression of relevant DNA sequences. Although there does not appear to be a consistent across-species pattern, developmental exposure to elevated corticosterone levels may shape adult coping style with such exposure, resulting in adults that are more timid and with increased HPA axis responsiveness to stress than those individuals that were exposed to relatively little corticosterone as nestlings. Recent work in Florida Scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) has found that baseline corticosterone levels in nestlings at 11 days post-hatch explained 84% of the variation in 'personality' (bold vs. timid) when those individuals were tested at approximately 7 months of age. The overall 'personality' scores at 7-8 months of age were based upon tests that evaluated and combined the Jays' responses to three tests: two startle and one neophobia stimuli. Here, we present findings on some of the factors that contribute to corticosterone levels of nestling Florida Scrub-jays, both within and among broods. Our prior and continuing research, as this overview will present, suggests that maternal attentiveness at the nest and paternal provisioning are important factors that mediate nestling corticosterone levels.  2012 Dt.

We challenged female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) prior to egg laying and then challenged offspring during the nestling and juvenile periods with one of two antigens (keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)). We then tested the effects of maternal and neonatal immune challenges on offspring growth rates and neophobia and learning ability of offspring during adulthood. Neonatal immune challenge depressed growth rates. Neophobia of adult offspring was influenced by a combination of maternal treatment, offspring treatment, and offspring sex. Males challenged with LPS during the nestling and juvenile periods had reduced learning performance in a novel foraging task; however, female learning was not impacted. Offspring challenged with the same antigen as mothers exhibited similar growth suppression and behavioral changes as offspring challenged with a novel antigen. Thus, developmental immune challenges have long-term effects on the growth and behavioral phenotype of offspring. We found limited evidence that matching of maternal and offspring challenges reduces the effects of immune challenge in the altricial zebra finch. This may be a result of rapid catabolism of maternal antibodies in altricial birds. Our results emphasize the need to address sex differences in the long-term effects of developmental immune challenge and suggest that neonatal immune activation may be one proximate mechanism underlying differences in adult behavior.  2012 Elsevier Inc."

Maternal yolk androgens have been suggested to contribute to the competitive superiority of the B-chick in southern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes chrysocome, given their important role in mediating sibling competition in other species. We therefore increased the yolk androgen levels in freshly-laid eggs and examined the consequences for sibling competition - via effects on embryonic developmental times, chick growth and early survival. We placed one androgen-treated egg and one control egg into each foster nest, matching them for mass, laying date and laying order. The androgen treatment did not significantly affect embryonic developmental times or chick measurements at hatching. However, elevated yolk androgen levels benefitted chick growth in interaction with the number of siblings in a brood. Chicks from androgen-treated eggs had faster growth in the presence of a sibling than chicks from control eggs. Under these circumstances they also had a higher survival probability. Thus maternal androgens appear to reinforce the observed hatching pattern, facilitating brood reduction. This contrasts to most previous studies in other species where yolk androgens have been shown to compensate for the negative consequences of delayed hatching within the brood hierarchy.  2012 Poisbleau et al."

In most species studied to date, high levels have been found to increase offspring competitive ability. We measured yolk testosterone in two populations of Redpolls (Carduelis flammea/hornemanni) nesting around Toolik Lake Field Station and in Barrow, Alaska to test three predictions about the patterns of yolk testosterone concentrations. First, we predicted yolk testosterone to increase with laying sequence so as to minimize the deleterious effects of hatching asynchrony on chicks from later hatched eggs in a species without delayed incubation. Second, we predicted yolk testosterone to be higher in Barrow where food is more abundant and Redpoll body condition is higher. Third, we predicted yolk testosterone to correlate positively with egg mass and yolk mass, which are two other indicators of maternal investment. An initial analysis that did not consider egg and yolk mass lent support to the first of these predictions. However, more thorough statistical analysis revealed that relationships between yolk testosterone and laying sequence and between yolk testosterone and site were not direct but rather driven by associations among yolk testosterone, egg mass, and yolk mass. While yolk testosterone concentration itself did not differ between sites, the relationship between yolk testosterone and egg and yolk mass did. Yolk testosterone correlated positively with egg mass at Barrow and showed a significant quadratic association with yolk mass in Toolik. While laying sequence and yolk testosterone appeared to be correlated when egg and yolk mass were not considered, the full statistical model suggests that egg and yolk mass are directly associated with laying sequence while yolk testosterone concentrations are not. These results suggest complicated relationships among egg mass, yolk mass, yolk testosterone, site, and laying sequence that should be taken into account in future studies. They also suggest that deposition of yolk testosterone may be a regulated rather than being a purely passive process.  Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V. 2011."

Given that these asymmetries are under parental control, the obvious question is why parents seem to incite family conflict. Here I show in a model system (an altricial songbird) that family strife in the form of fatal sibling rivalry arises as a consequence of parental investor's appetite for risk: in accord with an axiom of investment theory, obtaining greater potential rewards required taking greater risks. I analyze the risk and reward of investment in different family structures using a tool borrowed from modern portfolio theory, and show that the most successful parents gambled with brood size, placing bets on incipient families that often proved too large.

This prediction is clear when parents produce only one offspring per reproductive attempt, but more complicated when parental resources are shared by several offspring, and parents may potentially influence the resource allocation among offspring as well as their number and sex. Here we present an optimization model to make predictions on how total parental expenditure may relate to the number and sex of offspring at every rank position within the litter or brood as well as the sex ratio of the litter/brood for the case of a large population with stable Fisherian sex ratio. We show that selection for sex ratio adjustment should be stronger for offspring at higher-ranking positions, for which the amount of resources received can be more predictable. Also, the relationship between parental resources devoted to a litter/brood of a given size and the primary sex ratio (proportion of males) is not expected to be a monotonically increasing function but rather a J-shaped relationship, steeper for small litters/broods and more extreme sexual dimorphism. Parental expenditure relates to increased sex ratio only for small variations in parental expenditure and for a given brood/litter size. For variable litter/brood sizes, a general relationship between parental resources and litter/brood sex ratio is not expected, although in practice pooling litters or broods of different sizes may produce negative relationships between parental expenditure and sex ratio of the litter/brood.  2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

Females were randomly assigned to one of four treatments: carotenoid supplementation, GnRH challenge, GnRH challenge + carotenoid supplementation, or control. Carotenoid supplementation significantly increased circulating plasma carotenoid levels and acquired immune system performance, but not innate immunity. GnRH challenges elevated circulating testosterone and carotenoid levels, and induced immunosuppression in females. However, females in the GnRH challenge + carotenoid supplementation treatment had higher cell-mediated immune responses than control females and similar responses to those of carotenoid-supplemented females. Hence, availability of carotenoids in female quail seemed to counteract immunosuppressive effects of GnRH challenges. Our results provide further evidence for synergistic effects of carotenoids and testosterone on endocrine physiology and immune function in female birds. Elevated plasma testosterone or carotenoids levels resulted in increased deposition of those compounds to eggs, respectively. Furthermore, because we found that concentrations of testosterone and carotenoids in yolks were correlated within each treatment group, differential deposition of hormones and carotenoids in eggs may not only respond to surrounding social and environmental conditions, but also to other components of the egg.  2012 Springer-Verlag."

There is also evidence that prolactin can work either inversely or additively with corticosterone to achieve this. Here we test the hypothesis that endogenous corticosterone plays a key physiological role in the control of foraging behavior and parental care, using a combination of exogenous corticosterone treatment, time-depth telemetry, and physiological sampling of female macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) during the brood-guard period of chick rearing, while simultaneously monitoring patterns of prolactin secretion. Plasma corticosterone levels were significantly higher in females given exogenous implants relative to those receiving sham implants. Increased corticosterone levels were associated with significantly higher levels of foraging and diving activity and greater mass gain in implanted females. Elevated plasma corticosterone was also associated with an apparent fitness benefit in the form of increased chick mass. Plasma prolactin levels did not correlate with corticosterone levels at any time, nor was prolactin correlated with any measure of foraging behavior or parental care. Our results provide support for the corticosterone-adaptation hypothesis, which predicts that higher corticosterone levels support increased foraging activity and parental effort.  2012 by The University of Chicago."

Because bill color is dynamic over short periods while plumage color is static over longer time frames, we tested whether these signals have the potential to provide temporal information about immunity and condition. In both sexes, bill color (but not plumage color) was negatively related to leukocyte differential, a measure of recent stress, while plumage color (but not bill color) was positively related to resting metabolic rate. In females, bill color also positively correlated with immunoglobulin Y, a component of acquired immunity, while plumage color positively predicted natural antibody levels, a component of innate immunity. In males, neither bill color nor plumage color predicted immune function, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying these signals vary with sex. Our results demonstrate that dynamic signals such as bill coloration do not merely reflect the same information provided by static signals but that these two classes of signal provide information about different temporal aspects of phenotypic quality. Furthermore, our results indicate that a signal expressed in both sexes has the potential to provide different information depending on the sex of the bearer.  2012 by The University of Chicago.

In addition, we previously described considerable variation in maternal androgen production during gestation in marmosets. Here we tested the association between this variation and variation in offspring rough-and-tumble play patterns in both males and females. We measured testosterone and androstenedione levels in urine samples collected from pregnant marmoset mothers and then observed their offspring's play behavior as juveniles (5-10. months of age). In contrast to findings in rhesus macaques, hierarchical regression analyses showed that higher gestational testosterone levels, primarily in the second semester, were associated with decreased rough-and-tumble play in juveniles, and this relationship appears to be driven more so by males than females.

Therefore, CORT level may mediate consistent behaviours along the shy/bold continuum, and thus, it could serve as a pleiotropic basis for behavioural syndromes. Moreover, behavioural responses to environmental challenges may have consequences for CORT concentrations, which would also result in a correlation between physiology and behaviours even without requiring pleiotropic mechanisms. Accordingly, we investigated the relationship between CORT and behaviour in free-living male collared flycatchers, Ficedula albicollis, using recently developed field assays. More specifically, we characterised novel object avoidance, intraspecific aggression and risk-taking in males and related these correlated behaviours to the concentration of CORT metabolites in droppings measured by enzyme immunoassay. Individuals with higher levels of excreted CORT metabolites had no consistently higher or lower behavioural scores along the shy/bold spectrum, as avoidance of novelty, aggression and risk-taking were not systematically related to CORT metabolite concentrations in the same direction. Moreover, environmental challenges owing to the presence of a novel object, territorial intruder and a potential predator caused no elevation in the level of CORT metabolites. Therefore, we did not find correlative evidence for CORT driving correlated behaviours through pleiotropic effects or for particular behaviours during courtship causing elevation in CORT levels.  2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH."

However, levels of antibodies in adults can vary both quantitatively and qualitatively between individuals and during the course of infection. How infection dynamics and their modification by drug treatment might affect the protection transferred to offspring remains poorly understood. Using the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi, we demonstrate that curing dams part way through infection prior to pregnancy can alter their immune response, with major consequences for offspring health and survival. In untreated maternal infections, maternally transferred protection suppressed parasitaemia and reduced pup mortality by 75 per cent compared with pups from nave dams. However, when dams were treated with anti-malarial drugs, pups received fewer maternal antibodies, parasitaemia was only marginally suppressed, and mortality risk was 25 per cent higher than for pups from dams with full infections. We observed the same qualitative patterns across three different host strains and two parasite genotypes. This study reveals the role that within-host infection dynamics play in the fitness consequences of maternally transferred immunity. Furthermore, it highlights a potential trade-off between the health of mothers and offspring suggesting that anti-parasite treatment may significantly affect the outcome of infection in newborns.  2012 The Royal Society."

In birds, two important routes for such transmission are parental behavior and non-DNA egg constituents such as yolk hormones. Offspring traits subject to parental effects include behavior and endocrine function. Research from the Adkins-Regan lab has used three avian species to investigate maternal effects related to hormones and behavior. Experiments with chickens and Japanese quail have shown that maternal sex steroids can influence sex determination to produce biased offspring sex ratios. Because all birds have a ZZ/ZW chromosomal sex determining system in which the female parent determines the sex of the offspring, these results raise the possibility that maternal steroids can influence the outcome of sex chromosome meiosis. Learning has been shown to influence egg investment by female quail in ways that are likely to alter offspring phenotype. In quail, embryonic and exogenous sex steroids have well established and long-lasting effects on sexual differentiation of behavior during a critical period in ovo, but elevated yolk testosterone has long-term effects on behavior that do not seem to be occurring through an alteration in sexual differentiation. In biparental zebra finches, removal of mothers alters not only later behavior, but also the adult response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to an environmental stressor, as indicated by plasma corticosterone. Birds raised only by fathers have lower levels of mRNA for both glucocorticoid receptors in several brain regions as adults. These studies add to the evidence that one generation influences the behavioral or endocrine phenotype of the next through routes other than transmission of DNA.

The ""maternal manipulation hypothesis"" suggests that females modify their physiology and behavior when gravid to increase offspring fitness, an example of adaptive maternal effects in the narrow sense. The maternal manipulation hypothesis has been tested almost exclusively using studies of reptiles, especially viviparous species. We argue that interpretations of modifications of female reptile behavior and physiology while gravid are hampered by the maternal manipulation hypothesis' exclusive focus on offspring fitness. We suggest broadening the approach of such studies to attempt to determine whether behaviors benefit fitness of the current batch of offspring, or benefit female lifetime reproductive success, or both. Using this approach, researchers acknowledge that females may modify physiology and behavior when gravid to benefit their own lifetime reproductive success, which may, or may not, also enhance fitness of the current batch of offspring. We recommend tests of benefits in reptiles to include the idea that females may increase their lifetime reproductive success by engaging in specific behaviors while gravid, independent of (or in addition to) benefits to offspring. We conclude that a broader view of maternal effects, less focused on offspring fitness and including both mothers and offspring, is the way forward for understanding maternal effects.  2012 by The Herpetologists' League, Inc."

Such consistent expression of behaviour may evolve either when selection favours its integration with less flexible components of the phenotype or when pleiotropic effects produce correlations between behaviours that have different optimal timing of expression. Examining the physiological mechanisms underlying correlated expression of behaviours provides powerful insight into the evolution of personalities by establishing the extent to which pleiotropic effects might limit the independent evolution of distinct behaviours. 2.Here, we investigated proximate mechanisms behind aggressive and non-aggressive personality types in western bluebirds, Sialia mexicana, to determine whether consistency in the expression of aggression is because of shared effects of plasma-circulating androgens on aggression and mating behaviour. 3.We found that androgen concentration was unrelated to variation in both intra- and interspecific aggression even though it was closely linked to variation in male mating behaviour. These results suggest that pleiotropic effects of circulating androgens are unlikely to cause consistent differences among individuals in aggression. 4.These findings suggest that decoupling of the activational effects of hormones on behaviour is an important step in the evolution of personality traits.  2012 The Authors.

Here, we tested these hypotheses by examining how diet during development interacted with diet during adulthood to affect adult sexually selected ornamentation and immune function in male mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). Mallards have yellow, carotenoid-pigmented beaks that are used in mate choice, and the degree of beak coloration has been linked to adult immune function. Using a 22 factorial experimental design, we reared mallards on diets containing either low or high levels of carotenoids (nutrients that cannot be synthesized de novo) throughout the period of growth, and then provided adults with one of these two diets while simultaneously quantifying beak coloration and response to a variety of immune challenges. We found that both developmental and adult carotenoid supplementation increased circulating carotenoid levels during dietary treatment, but that birds that received low-carotenoid diets during development maintained relatively higher circulating carotenoid levels during an adult immune challenge. Individuals that received low levels of carotenoids during development had larger phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced cutaneous immune responses at adulthood; however, dietary treatment during development and adulthood did not affect antibody response to a novel antigen, nitric oxide production, natural antibody levels, hemolytic capacity of the plasma, or beak coloration. However, beak coloration prior to immune challenges positively predicted PHA response, and strong PHA responses were correlated with losses in carotenoid-pigmented coloration. In sum, we did not find consistent support for either the Environmental Matching or Silver Spoon hypotheses. We then describe a new hypothesis that should be tested in future studies examining developmental plasticity.  2012 Butler, McGraw."

Nevertheless, these results are from observations of free-living individuals and therefore, it remains impossible to determine whether these variations result from parental investment or efficiency or both, and whether these variations occur during the prenatal or the postnatal stage or during both. Our study aimed first, to determine whether age had an impact on the expression of maternal breeding care by comparing inexperienced female birds of two different ages, and second, to define how these potential differences impact chicks' growth and behavioural development. We made 22 2-month-old and 22 8-month-old female Japanese quail foster 1-day-old chicks. We observed their maternal behaviour until the chicks were 11 days old and then tested these chicks after separation from their mothers. Several behavioural tests estimated their fearfulness and their sociality. We observed first that a longer induction was required for young females to express maternal behaviour. Subsequently as many young females as elder females expressed maternal behaviour, but young females warmed chicks less, expressed less covering postures and rejected their chicks more. Chicks brooded by elder females presented higher growth rates and more fearfulness and sociality. Our results reveal that maternal investment increased with age independently of maternal experience, suggesting modification of hormone levels implied in maternal behaviour. Isolated effects of maternal experience should now be assessed in females of the same age. In addition, our results show, for first time in birds, that variations in maternal care directly induce important differences in the behavioural development of chicks. Finally, our results confirm that Japanese quail remains a great laboratory model of avian maternal behaviour and that the way we sample maternal behaviour is highly productive.  2012 Pittet et al."

If these two components are determined differently, one plumage patch may potentially convey different aspects of individual quality. Methodology/Principal Findings: We evaluated the effects of genetic and environmental factors on carotenoid-based yellow breast colouration of Great Tit (Parus major) nestlings. By partial cross-fostering, we separated the genetic and pre-natal vs. post-natal parental effects on both the structural and the pigment-based component of carotenoid-based plumage colouration. We also simultaneously manipulated the post-hatching environment by brood size manipulation. The structural component of nestling colouration reflected features of female colouration. On the other hand, the pigment-based component was more affected by rearing conditions presumably representing food quality. While the structural component was related to both origin- and environment-related factors, the pigment-based component seemed to be environment-dependent only. These results support the notion that pigment-based and structural components of feather colouration are determined differently. Conclusions/Significance: Chromatic and achromatic components of carotenoid-based feather colouration reflected different aspects of individual quality and history, and thus may potentially form a multicomponent signal.  2012 Matrkov, Reme."

It is nonetheless unclear whether the amount of maternal antibodies transmitted into egg yolks varies with female quality and egg laying order. In this paper, we investigated the transfer of maternal antibodies against type A influenza viruses (anti-AIV antibodies) by a long-lived colonial seabird, the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis), in relation to fluctuating asymmetry in females, i.e. the random deviation from perfect symmetry in bilaterally symmetric morphological and anatomical traits. In particular, we tested whether females with greater asymmetry transmitted fewer antibodies to their eggs, and whether within-clutch variation in yolk antibodies varied according to the maternal level of fluctuating asymmetry. We found that asymmetric females were in worse physical condition, produced fewer antibodies, and transmitted lower amounts of antibodies to their eggs. We also found that, within a given clutch, yolk antibody level decreased with egg laying order, but this laying order effect was more pronounced in clutches laid by the more asymmetric females. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that maternal quality interacts with egg laying order in determining the amount of maternal antibodies transmitted to the yolks. They also highlight the usefulness of fluctuating asymmetry as a sensitive indicator of female quality and immunocompetence in birds.  2012 Hammouda et al."

This has been explored only in few bird species with carotenoid-based traits. We tested this hypothesis in the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa), a gallinacean with very variable laying capacity. Both sexes display carotenoid-based ornamentation that gradually fades throughout the laying period. Here, the redness of beak and eye rings of captive males was intensified after mating by means of paint. The proportion of females that laid eggs did not differ between treatments. Amongst laying females, those mated with colour-enhanced males (experimental females) tended to lay earlier and produced significantly more eggs than controls, but of similar quality (egg mass and composition). We additionally investigated whether male attractiveness influenced egg components depending on the clutch size and laying sequence. The testosterone level in eggs from experimental females was positively related to the laying order, whereas control eggs did not show any trend.

Of the major avian steroid hormones found in yolk, progesterone is by far the most abundant at oviposition, but has received little research attention to date. In this study, we examine the metabolism of [3H]-progesterone injected into freshly laid European starling eggs throughout the first 5days of development by characterization of radioactivity within the egg homogenate. We also introduce a technique that utilizes a focal, freeze/thaw cycle to prevent embryonic development and allows us to assess the role of the embryo in metabolizing progesterone during early incubation. Two major findings result. First is that [3H]-progesterone is metabolized in eggs possessing a developing embryo, but not in eggs with disrupted embryonic development. Second is that the change in the distribution of radioactivity within eggs possessing an embryo is the result of metabolism of [3H]-progesterone to a more polar form that is subsequently conjugated. Together, these data suggest live embryos are necessary for metabolism of progesterone during early incubation, underscoring the potentially important contribution of embryos to functional modulation or mediation of maternal yolk steroid effects.  2011 Elsevier Inc."

Observations of colored cytoplasm in combination with micromanipulation techniques have suggested the presence of a muscle-forming factor. The molecular basis has been elucidated with the discovery of macho-1. macho-1 mRNA is already present in the unfertilized egg, and translocates to the posterior region of the egg during ooplasmic movements. It encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor that positively regulates the expression of target genes. macho-1-binding cis-elements have been identified in muscle-specific zygotic genes. Maternally localized macho-1 appears to have originated in the ascidian lineage, but it activates a muscle-forming developmental program that is shared by the vertebrates. macho-1 is also involved in establishment of the anterior-posterior axis as a competence factor in mesenchyme induction in the posterior region. It is suggested that translation of the macho-1 protein is initiated at the eight-cell stage, and that the protein is inherited by all descendant blastomeres of the posterior-vegetal region. The macho-1 activities in nonmuscle descendants are suppressed or modified by cell interactions during the cleavage stages. In addition to the primary muscle specified by maternal macho-1, ascidian embryos develop secondary muscle, whose fate is determined by cell interactions. Dozens of maternal mRNAs show similar localization to macho-1, and these are known as postplasmic/PEM RNAs, being also involved in various posterior-specific developmental events. Evolutionary aspects relevant to macho-1 and tail muscle formation are also discussed in this article.  2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Sexing of unincubated eggs would be preferred, but as fertile and infertile blastodiscs cannot be distinguished macroscopically, errors could arise from PCR amplifications of parental DNA associated with the vitelline membrane of infertile eggs. In this study, we stained blastodiscs without the vitelline membrane with Hoechst 33342. This allowed unequivocal distinction between fertile and infertile blastodiscs. Fertile blastodiscs contained thousands of fluorescent nuclei, whereas no nuclei were seen in infertile eggs. In addition, after nucleic acid analysis, fertile blastodiscs yielded much stronger chromosomal DNA and CHD1-targeted PCR bands on agarose gels compared with infertile blastodiscs. These findings indicate that fertile blastodiscs contain much more embryonic DNA than parental DNA, allowing reliable sexing of the fertile eggs. The differences between fertile and infertile blastodiscs in chromosomal DNA and CHD1 PCR banding intensities alone could also be used to distinguish fertile from infertile eggs without using Hoechst staining. We conclude that identifying fertile blastodiscs either by Hoechst staining or by analyzing the yield of chromosomal DNA and CHD1-PCR products, combined with CHD1-targeted PCR amplification, presents an easy and reliable method to sex unincubated eggs.  2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."

Studies of birds show that late breeding attempts generally result in offspring of lower reproductive value, with lower recruitment and long-term survival prospects. Several proximate mechanisms, including a seasonal decline of immune system functioning, may lead to a seasonal decline of offspring fitness. We investigated seasonal variation in offspring quality by subjecting first- and second-brood chicks of a sexually size dimorphic species, the European starling Sturnus vulgaris, to an immune challenge with a bacterial endotoxin (LPS), and evaluated their growth and physiological response in terms of total plasma antioxidant capacity (TAC), concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites and hematocrit. LPS challenge did not affect chick growth or oxidative status. However, hematocrit of second-brood chicks was higher in LPS chicks compared to controls. Body mass halfway through the rearing period (days 8-9 post-hatching), TAC and hematocrit were lower among second- vs. first-brood chicks. Interestingly, sexual dimorphism in body mass at days 8-9 post-hatching markedly differed between broods, first-brood males being 4. 7% and second-brood males 22. 7% heavier than their sisters, respectively. Pre-fledging mortality occurred among second-brood chicks only and was strongly female-biased. Our findings suggest that starling chicks, even if in poor conditions, are little affected by a bacterial challenge, at least in the short-term. Moreover, our study indicates that sex differences in body size, possibly mediated by sex-specific maternal investment in egg size, may heavily impact on pre-fledging survival in a different way in the course of the breeding season, resulting in sex-specific seasonal decline of offspring fitness. Finally, we suggest that levels of circulating antioxidants should be regarded among the proximate causes of the association between timing of fledging and long-term survival in avian species.  2012 Springer-Verlag."

We analyzed variation in clutch, egg and yolk size in relation to the female's condition, date of laying, and position in the sequence of laying. As predicted by energy/nutrient constraints, clutch size and yolk size decreased over the breeding season, though egg mass increased. Females' investment strategy differed with clutch size: their investment in eggs increased with each successive egg in clutches of 4 and 5 eggs but decreased with each successive egg in clutches of 3 eggs. Eggs that were heavier for their size were more likely to hatch than eggs light for their size. Females may make a strategic decision, with high investment in eggs laid early resulting in a short sequence (small clutch) and delayed investment resulting in a long sequence (large clutch). Alternatively, the shift in clutch investment may simply be a consequence of physiology. Better estimates of female body condition are needed for these options to be distinguished.

However, same-aged juveniles can diverge in size due to differences in genotype, environmental conditions, and parental effects and thus may vary in competitive ability. Under food scarcity, competitively inferior juveniles may suffer suppressed growth, whereas under benign conditions, small juveniles may exhibit growth compensation and perform as well as large ones. However, studies testing this while controlling for parental effects are lacking. Here, we hand-raised cichlids, Simochromis pleurospilus, from a wide range of egg sizes and manipulated their size by differential feeding. Afterward, high-and low-ration siblings were kept in groups assigned to either a high-or low-competition environment. We investigated how the degree of competition affected aggressiveness and growth of juveniles with different feeding histories. As predicted, when competition was high, high-ration offspring grew fastest. Interestingly, when competition was weak, low-ration juveniles grew at a similar rate as high-ration ones and many were able to catch up in size. High-ration fish were more aggressive than low-ration ones, and this effect was strongest under high competition. Additionally, in the high-competition environment, received aggression was negatively related to growth, and inflicted aggression correlated positively with the growth of the aggressor. These relationships were absent under low competition. Our findings suggest that the abilities to compensate for early growth depression depend on the prevalent level of competition. Aggression is likely used to monopolize food by juvenile S. pleurospilus; however, when competition is strong, aggression cannot compensate for a size disadvantage.  2012 The Author."

I suggest that some reasons for this relative lack of progress include (a) an increasingly reductionist and centralist (upstream) focus which is more and more removed from ecological/evolutionary context, and from peripheral (downstream) mechanisms that actually determine how phenotypes work (b) a long-standing male-bias in experimental studies, even though the key reproductive traits which contribute most to variation in fitness are female-specific traits (e.g. onset of vitellogenesis, egg size or number). Endocrine systems provide strong candidate mechanisms for regulation of phenotypic variation in single traits, and two endocrine concepts capture the essence of life-history trade-offs: (a) hormonal 'pleiotropy', when single hormones have both positive and negative effects on multiple physiological systems and (b) hormonal conflict between regulatory systems required for different but over-lapping or linked life-history stages. I illustrate these ideas with examples of reproductive anemia, migration-reproduction overlap, and molt-breeding overlap, to highlight some of the tremendous opportunities that exist for comparative endocrinologists to contribute to mechanistic studies of avian reproduction in an evolutionary context.  2011 Elsevier Inc."

Regardless, maternal glucocorticoids are likely to have both costs and benefits that are paid and collected over different developmental time periods. We manipulated yolk corticosterone (cort) in domestic chickens (Gallus domesticus) to examine the potential impacts of embryonic exposure to maternal stress on the juvenile stress response and cellular ageing. Here, we report that juveniles exposed to experimentally increased cort in ovo had a protracted decline in cort during the recovery phase of the stress response. All birds, regardless of treatment group, shifted to oxidative stress during an acute stress response. In addition, embryonic exposure to cort resulted in higher levels of reactive oxygen metabolites and an over-representation of short telomeres compared with the control birds. In many species, individuals with higher levels of oxidative stress and shorter telomeres have the poorest survival prospects.

We investigated the sources of variation of adult antipredator behaviour in the Alpine swift (Apus melba) by making use of long-term behavioural observations on parents and cross-fostered offspring. By applying an 'animal model' approach to observational data, we show that antipredator behaviour of adult Alpine swifts was significantly repeatable over lifetime (r = 0.273) and heritable (h2 = 0.146). Regression models also show that antipredator behaviours differed between colonies and sexes (females were more tame), and varied with the hour and year of capture. By applying a parent-offspring regression approach to 59 offspring that were exchanged as eggs or hatchlings between pairs of nests, we demonstrate that offspring behaved like their biological parents rather than like their foster parents when they were adults themselves. Those findings provide strong evidence that antipredator behaviour of adult Alpine swifts is shaped by genetics and/or pre-hatching maternal effects taking place at conception but not by behavioural copying.  2011 The Royal Society."

Therefore, we tested whether the relative allocation of these two resources in yolks varies according to either the Trivers-Willard, positive or compensatory maternal investment hypothesis. We manipulated male attractiveness using coloured leg bands (red-banded males appear attractive; green-banded males, unattractive) and measured yolk androgens and antioxidants in each egg, egg sex, clutch sex ratio and female condition. While female zebra finches manipulated the balance of androgens and antioxidants within and between clutches in response to mate attractiveness, offspring sex and their own condition, they did not do so in a way that consistently followed any of the hypotheses. Mothers paired with unattractive males allocated a larger antioxidant/androgen ratio to daughters than sons. This pattern was reversed when paired to an attractive male; sons received a larger antioxidant/androgen ratio than daughters. We also found offspring sex ratio decreased with increasing female condition for unattractive males, but not for attractive males. However, without knowing the fitness consequences of the balance of different egg constituents, it is difficult to interpret the patterns consistently in terms of the Trivers-Willard, compensatory and positive investment hypotheses.  2011 Springer-Verlag."

We previously found that cross-fostered great tit (Parus major) chicks of females exposed to increased predation risk were smaller and lighter, but had faster wing growth than control cross-fostered chicks, possibly improving predator-escaping abilities. Here we examined the possible role of maternal steroids deposited in eggs as an underlying mechanism. We collected eggs from female great tits under either experimentally increased predation risk (PRED) or control treatments (CON) and analyzed the concentration of testosterone, androstenedione, and progesterone in the yolks. PRED eggs contained lower levels of testosterone than CON eggs, but levels of androstenedione and progesterone did not differ. The smaller size and mass of chicks found in the previous study may thus be explained by the lower testosterone concentrations, since yolk testosterone is known to boost growth and development. Alternatively, testosterone may act as a modulator of differential investment into morphological traits, rather than a simple growth enhancer, explaining lower body mass in conjunction with the accelerated wing growth. This could possibly occur concurrently with other hormones such as corticosterone.  2012 Elsevier Inc."

We exposed juveniles to parents and predators to measure how induced changes contribute to shoaling behaviour differences between two threespine stickleback species (benthics and limnetics: Gasterosteus spp). We found that limnetics increased shoaling in response to predator attacks, whereas benthics did not alter their behaviour. Care by limnetic fathers led to increased shoaling in both limnetic and benthic offspring. Shoaling helps limnetics avoid trout and avian predation; our results suggest that this adaptive behaviour is the result of a combination of paternal effects, predator-induced plasticity and genetic differences between species. These results suggest that plasticity substantially contributes to the rapid divergence in shoaling behaviour across the post-Pleistocene radiation of sticklebacks.  2012 The Authors.

However, recent studies indicate that the occurrence of extra-pair offspring may generally decline with laying order, possibly because stimulation by eggs induces incubation, which may suppress female motivation to acquire extra-pair paternity. Here we tested whether experimental inhibition of incubation during the laying phase, induced by the temporary removal of eggs, resulted in increased extra-pair paternity, in concert with a later cessation of laying, in blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus). As expected, experimental females showed a more gradual increase in nocturnal incubation duration over the laying phase and produced larger clutches than controls. Moreover, incubation duration on the night after the first egg was laid predicted how extra-pair paternity declined with laying order, with less incubation being associated with more extra-pair offspring among the earliest eggs in the clutch. However, incubation duration on this first night was unrelated to our experimental treatment and independent of final clutch size. Consequently, the observed decline in extra-pair paternity with laying order was unaffected by our manipulation and larger clutches included proportionally fewer extra-pair offspring. We suggest that female physiological state prior to laying, associated with incubation at the onset of laying, determines motivation to acquire extra-pair paternity independent of final clutch size. This decline in proportion of extra-pair offspring with clutch size may be a general pattern within bird species.  2011 The Author(s)."

Although there are discrepancies among 2D:4D studies in birds, the consensus is that birds exhibit the opposite pattern with males having a larger 2D:4D than females. The literature currently lacks substantial information regarding the phylogenetic pattern of this trait in amphibians and reptiles. In this study, we examined 2D:4D in two species of frogs (Oophaga pumilio and Craugastor bransfordii) and two species of lizards (Anolis humilis and Anolis limifrons) to determine the existence and the pattern of the sexual dimorphism. Male O. pumilio and C. bransfordii displayed larger 2D:4D than females in at least one of their two forelimbs. Male A. humilis had larger 2D:4D than females in both hindlimbs, but smaller 2D:4D than females in both forelimbs. Male A. limifrons may also have smaller 2D:4D than females in the right forelimb. Finally, digit ratios were sometimes positively related to body length, suggesting allometric growth. Overall, our results support the existence of the 2D:4D sexual dimorphism in amphibians and lizards and add to the knowledge of 2D:4D trait patterning among tetrapods.  2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

This has been hypothesized to represent a compensatory mechanism for disadvantages of later-hatching chicks - via positive effects of yolk androgens on early competitiveness and growth. However, the costs and benefits of this compensatory strategy probably depend on environmental factors determining the survival chances of the chicks such as the food conditions, which should, therefore, influence maternal yolk androgen deposition. We studied the consequences of manipulated food conditions on the expected level of hatching asynchrony in canaries (Serinus canaria) assigning females to either a low (=LQ) or high quality (=HQ) diet. We measured the incubation behaviour (as incubation attendance) and the yolk androgen deposition in order to investigate whether and how females modulate hatching asynchrony in relation to the food conditions. Females on a HQ diet laid larger and heavier clutches, showed a stronger increase in yolk testosterone content towards the last-laid eggs, but did not alter their incubation attendance. Thus, females on a HQ diet seem to favour the survival of later hatching chicks, as indicated by their yolk testosterone deposition pattern. However, females on a HQ diet laid larger clutches and might need to compensate more in order to achieve a similar degree of hatching asynchrony than females on a LQ diet, given the lack of plasticity in incubation attendance. This suggests that canary females respond to food manipulations mainly via changes in clutch size rather than by altering the degree of hatching asynchrony.  2012 Elsevier Inc."

This sex bias has severe implications: sexes differ in the way they use external cues to organize their life cycles, but often cue in on each other's physiology and behavior. The simultaneous investigation of both males and females within single studies is thus essential. In this review, I begin by illustrating the sex-bias in studies and attempt to explain its origin.

Here we show that parasites can have different consequences for offspring depending on their position in the family hierarchy. We experimentally treated European Shag (Phalacrocorax aristoteli) nestlings with the broad-spectrum anti-parasite drug ivermectin and compared their growth rates with nestlings from control broods. Average growth rates measured over the period of linear growth (10 days to 30 days of age) and survival did not differ for nestlings from treated and control broods. However, when considering individuals within broods, parasite treatment reversed the patterns of growth for individual family members: last-hatched nestlings grew significantly slower than their siblings in control nests but grew faster in treated nests. This was at the expense of their earlier-hatched brood-mates, who showed an overall growth rate reduction relative to last-hatched nestlings in treated nests. These results highlight the importance of exploring individual variation in the costs of infection and suggest that parasites could be a key factor modulating within-family dynamics, sibling competition and developmental trajectories from an early age.  2012 Reed et al."

In vertebrates, developmental exposure to maternal androgen hormones has been shown to impact multiple behavioral and physiological traits of progeny, but the possible consequences of this early exposure in terms of aging-related changes in mortality and fitness remain largely unexplored. Avian eggs naturally contain variable doses of maternal hormones - in particular, androgens - which have documented effects on embryo growth and differentiation as well as adult behavior and physiology. Here, we report that injections of a physiological dose of testosterone (T) into yolks of freshly laid eggs of a small, seasonally breeding songbird, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus), increased survivorship in a semi-natural aviary environment. In addition, survival effects of developmental T exposure were sex-dependent, with males generally having a higher risk of death. Separate analyses for young birds in their first year of life (from hatching up to the first reproductive period the following calendar year) and in adulthood (after the first breeding season) showed similar effects. For first-year birds, mortality risk was higher during the winter than during the period after fledging; for adults, mortality risk was higher during the reproductive than the non-reproductive phase (post-breeding molt and winter). T treatment did not affect nestling body mass, but resulted in higher body mass at 3-4 months of age; T and body mass at this age interacted to influence mortality risk.

Therefore, avian mothers have evolved responses to counteract parasite virulence in offspring via transgenerational defense mechanisms that is the transfer of immune-enhancing substances such as antibodies to their eggs. Another maternal pathway is suggested by the finding that infested great tit mothers produced eggs with lower androgens, since these yolk androgens are immunosuppressive and potentially affect parasite susceptibility of the nestlings. However, whether this pathway is a specific adaptation to infestation with parasites that affect the offspring or an epiphenomenon of lower androgen production in the female due to the parasite effects on the mother itself is as yet unclear. In this study we infested female great tits (Parus major) with sheep ticks (Ixodes ricinus), which are nonnidicolous ectoparasites with low vertical transmission capability, and evaluated the effects on yolk androgen deposition. Tick-infested females did not significantly reduce their deposition of androgens (androstenedione (A 4) and testosterone) compared to tick-reduced females, which is in contrast to a previous study showing a lowered deposition of A 4 and testosterone when females were exposed to the nidicolous hen flea. Thus, females alter their hormone deposition, and thus likely offspring phenotype, when exposed to parasites that also form the parasitic environment of their offspring, but not when temporarily infested with the field-dwelling sheep ticks with low transmission capability. This suggests that selection favored the evolution of an adaptive transgenerational effect by acting mainly on the parasite-induced maternal effect.  2011 Springer-Verlag."

We were interested in if and how nesting density, laying date, and laying order influenced yolk androgens in Western Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia hypugaea (Bonaparte, 1825)) in which nest density varies considerably. In 2006 and 2007, we used radioimmunoassay to quantify the concentrations of testosterone, 5a-dihydrotestosterone, and androstenedione in the egg yolks from one early and one latelaid egg in 47 nests of Burrowing Owls located in the Morley Nelson Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area in southern Idaho. Nesting density had no detectable effect on yolk androgens. Yolk androgens varied temporally and peaked in the middle of the laying season while being low before and after this time period. Within nests, late-laid eggs had higher testosterone and dihydrotestosterone than early-laid eggs; adrostendione exhibited a similar pattern in one but not both years of our study. It is possible that the seasonal pattern in yolk androgens that we observed is related to aspects of mate quality for females or declining chances of fledging success for later nesting females, whereas rises in egg androgens between early and late eggs within clutches could reflect a mechanism to assist nestlings from late-laid eggs that hatch one to several days after their siblings to better compete for resources within the nest or promote survival in the presence of larger siblings."

At 1?h post-lipopolysaccharide challenge, plasma corticosterone concentrations increased in the HET but not in the LET line. The heterophil:lymphocyte ratio rose in both lines at 3?h post-immune challenge, with a more pronounced response in HET quail. Moreover, HET chicks displayed higher IgY levels than LET chicks, suggesting either enhanced passive immunoprotection or stimulated endogenous antibody production. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the genetic selection for high egg testosterone content positively influences growth and, simultaneously, does not limit the acute phase response in young quail.  2012.

A large number of studies have identified several direct costs to females of sexual harassment including energy expenditure and reduced foraging ability. However, the fitness consequences of sexual harassment for descendants have rarely been investigated. Here, we manipulated the level of sexual harassment and mating rate in two groups of female guppies, Poecilia reticulata, a live-bearing fish in which sexual conflict over mating rate is particularly pronounced. Each female was allowed to interact with three males for one day (low sexual harassment, LSH) or for eight days (high sexual harassment, HSH) during each breeding cycle throughout their life. Female lifetime fecundity did not differ between the groups, but we found a strong effect on offspring fitness. HSH females produced (1) daughters with smaller bodies and (2) sons with shorter gonopodia, which were less attractive to females and less successful in coercive matings than their LSH counterparts. Although these results may be influenced by the indirect effects of sex ratio differences between treatments, they suggest that sexual harassment and elevated mating rate can have negative cross-generational fitness effects and more profound evolutionary consequences than currently thought.  2011 The Author(s).

Prenatal maternal effects in birds can be mediated by yolk steroid hormones that influence subsequent offspring development. Studies have focused mainly on the influence of laying females' living conditions on yolk hormonal contents, and rarely on the effects of individual characteristics. Here, we investigated prenatal influence of parent age on yolk steroid levels and on offspring phenotype. We compared Japanese quail at two different ages: at the beginning of their reproductive cycle (11. weeks old: age 1) and six months later, after egg production peak (37. weeks old: age 2). Egg composition, reproductive outcomes, and offspring growth, sexual development and behaviour were studied at both ages. We found that laying rate, fertility and chick survival rates declined between age 1 and age 2. Age 2 eggs had relatively lighter shells and higher yolk plus albumen contents; they also had lower testosterone contents. Age 2 offspring weighed more at hatching than did age 1 offspring; subsequently their growth patterns differed and their sexual development was more precocious. Age 2 offspring were less emotional than age 1 offspring when encountering a novel environment, and they appeared more sensitive to social separation. Our study shows, for the first time in a bird species, a strong impact of parental age on offspring phenotype, and especially on behaviour, an impact that is possibly mediated via modulation of yolk testosterone content.  2011 Elsevier Inc."

In the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), we identified a colour ornament that is under sexual selection and appears to have a heritable basis. Hence, by engaging in extra-pair copulations with highly ornamented males, females could, in theory, obtain genes for increased offspring attractiveness. Indeed, sons sired by extra-pair partners had larger ornaments, seemingly supporting the genetic benefit hypothesis. Yet, when comparing ornament size of the social and extra-pair partners, there was no difference. Hence, the observed differences most likely had an environmental basis, mediated, for example, via differential maternal investment of resources into the eggs fertilized by extra-pair and social partners. Such maternal effects may (at least partly) be mediated by egg size, which we found to be associated with mean ornament expression in sons. Our results are consistent with the idea that maternal effects can shape sexual selection by altering the genotype-phenotype relationship for ornamentation. They also caution against automatically attributing greater offspring attractiveness or viability to an extra-pair mate's superior genetic quality, as without controlling for differential maternal investment we may significantly overestimate the role of genetic benefits in the evolution of extra-pair mating behaviour.  2011 The Royal Society."

Within-clutch variation in egg composition has been proposed to reflect an adaptive maternal strategy influencing sibling competition. In species with brood reduction, mothers should reinforce brood hierarchies due to hatching asynchrony and favour senior chicks by making first-laid eggs larger, richer in nutrients, with higher testosterone and carotenoid levels and lower corticosterone concentrations than last-laid eggs [parental favouritism hypothesis (PFH)]. Moreover, mothers that are of better quality and/or experience better feeding conditions during laying are expected to increase their deposition of resources to the egg, resulting in differences between clutches [investment hypothesis (IH)]. Several components may act together to provide an optimal reproductive strategy, but studies of variation in different egg components in the same egg are relatively rare. We analysed egg size, testosterone and corticosterone concentrations and carotenoids measured as yolk colour between and within clutches for the facultative siblicidal Black-legged Kittiwake Rissa tridactyla. First-laid eggs were larger, contained lower testosterone, higher yolk colour score, and similar corticosterone levels than last-laid eggs. Thus, only differences in egg size and yolk colour supported the PFH. We used within-clutch egg size dimorphism as an indicator of the quality of the mother or the feeding conditions during laying. In support of the IH, we found that mothers of better quality or that experienced better feeding conditions deposited more corticosterone into their eggs. High corticosterone levels may benefit nestlings when there is no brood reduction but high sibling competition is present. We found no support for the hypothesis that egg components are mutually adjusted to each other and we discuss the possible reasons for this.  2011 Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V."

We made the following four observations: (1) Females participate in 94% of total nest attentiveness (time that eggs were incubated).

They are thought to have evolved to translate the environmental conditions experienced by the mother into adaptive phenotypic variation of the offspring. However, the integration of environmental cues allowing adaptive responses requires some form of plasticity that depends on the interaction of the maternal phenotype and her environment. In birds, maternal yolk hormones represent such a pathway for maternal effects, and their adaptive significance depends thus on the plasticity in maternal yolk hormone deposition. We studied sources of variation in yolk testosterone deposition, focusing on the often neglected contribution of the (partly heritable) maternal phenotype. We investigated consistency and heritability of yolk testosterone deposition in captive canaries of which the F1 generation was raised in foster nests and analyzed the potential effects of the early developmental conditions. We found significant female consistency across years in egg mass, yolk mass and total amount of yolk testosterone but not in yolk testosterone concentrations. Females varied the yolk testosterone concentrations of their eggs across years mainly via changes in yolk mass. The heritable variation in egg mass, yolk mass and amount of yolk testosterone but not yolk testosterone concentrations was within the range of previous studies, but not significantly different from zero. Finally, the growth of the daughters as nestling had a significant effect on their yolk testosterone deposition at adulthood indicating the transgenerational potential for environmental effects - via the effects of yolk hormones on offspring development.  2011 Elsevier Inc."

Therefore, females often produce smaller eggs when environmental conditions for offspring are favourable, which is subsequently compensated for by accelerated juvenile growth. How this rapid growth is modulated on a molecular level is still unclear. As the somatotropic axis is a key regulator of early growth in vertebrates, we investigated the effect of egg size on three key genes belonging to this axis, at different ontogenetic stages in a mouthbrooding cichlid (Simochromis pleurospilus). The expression levels of one of them, the growth hormone receptor (GHR), were significantly higher in large than in small eggs, but remarkably, this pattern was reversed after hatching: young originating from small eggs had significantly higher GHR expression levels as yolk sac larvae and as juveniles. GHR expression in yolk sac larvae was positively correlated with juvenile growth rate and correspondingly fish originating from small eggs grew faster. This enabled them to catch up fully in size within eight weeks with conspecifics from larger eggs. This is the first evidence for a potential link between egg size, an important maternal effect, and offspring gene expression, which mediates an adaptive adjustment in a relevant hormonal axis.  2011 The Royal Society."

In birds, the period shortly after hatching is an energetically demanding stage characterized by rapid growth in body size and organ systems, including the immune system. Availability of carotenoids for the growing nestlings may be of particular importance and potentially limiting at this stage of development. We tested the hypothesis that the availability of carotenoids for the embryo in the egg and in the diet of nestlings limits the condition and immune responses of nestling house wrens (Troglodytes aedon Vieillot 1809), a species with melaninbased plumage pigments. In one experiment, nestlings within females' second broods were randomly assigned to receive either a control or a lutein supplement (2008); in a second experiment, females, before their first broods, were either induced to lay additional eggs or not induced, and nestlings within both kinds of broods were supplemented as in the first experiment (2009). There were no significant effects of lutein supplementation on nestling condition or phytohemagglutinin response. There was a significant effect of lutein supplementation on nestling mass in 2008, but the difference was opposite to that predicted. Moreover, even when breeding females were stressed by inducing them to lay supernumerary eggs, lutein supplementation of nestlings had no effect on the size or condition of nestlings hatching from these eggs. These results suggest that maternally derived lutein in the egg and that provided in the diet of nestlings are not limiting to normal development and to the components of the immune system involved in the phytohemagglutinin response of nestling house wrens.  2012 by The University of Chicago."

Most evidence suggests that short-term global change may involve increasing occurrences of extreme events, therefore the immediate response of individuals will be determined by physiological capacities and life-history adaptations to cope with extreme environmental conditions. Here, we consider the role of hormones and maternal effects in determining the persistence of species in altered environments. Hormones, specifically steroids, are critical for patterning the behaviour and morphology of parents and their offspring. Hence, steroids have a pervasive influence on multiple aspects of the offspring phenotype over its lifespan. Stress hormones, e.g. glucocorticoids, modulate and perturb phenotypes both early in development and later into adulthood. Females exposed to abiotic stressors during reproduction may alter the phenotypes by manipulation of hormones to the embryos. Thus, hormone-mediated maternal effects, which generate phenotypic plasticity, may be one avenue for coping with global change. Variation in exposure to hormones during development influences both the propensity to disperse, which alters metapopulation dynamics, and population dynamics, by affecting either recruitment to the population or subsequent life-history characteristics of the offspring. We suggest that hormones may be an informative index to the potential for populations to adapt to changing environments.  2012 The Royal Society."

With the exception of male Southern giant petrels (Macronectes giganteus), prolactin secretion and moult in Northern (Macronectes halli) and female Southern giant petrels conformed to those observed in all other avian species, with the initiation of moult coincident with decreases from peak prolactin levels. However, male Southern giant petrels began moulting early in incubation when prolactin was increasing and had not yet peaked, which suggests a requirement of prolactin for incubation behaviour and a dissociation of prolactin from moult. Corticosterone showed little seasonal variation and no relationship with moult. When comparing prolactin, corticosterone, and moult in failed vs. active breeders, we found that failed breeding enabled a more rapid down-regulation of prolactin, thus facilitating a more rapid moult.

We investigated the quantitative genetics of a carotenoid-based color patch, the ventral plumage of mature great tits (Parus major), in a wild population. Carotenoid-based colors are often suggested to reflect environmental variation in carotenoid availability, but numerous mechanisms could also lead to genetic variation in coloration. Analyses of individuals of known origin showed that, although plumage chromaticity (i.e., color) was moderately heritable, there was no significant heritability to achromaticity (i.e., brightness). We detected multiple long-lasting effects of natal environment, with hatching date and brood size both negatively related to plumage chromaticity at maturity. Our reflectance measures contrasted in their spatiotemporal sensitivity, with plumage chromaticity exhibiting significant spatial variation and achromatic variation exhibiting marked annual variation. Hence, color variation in this species reflects both genetic and environmental influences on different scales. Our analyses demonstrate the context dependence of components of color variation and suggest that color patches may convey multiple aspects of individual state.  2011 by The University of Chicago."

Many yellow-red conspicuous traits are coloured by carotenoid pigments, and in some species they are displayed at a very young age. In nestling birds, the functions and proximate mechanisms of carotenoid-pigmented traits are probably different and not as well known as those of adults. Here we investigated how Montagu's harrier (Circus pygargus) nestlings within structured families used a limited resource, carotenoid pigments, and whether they used these for increasing coloration (deposition in integuments) or for mounting a response to a phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) challenge, which measures pro-inflammatory potential and aspects of cellular immune responsiveness. We manipulated carotenoid availability, using dietary carotenoid supplementations, and show that when supplemented, nestlings primarily allocated supplemental carotenoids to increase their coloration, irrespective of their sex, but depending of their position within the brood. Responses to PHA challenge were condition-dependent, but depending on carotenoid availability. Moreover, how nestlings allocated carotenoids depended on their rank within the brood, which in turn influenced their level of carotenoid limitation (first-hatched nestlings being less constrained than later-hatched nestlings). We discuss why nestlings would use supplemental carotenoids for increasing bare parts coloration rather than for responding to a PHA challenge, and the potential benefits for doing so in a parent-offspring communication context.  2011 The Linnean Society of London."

A growing number of studies suggest that female ornaments are linked to maternal quality and influence male mate choice. These findings challenge the traditional male-biased view of sexual selection and the hypothesis that female ornaments are the outcome of a genetic correlation with male ornaments. To further test the hypothesis that female traits have a function, it is now essential to investigate their honesty and to determine how signalling and reproduction interact in females. If female traits are honest indicators of quality, then they are likely to have a specific signalling function. 2. We investigated whether carry-over effects of reproduction might ensure the honesty of plumage colour signalling of a bird species with conspicuous UV-blue and yellow coloration, the blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus. Reproductive effort was manipulated by removing clutches, thereby forcing both sexes to reproduce twice and to raise chicks later in the breeding season when food is less abundant. In the year following this manipulation, we investigated the change in plumage in experimental and control males and females. The change was measured in the two putative feather ornaments, the UV-blue cap and the yellow breast, and another feather trait probably less likely to be sexually selected: the wing length. We also tested whether higher-quality females had their coloration less affected by the experiment. 3. We found that control but not manipulated males and females increased their signal towards UV. In addition, in the manipulated group, females that were able to lay more eggs had their UV-blue coloration less affected by the treatment. For yellow coloration, we found that manipulated yearlings but not manipulated adults decreased their yellow chroma in comparison with control. Lastly, our results show that the condition of the manipulated females tended to be positively correlated with yellow chroma. 4. These results show that the trade-offs between reproduction and signalling can ensure the honesty of conspicuous plumage traits in female and male blue tits. In addition, they suggest that female traits have the potential to evolve under sexual selection in this and other bird species.  2011 The Authors.

Nestlings raised under high quality food conditions may have a higher begging intensity due to their higher need associated with a fast growth trajectory. Likewise, lower begging intensity by nestlings raised on low quality food might result from a general delay in development, or nestlings adjusted their begging to behavioural adjustments made by parents as a response to the different diets. These findings highlight that begging signals can be affected by a complex set of factors and expands the classical view of signalling need. Begging call rates can increase with offspring condition and with their expectations about the quality of food that can be provided by the parents.  2011 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden."

In addition to a genetic component, social status may be influenced by environmental factors including maternal effects such as prenatal hormone exposure. Maternal effects on traits determining social status have previously been examined in species where mothers provide parental care for relatively few offspring and therefore directly influence postnatal development. However, the generality of conclusions arising from these investigations is unclear because species that employ different reproductive strategies have not been studied. 2.We investigated the hypothesis that egg steroid hormone levels influence the social status of juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta). We manipulated intra-clutch levels of cortisol and testosterone in eggs from 15 mothers using dilute hormone baths at the time of fertilization and examined their effects on traits that correlate with social status in juveniles [including standard body size, aggression, competitive ability and standard metabolic rate (SMR)]. 3.Hormone treatment did not affect whole-animal or mass-corrected SMR at the critical developmental stage when juveniles switch from reliance on a maternally provisioned yolk sac to independent feeding. However, juveniles from cortisol-treated eggs were smaller at this developmental stage. They were also less aggressive than, and subordinate to, fish from untreated eggs in socially competitive conditions, even after correcting for the observed effect of cortisol on body size. Egg testosterone treatment resulted in a likely pharmacological or toxicological dose with subsequent effects on both body size and behaviour in independently feeding juveniles. 4.Results from this study demonstrate that variation in the amount of cortisol deposited in eggs by spawning females influences juvenile social status and performance. The effects of elevated egg cortisol in fish are similar to the actions of embryonic glucocorticoids reported in other vertebrate taxa with very different reproductive strategies, suggesting a widespread mechanism for the effects of maternal stress on offspring. Possible adaptive aspects of this relationship are discussed.  2011 The Authors. Functional Ecology  2011 British Ecological Society."

Females can differentially allocate resources in their eggs as a response to the environment experienced during the laying period, including the quality of their mate. To assess the importance of female selection on egg composition in the red-legged partridge, we tested breeding females in a choice trial in which they were allowed to choose between males. After the choice trials, the females were mated with their preferred male (P group), with a non-preferred one (NP group) or with a randomly selected male (RND group). Eggs laid by females of the three groups did not differ significantly in mass, shape, yolk, albumen or shell weight. Moreover, there was no significant difference in egg lysozyme concentration (an important albumen antimicrobial component). There was a significant difference in egg characteristics in relation to position in the laying order, with last-laid eggs being heavier and more spherical. Last-laid eggs contained more albumen but their shell was lighter and the albumen contained less lysozyme. This study shows that partner attractiveness may not influence the characteristics of egg quality, and that in this partridge species the females are able to invest in large clutches without a decrease of egg size but with a progressive decrease of egg quality.  2011 Dipartimento di Biologia Evoluzionistica dell'Universit, Firenze, Italia."

In birds, sex-specific maternal effects can be mediated by predictable gradients of rearing conditions due to hatching asynchrony, egg laying date, order and mass, and brood sex ratio. In this study, we analysed the growth and survival consequences of experimentally reduced hatching asynchrony and order per se and in conjuction with other maternal effects (laying date, egg mass and sibling sex ratio) in yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) chicks of either sex. Survival of male chicks in synchronised broods was reduced compared to that of their sisters and that of male chicks in control broods, whereas survival of females but not that of males declined with hatching order independently of hatching synchronisation treatment. Survival of female but not male chicks declined with egg mass. In addition, survival of individual chicks, independently of their sex, was positively predicted by the proportion of females among their siblings. Hatching synchronisation resulted in larger average body size and in a weaker dependence of body mass on hatching order, suggesting that by modulating hatching asynchrony parents can effectively tune the size hierarchy among the offspring. Thus, survival of yellow-legged gull chicks of either sex was differentially affected by maternal effects as mediated by hatching asynchrony, hatching order as well as egg mass, which constitute predictable gradients of pre- or post-natal environmental conditions potentially under parental control.  2011 Dipartimento di Biologia Evoluzionistica dell'Universit, Firenze, Italia."

Thus, matrotrophic species have smaller yolk volume than lecithotrophic species. Innate immune response of offspring at birth, which is important in protection against disease and parasites, may be influenced by the degree of reproductive investment of carotenoids, such as -carotene. However, to date, no study has investigated the effects of maternal carotenoid intake during reproduction on the innate immune responses of offspring in reptiles. 2.Some matrotrophic viviparous (live-bearing) reptiles provide significant support for embryogenesis through both yolk and placenta. These species are excellent models for research into the evolutionary transitions from lecithotrophic reproduction (i.e. supply of resources from the yolks, e.g. birds) to highly matrotrophic reproduction (i.e. direct supply of most resources from the mother, e.g. mammals). 3.We used high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to examine carotenoid concentration in newly ovulated eggs of a matrotrophic viviparous lizard (Pseudemoia entrecasteauxii). Most eggs did not contain any carotenoids, including -carotene. 4.We then experimentally manipulated maternal -carotene availability (i.e. supplementation of -carotene in the diet or no supplementation) during gestation and investigated innate immune response of offspring (i.e. tissue swelling and proportion of monocytes in response to antigenic stimulation) at 2days after birth. Subsequently, we investigated the effects of post-natal -carotene intake on innate immune response of offspring using reciprocal transplant experiments in which we manipulated offspring -carotene availability for 2weeks after birth. This experimental design also allowed us to assess the persistence of effects of maternal -carotene effects on innate immune response in offspring. We found that the immune response as measured by the proportion of monocytes was enhanced by high maternal -carotene intake during gestation, and this effect persisted for 2weeks after birth. Furthermore, post-natal -carotene intake enhanced innate immune response. 5.The maternally transferred -carotene via the placenta during embryogenesis may be an important physiological adaptation to counter the costs of a reduction in organic substances supplied in the yolk that occurs as matrotrophy evolves.  2011 The Authors.

Most attention has been paid to the possibility that females gain genetic benefits from EPC, and fitness comparisons between maternal half-siblings are considered to be a defining test of this hypothesis. Recently, it was shown that these comparisons may be confounded by within-brood maternal effects where one such effect may be the distribution of half-siblings in the laying order. However, this possibility is difficult to study as it would be necessary to detect the egg from which each chick hatched. In this study, we used a new approach for egg-chick assignment and cross-fostered eggs on an individual basis among a set of nests of the collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis. After hatching, chicks were ascribed to mothers and therefore to individual eggs by molecular genetic methods. Extra-pair young predominated early in the laying order. Under natural conditions, this should give them a competitive advantage over their half-siblings, mediated by hatching asynchrony. However, we experimentally synchronized hatching, and after this treatment, extra-pair young did not outperform within-pair young in any studied trait including survival up to recruitment and several indicators of reproductive success and attractiveness. We obtained only modest sample sizes for the last two traits and did not test for extra-pair success of male offspring. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility of advantages of extra-pair young during the adult phase of life. However, our data tentatively suggest that the more likely reason for females' EPCs is the insurance against the infertility of a social mate.  2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."

In both protostome and deuterostome taxa, cytasters have been described to develop during oogenesis from vesicles of nuclear membrane that move to the cortical cytoplasm. They become associated with several cytoplasmic components, and participate in the reorganization of cortical cytoplasm after fertilization, patterning the antero-posterior and dorso-ventral body axes.Presentation of the hypothesis: The specific resemblances in the development of cytasters in both protostome and deuterostome taxa suggest that an independent evolutionary origin is unlikely. An assessment of published data confirms that cytasters are present in several protostome and deuterostome phyla, but are absent in the non-bilaterian phyla Cnidaria and Ctenophora. We hypothesize that cytasters evolved in the lineage leading to Bilateria and were already present in the most recent common ancestor shared by protostomes and deuterostomes. Thus, cytasters would be an ancient and highly conserved trait that is homologous across the different bilaterian phyla. The alternative possibility is homoplasy, that is cytasters have evolved independently in different lineages of Bilateria.Testing the hypothesis: So far, available published information shows that appropriate observations have been made in eight different bilaterian phyla. All of them present cytasters. This is consistent with the hypothesis of homology and conservation. However, there are several important groups for which there are no currently available data. The hypothesis of homology predicts that cytasters should be present in these groups. Increasing the taxonomic sample using modern techniques uniformly will test for evolutionary patterns supporting homology, homoplasy, or secondary loss of cytasters.Implications of the hypothesis: If cytasters are homologous and highly conserved across bilateria, their potential developmental and evolutionary relevance has been underestimated. The deep evolutionary origin of cytasters also becomes a legitimate topic of research. In Ctenophora, polyspermic fertilization occurs, with numerous sperm entering the egg. The centrosomes of sperm pronuclei associate with cytoplasmic components of the egg and reorganize the cortical cytoplasm, defining the oral-aboral axis. These resemblances lead us to suggest the possibility of a polyspermic ancestor in the lineage leading to Bilateria.  2011 Salinas-Saavedra and Vargas; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

The emergence of theories of self-organisation required progress in several areas including chemistry, physics, computing and cybernetics. Two parallel lines of development can be distinguished which both culminated in the early 1970s. Firstly, physicochemical theories of self-organisation arose from theoretical (Lotka 1910-1920) and experimental work (Bray 1920; Belousov 1951) on chemical oscillations. However, this research area gained broader acceptance only after thermodynamics was extended to systems far from equilibrium (1922-1967) and the mechanism of the prime example for a chemical oscillator, the Belousov-Zhabotinski reaction, was deciphered in the early 1970s. Secondly, biological theories of self-organisation were rooted in the intellectual environment of artificial intelligence and cybernetics. Turing wrote his The chemical basis of morphogenesis (1952) after working on the construction of one of the first electronic computers. Likewise, Gierer and Meinhardt's theory of local activation and lateral inhibition (1972) was influenced by ideas from cybernetics. The Gierer-Meinhardt theory provided an explanation for the first time of both spontaneous formation of spatial order and of self-regulation that proved to be extremely successful in elucidating a wide range of patterning processes. With the advent of developmental genetics in the 1980s, detailed molecular and functional data became available for complex developmental processes, allowing a new generation of data-driven theoretical approaches. Three examples of such approaches will be discussed. The successes and limitations of mathematical pattern formation theory throughout its history suggest a picture of the organism, which has structural similarity to views of the organic world held by the philosopher Immanuel Kant at the end of the eighteenth century.  2011 The Author(s)."

BCIs are calculated from ratios of mass divided by a morphometric(s) or residuals of a regression between mass and a morphometric(s). The morphometrics used in BCIs must accurately represent structural size to reliably index energy reserves and, ideally, BCIs should be validated with comparisons to true fat and protein reserves. Many studies of American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) have included BCIs in ecological analyses; unfortunately, few studies have reported how well morphometrics represented structural size or provided validation of BCIs relative to independent measures of energy reserves. We evaluated relationships between several morphometrics and mass to better understand which morphometrics may best represent structural size for two kestrel populations: captive birds at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and free-living kestrels in southwestern Idaho, U.S.A. We also compared BCIs based on different morphometrics with subjective (visual) fat scores. Our data showed few strong (r > 0.5) correlations between morphometrics and few strong correlations between each morphometric and mass. Moreover, correlations between morphometrics and mass depended on sex and location. Similarly, not all BCIs had statistically significant, positive correlations with subjective fat scores and correlations varied between sexes, suggesting that the reliability of each BCI differed between males and females. The morphometrics that best represent structural size most likely differ between males and females, and information from both sexes should not be combined to create one size measure for kestrels. Unless BCIs for specific American Kestrel subpopulations are validated, mass and additional qualitative information, such as fat scores, may be the most appropriate indicators of fat and protein stores.  2011 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc."

This is due to theirindispensability in several life-preserving physiological processes. In many species,however, carotenoids serve also as the main pigments colouring various ornamentalstructures engaged in mate choice. Although intensively studied by biologists, theevolutionary causes for sexual selection mediated by carotenoid-based ornaments remainunclear. Much of the evidence currently available indicates that carotenoids may signaliseindividual's health status. But how is this achieved? Why a substantial level of variabilitystill exists among individuals despite the long-term natural selection posed on thesetraits? Indeed, one of the most puzzling questions of modern evolutionary ecologyconcerns the physiological mechanisms preserving the honesty of the signalling throughcarotenoid-pigmented traits. A number of different hypotheses has been proposed toexplain this phenomenon. One of the most widely accepted hypotheses connects ornamental health signalling via carotenoids with their antioxidative function in theanimal bodies. According to this view, carotenoids important for protection of theorganism against oxidative damage are irreversibly destroyed in the antioxidative processand hence only healthy animals with sufficient carotenoid intake and low oxidativeburden may afford elaborated ornamentation. However, most recent findings cast somedoubts on this explanation. Carotenoids are not the only antioxidants available in thetissues and most probably they are not even the most important ones. Novel alternativehypotheses based on indirect signalling and the handicap principle appear to provide apossible key to resolve the riddle. If carotenoids deposited into ornamental tissuesindicate the presence of other substances than carotenoids themselves or if carotenoidcleavage into toxic products causes additional harm to the animal health then honesty ofthe carotenoid-based signalling may be preserved. Given that carotenoids are commonlyused as dietary supplements, research in this field is not only a matter of an academicimportance but may provide valuable implications both for animal and human foodproduction and pharmacy.  2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

We tested the relationship between temporal change in mean arrival date of migratory birds since 1960 and concentrations of 2 antioxidants in the eggs of 14 species of birds. Only egg concentration of vitamin E was a significant predictor of advancement in spring arrival date. Furthermore, we experimentally manipulated egg content of vitamin E in barn swallows Hirundo rustica and subsequently recorded arrival date of yearling male recruits. Arrival date advanced significantly by >1 standard deviation due to treatment, providing experimental evidence for a relationship between egg concentration of vitamin E and subsequent migration behavior. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that maternal effects have played an important role in the evolution of bird migration.  Inter-Research 2011."

Maternally deposited hormones affect the embryo and chick's physiology and behaviour. It has been observed that progesterone, a hormone present at higher levels than other steroid hormones in egg yolks, is negatively related to body mass in embryos, chicks and adults. A differential within-clutch progesterone deposition could therefore be linked to the size hierarchy between siblings and to the resulting brood reduction. We tested whether yolk progesterone levels differed between eggs according to future parental ability to feed the entire clutch in wild rockhopper penguins Eudyptes chrysocome. This species presents a unique reversed egg-size dimorphism and hatching asynchrony, with the larger second-laid egg (B-egg) hatching before the smaller first-laid egg (A-egg). Yolk progesterone levels increased only slightly with female body mass at laying. However, intra-clutch ratios were not related to female body mass. On the other hand, yolk progesterone levels increased significantly with the date of laying onset for A-eggs while they decreased for B-eggs. Early clutches therefore had proportionally more progesterone in the B-egg compared to the A-egg while late clutches had proportionally less progesterone in the B-egg. We propose that females could strategically regulate yolk progesterone deposition within clutches according to the expected food availability during chick growth, an adaptive strategy to adjust brood reduction to conditions. We also discuss these results, relating to yolk progesterone, in the broader context of other yolk steroids.  2011 Poisbleau et al."

We found significant variation among populations in most egg components, but ca. 90% of the variation was among individuals within populations. Population however explained 40% of the variation in carotenoid levels. In contrast to our hypothesis, we found geographical trends only in carotenoids, but not in any of the other egg components.

The size and mass of eggs increased through the laying sequence whilst the concentration of carotenoids significantly decreased across the laying sequence.

Some of these effects have been attributed to the release of glucocorticoids, and individual variation in these stress hormones is related to a number of traits. Correlated traits are often clustered and used to define the proactive and reactive stress coping styles. Although stress coping styles have been identified in a number of animal groups, little is known about the coupling between stress coping style and offspring characteristics. In the present study, plasma cortisol levels in ovulated mothers and cortisol levels in non-fertilized eggs from two rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) strains selected for high (HR) and low (LR) post-stress plasma cortisol levels were compared. Offspring characteristics such as egg size, larval growth, and energy reserves also were compared between the two strains. Maternal plasma and egg cortisol levels were correlated, but no difference between the HR and LR strains was detected in either parameter. LR females produced larger eggs, and larvae with larger yolk sacs compared to HR females, however no differences in larval body size (excluding the yolk) was detected between strains. Considering that the HR and LR strains have a number of correlated behavioral and physiological traits that resemble the reactive and proactive stress coping styles, respectively, the results suggest that proactive mothers invest more energy into their offspring, producing larvae with larger energy reserves. It is possible that larger energy reserves in proactive larvae support the energy requirement for establishing and defending territory in salmonid fish. Furthermore, in the present study we found a positive relationship between mother plasma cortisol and egg cortisol; however neither mother plasma cortisol nor egg cortisol differed between strains. These results indicate that cortisol endowment from the mother to the offspring plays a minor role in the transfer of the behavioral and physiological traits which separates these strains.  2011 Elsevier Inc."

Understanding patterns of deposition is critical for better insight into the significance of maternal effects. Here we investigated how egg yolk antioxidants (lutein, zeaxanthin, -carotene, vitamin A and E) related to environmental conditions and parental characteristics in great tits Parus major using data from three breeding seasons. Male and female traits included condition, age and multiple feather ornaments, both carotenoid- and melanin-based (carotenoid and UV chroma of yellow breast feathers, area of black breast band, white cheek immaculateness). Yolk mass increased with ambient temperature during laying, laying date, and the area of male black breast band. Lutein, zeaxanthin, and vitamin E increased with laying date. Total antioxidants increased with female age, immaculateness of female white cheek patch, and UV chroma of carotenoid-based yellow breast feathers of the social mate. These patterns were thus consistent with 1) environmental effects on yolk mass and composition, 2) higher quality females depositing more antioxidants, and 3) differential allocation of resources in females in relation to male ornamentation. Overall, environmental factors, female traits, and male traits all had an influence on egg yolk characteristics in this socially monogamous songbird.  2011 The Authors."

This implies that the effects of maternal yolk hormones should vary with the post-hatching environment, but to date such context-dependency has largely been ignored. We experimentally increased yolk testosterone concentrations in canary eggs and simultaneously manipulated the post-hatching context via an experimental tick-infestation of the chicks. This allows us to evaluate the context-dependency of hormone-mediated maternal effects, as it has previously been shown that ectoparasites alter the maternal yolk androgen deposition. The experimental tick infestation reduced growth in chicks from sham-treated eggs, indicating harmful effects of this ectoparasite in canaries. Chicks from testosterone-treated eggs were not affected in their development by ticks, suggesting lower ectoparasite vulnerability. But this may also be due to the fact that experimentally elevated yolk testosterone levels impaired growth even under parasite-free conditions. This contrasts previous studies, but these studies often manipulated first laid eggs, while we used eggs of subsequent laying positions. Later laid eggs are presumably of lower quality and contain higher yolk testosterone concentrations. Thus, the effects of elevated yolk testosterone on growth may be dose-dependent or vary with the egg quality, suggesting prenatal context-dependency.  2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

American redstart Setophaga ruticilla males who overwinter in high quality habitats arrive early to breed and subsequently produce more offspring than late arrivers. Since many migratory species overlap vernal migration with the physiological transition to breeding, we examined if breeding preparation plays a role in this seasonal interaction. We tested the hypothesis that early arriving male redstarts from high quality winter habitats are in superior breeding condition by simultaneously measuring winter habitat quality (stable-carbon isotopes) and breeding preparation (circulating androgen, cloacal protuberance (CP) diameter) upon arrival at breeding grounds. Compared with late arrivers, early arriving males were from higher quality winter habitats and had higher androgen, but smaller CPs. Males arriving with higher androgen were in more advanced physiological migratory condition, as measured by haematocrit. Early arrivers were more likely to successfully breed, but there was no significant relationship between androgen upon arrival and breeding success. One possible explanation for these relationships is that androgen measured during arrival is most relevant in a migratory context, such that birds with high androgen may benefit from effects on migratory condition, positively influencing fitness through earlier arrival.  2011 The Authors."

Testosterone is an important physiological mediator of these signals as these ornaments are testosterone dependent. Experimental manipulation of circulating testosterone in females suggests that similar mechanisms are at work in plumage ornaments of females. However, hormone manipulations typically result in testosterone levels that are far higher than physiological concentrations experienced by females. Thus, it remains unclear whether natural variation of testosterone levels would be sufficient to generate variation in female plumage coloration. A signaling value of plumage ornamentation is particularly important in females of sex-role reversed species, in which females are the more competitive sex. We examined the relationship between plumage coloration, body condition, and circulating testosterone in female barred buttonquails (Turnix suscitator), a classically polyandrous species. Even though female testosterone levels were low, they were strongly positively related with body condition and the size and blackness of the melanin throat patch. In males, no such relationships were apparent, suggesting that females may have an enhanced sensitivity for testosterone or its metabolites. These unique results reveal that a hormonal mechanism may be involved in sex-role reversal in this species.  2011 The Author.

Despite the growing interest in fitness consequences of acute adrenocortical responses, it has not been determined to what extent the act of mating provokes such responses in females. We used female Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) to determine to what extent any increase in corticosterone (CORT) is specific to actually mating with a male compared to visual and auditory contact with a male, and compared to social interaction with a female. We also asked if greater mating experience decreases the CORT response. We assessed how body condition of the individuals and their behavior during testing contributed to the variation in CORT response. As an additional reference for CORT increase we used a restraint procedure which resulted in the highest CORT. Our results show that females mating with a male have plasma CORT concentrations significantly increased from the baseline, which is not the case in females interacting with a male without the possibility of mating. Greater previous mating experience does not affect the CORT change caused by sexual interaction. Interestingly, social interaction with a female elicited a similar CORT response as mating with a male, which suggests that the effect on CORT was due to direct social interactions per se and not specific to the act of mating. Behavior during social and sexual interactions did not predict the CORT response, but larger females exhibited lower baseline and response CORT concentrations. We suggest that the lesser adrenocortical response of larger females might be related to their better control of the course of mating and might help them to adjust their reproductive investment, as reported in earlier studies.  2011 Elsevier Inc."

This process of sexual selection has profound implications for many life-history decisions, including sex allocation. For example, females with attractive partners should produce more sons, because these sons will inherit their father's attractiveness and enjoy high mating success, thereby yielding greater fitness returns than daughters. However, previous research has overlooked the fact that there is a reciprocal feedback from life-history strategies to sexual selection. Here, using a simple mathematical model, we show that if mothers adaptively control offspring sex in relation to their partner's attractiveness, sexual selection is weakened and male ornamentation declines. This weakening occurs because the ability to determine offspring sex reduces the fitness difference between females with attractive and unattractive partners. We use individual-based, evolutionary simulations to show that this result holds under more biologically realistic conditions. Sexual selection and sex allocation thus interact in a dynamic fashion: The evolution of conspicuous male ornaments favors sex-ratio adjustment, but this conditional strategy then undermines the very same process that generated it, eroding sexual selection. We predict that, all else being equal, the most elaborate sexual displays should be seen in species with little or no control over offspring sex. The feedback process we have described points to a more general evolutionary principle, in which a conditional strategy weakens directional selection on another trait by reducing fitness differences."

In avian species, context-dependency of maternal effects may result in variation in egg composition, as well as in differential patterns of covariation among selected egg components, according to, for example, position in the laying sequence or offspring sex. We investigated variation in major classes of egg yolk components (carotenoids, vitamins and steroid hormones) in relation to egg size, position in the laying sequence and embryo sex in clutches of the Yellow-legged Gull (Larus michahellis). We also investigated their covariation, to highlight mutual adjustments, maternal constraints or trade-offs in egg allocation.Results: Laying sequence-specific patterns of allocation emerged: concentration of carotenoids and vitamin E decreased, while concentrations of androgens increased. Vitamin A, estradiol and corticosterone did not show any change. There was no evidence of sex-specific allocation or covariation of yolk components. Concentrations of carotenoids and vitamins were positively correlated. Egg mass decreased along the laying sequence, and this decrease was negatively correlated with the mean concentrations of carotenoids in clutches, suggesting that nutritionally constrained females lay low quality clutches in terms of carotenoid content. Finally, clutches with smaller decline in antioxidants between first- and last-laid eggs had a larger increase in yolk corticosterone, suggesting that a smaller antioxidant depletion along the laying sequence may entail a cost for laying females in terms of increased stress levels.Conclusions: Since some of the analyzed yolk components (e.g. testosterone and lutein) are known to exert sex-specific phenotypic effects on the progeny in this species, the lack of sex-specific egg allocation by mothers may either result from trade-offs between contrasting effects of different egg components on male and female offspring, or indicate that sex-specific traits are controlled primarily by mechanisms of sexual differentiation, including endogenous hormone production or metabolism of exogenous antioxidants, during embryonic development.  2011 Rubolini et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

However, this may have resulted from the failure of empirical tests to identify large and predictable fitness returns to females from strategic adjustment. Here, we test the effect of diet quality and maternal condition on facultative sex ratio adjustment in the color polymorphic Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae), a species that exhibits extreme maternal allocation in response to severe and predictable (genetically-determined) fitness costs. On high-quality diets, females produced a relatively equal sex ratio, but over-produced sons in poor dietary conditions. Despite the lack of sexual size dimorphism, nutritionally stressed foster sons were healthier, grew faster, and were more likely to survive than daughters. Although these findings are in line with predictions from sex allocation theory, the extent of adjustment is considerably lower than previously reported for this species. Females therefore have strong facultative control over sex allocation, but the extent of adjustment is likely determined by the relative magnitude of fitness gains and the ability to reliably predict sex-specific benefits from environmental (vs. genetic) variables. These findings may help explain the often inconsistent, weak, or inconclusive empirical evidence for adaptive sex ratio adjustment in vertebrates.  2011 The Author(s).

One very important factor that can promote long-term changes in phenotype is restriction of food intake (dietary restriction, DR). 2.Recently, it has been shown that DR may induce an increase in antioxidant and repair mechanisms as a result of hormetic responses. Interestingly, the induction of antioxidant and repair mechanisms may be triggered by transitory increases in reactive oxygen species. Dietary-derived antioxidants, such as vitamin E, may be important to determine the compensatory effect of DR. 3.To investigate the effect of DR on attenuation of oxidative damage, we manipulated dietary intake (by restricting food ingestion) and antioxidant availability (by vitamin E supplementation) during the first days of life of yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) chicks. We then measured oxidative status and body mass during the early development of chicks. 4.We found that an early short event of food shortage strongly affected the oxidative status of the chicks and their growth patterns. We observed less oxidative damage to proteins and DNA in dietary restricted chicks, after the period of food restriction, than in non-restricted chicks. Unexpectedly, vitamin E supplementation did not suppress the hormetic effect of DR, but instead increased it. 5.These novel results support the idea that short events of DR during early development induce a reduction in oxidative damage in wild animals. The results suggest that DR promotes the induction of an early hormetic response in some antioxidant defence processes and/or repair mechanisms. These findings have important implications for our understanding of how early conditions may shape the phenotype of an organism, and also for the study of evolutionary trade-offs during early growth.  2011 The Authors.

This appraisal is notably influenced by the possibility of an individual to exert control over an aversive event. Although the fact that environment controllability decreases emotional responses in animals is well established, far less is known about its potential trans-generational effects. As the levels of avian yolk hormones can vary according to the mother's environment, we hypothesized that housing environment of mothers would modulate the quality of her eggs and in turn her offspring's behaviour. Two groups of female Japanese quail were constituted: a group that had access to a place to hide in their home-cage (Hd, n = 20) and a group that had nowhere to hide (NoHd, n = 20) when stressed. Both groups were submitted to daily human disturbances for a twenty-day-period. Hd females produced eggs with both less testosterone and androstenedione than did NoHd females. The emotional and social reactivity of Hd females' offspring were lower and their growth was slower than those of NoHd females' offspring. Our results show that a minor difference in housing environment had substantial effects on eggs and offspring. The presence of a shelter probably helped quail to cope with daily human disturbances, producing less reactive offspring. This transgenerational effect caused by an opportunity to hide could lead to applications in care of laboratory animals, conservation biology and animal welfare.  2011 Guesdon et al."

The developmental and organizational effects of egg hormones can extend into adulthood and affect behavioral and morphological traits involved in sexual and reproductive behavior, with important consequences for offspring fitness. In this study, we injected testosterone (T) in egg albumen of captive ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) eggs. We then assessed the consequences for chick growth, cell-mediated immunity, and multiple male secondary sexual traits at maturity by comparison with a control group. We also compared the covariation between traits in the two experimental groups. We found that control males had redder wattles than males from T-injected eggs, suggesting that attractiveness and reproductive success of the offspring might vary depending on maternal transfer of T to the eggs. T treatment also modified the covariation between cell-mediated immunity and wattle coloration and between the area of the wattle and the expression of another secondary sexual trait, the ear tufts. These effects are likely to translate into fitness differences among the offspring if mate acquisition depends on the simultaneous expression of several traits that are differentially affected by the same maternal contribution. Maternal effects mediated by egg hormones might affect the fitness of the offspring not only by directional modification of phenotypic traits, but also by facilitating or inhibiting their covariation. This suggests the possibility that female choice based on the relative expression of multiple secondary sexual traits exerts a pressure on how maternal transfer of androgens contributes to developmental programs.  2011 Springer-Verlag."

In the feeding test, there were no differences between the two treatment groups in total feeding score or number of pellets eaten, but offspring from the cortisol-implanted females made more unsuccessful feeding attempts than offspring from control females. In dominance tests, there was no difference between controls and cortisol-treated fish regarding propensity to become socially dominant.

We reviewed experimental temperature studies investigating the links between parents and progeny, asking questions regarding the taxa studied, broodfish used, offspring traits examined, experimental durations and research motivations. We identified forty-one peer-reviewed articles examining the effects of pre-spawning adult temperature holding on offspring. These studies showed a strong focus on the order Salmoniformes (46% of studies) and aquaculturally driven research (66%). The use of wild broodfish was rare (12%) and the majority of experiments (83%) did not examine offspring consequences beyond hatch. We also identified 56 articles investigating how incubation temperature and parental influences affect embryonic and larval development. We demonstrate that these studies are not common in comparison to the majority of incubation thermal experiments that do not employ controlled parental breeding designs. However, 52 out of 56 studies we reviewed reported maternal, paternal or family identity influenced offspring responses to temperature. In characterizing these studies, Salmoniformes were the most studied order (52%), wild broodfish were more commonly used (55%), aquaculture motivations were less evident (23%), and few studies investigated offspring performance or traits beyond endogenous yolk stages. Overall, we suggest it is beneficial to experimentally examine temperature with consideration to parent-progeny relationships. To broaden our current understanding of intergenerational temperature effects, we recommend an increased focus on wild populations, offspring physiological and performance measures, later offspring development stages, and expanding research in non-salmonid species.  2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."

Nine female migratory trout were each crossed with one migratory and one resident male and the offspring were raised in hatchery tanks until first feeding. The behavioural studies showed that fry that responded bold towards a novel object also accepted a novel food item earlier and responded more aggressively towards their own mirror image. Principal component analysis showed that this shyness-boldness syndrome (PC1) explained 34% of the behavioural variation. Offspring boldness was not affected by paternal migratory life history, but significant effects of the female parent suggested maternal and/or genetic effects. Deviations from this pattern (PC2), where some individuals behaved less aggressively and performed more approaches to food, explained an additional 17% of the variation in behaviour, and was significantly influenced by length and paternal migratory life history. Fry growth and survival in nature was not associated with boldness (PC1) or PC2, suggesting that alternative behavioural strategies can be successful in nature. However, female parent effects on variation in fry size persisted over the first growth period in the wild, suggesting that these effects may influence offspring fitness during early life when major selection occurs.  2011 Springer-Verlag."

Hepatic production of SHBG fluctuates throughout the life cycle and is influenced primarily by metabolic and hormonal factors. Genetic differences also contribute to interindividual variations in plasma SHBG levels. In addition to controlling the plasma distribution, metabolic clearance, and bioavailability of sex steroids, SHBG accumulates in the extravascular compartments of some tissues and in the cytoplasm of specific epithelial cells, where it exerts novel effects on androgen and estrogen action. In mammals, the gene-encoding SHBG is expressed primarily in the liver but also at low levels in other tissues, including the testis. In subprimate species, Shbg expression in Sertoli cells is under the control of follicle-stimulating hormone and produces the androgen-binding protein that influences androgen actions in the seminiferous tubules and epididymis. In humans, the SHBG gene is not expressed in Sertoli cells, but its expression in germ cells produces an SHBG isoform that accumulates in the acrosome. In fish, Shbg is produced by the liver but has a unique function in the gill as a portal for natural steroids and xenobiotics, including synthetic steroids. However, salmon have retained a second, poorly conserved Shbg gene that is expressed only in ovary, muscle, and gill and that likely exerts specialized functions in these tissues.

Since the B-egg is usually the first to hatch and the only one to produce a fledging chick, we hypothesize that differential yolk androgen deposition may be an adaptive strategy for females to affect brood reduction.  2011 The Royal Society."

This study investigated a potential regulation mechanism for differential accumulation of gonadal hormones in bird eggs. Across vertebrates, glucocorticoids can suppress reproduction by downregulating gonadal hormones. Using the chicken as a model species, we therefore tested whether elevated levels of plasma corticosterone in female birds influence the production of gonadal steroids by the ovarian follicles and thus the amount of reproductive hormones in the egg yolk. Adult laying hens of two different strains (ISA brown and white Leghorn) were implanted subcutaneously with corticosterone pellets that elevated plasma corticosterone concentrations over a period of nine days. Steroid hormones were subsequently quantified in plasma and yolk. Corticosterone-implanted hens of both strains had lower plasma progesterone and testosterone levels and their yolks contained less progesterone and testosterone. The treatment also reduced egg and yolk mass. Plasma estrogen concentrations decreased in white Leghorns only whereas in both strains yolk estrogens were unaffected. Our results demonstrate for the first time that maternal plasma corticosterone levels influence reproductive hormone concentrations in the yolk. Maternal corticosterone could therefore mediate environmentally induced changes in yolk gonadal hormone concentrations. In addition, stressful situations experienced by the bird mother might affect the offspring via reduced amounts of reproductive hormones present in the egg as well as available nutrients for the embryo.  2011 Henriksen et al."

To understand basic evolutionary processes in the hormonal regulation of reproductivetraits, we need to know whether, and during which reproductive phases, individual variation in hormoneconcentrations relates to fitness in natural populations. We related circulating concentrations of prolactinand corticosterone to parental behaviour and reproductive success during both the pre-breeding and thechick-rearing stages in both individuals of pairs of free-living house sparrows, Passer domesticus. Prolactinand baseline corticosterone concentrations in pre-breeding females, and prolactin concentrations in prebreedingmales, predicted total number of fledglings. When the strong effect of lay date on total fledglingnumber was corrected for, only pre-breeding baseline corticosterone, but not prolactin, was negativelycorrelated with the reproductive success of females. During the breeding season, nestling provisioningrates of both sexes were negatively correlated with stress-induced corticosterone levels. Lastly, individualsof both sexes with low baseline corticosterone before and high baseline corticosterone during breedingraised the most offspring, suggesting that either the plasticity of this trait contributes to reproductivesuccess or that high parental effort leads to increased hormone concentrations. Thus hormone concentrationsboth before and during breeding, as well as their seasonal dynamics, predict reproductivesuccess, suggesting that individual variation in absolute concentrations and in plasticity is functionallysignificant, and, if heritable, may be a target of selection.  2011 The Royal Society."

Methods: We challenged the immune systems of females, before egg laying, with a novel antigen (Newcastle Disease virus vaccine, NDV). We also removed eggs as they were laid, so as to induce supernormal egg production. Conclusion: Compared with the other eggs, the last-laid eggs of hens with supernormal production were smaller, contained less yolk, had a lighter shell, and contained albumen with less lysozyme. However, the immune challenge had no effect on female condition or egg quality. Thus we found no evidence of a trade-off between immune function, body condition, and reproductive allocation.  2011 Marco Cucco."

We investigated the responsiveness to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in female canaries whose embryonic exposure to yolk testosterone had been manipulated. This enabled us to study to what extent GnRH interlinks testosterone concentrations in female circulation and egg yolk as well as the intergenerational potential of hormone-mediated maternal effects. As expected, canary females responded to GnRH with a rise in plasma testosterone. The GnRH-responsiveness was positively correlated with the yolk testosterone content. Factors stimulating the release of GnRH will, therefore, lead to an increase of testosterone in both plasma and egg, posing a potential constraint on the yolk hormone deposition due to testosterone related trade-offs within the laying female. Exposure to elevated yolk testosterone levels as embryo reduced the GnRH-responsiveness in adulthood, potentially limiting environmental influences on yolk testosterone deposition, but the concentrations of yolk testosterone itself were not affected.  2011 Mller et al."

Predation risk is known to influence behaviour and development, especially in breeding animals. Mothers may be selected to transfer information about the intensity of such risk to their offspring through maternal effects and thus influence their development. 2. Here, we test for this maternal effect via manipulation of perceived predation risk by exposing great tit females before and during ovulation to stuffed models and sounds of either a predator bird (sparrowhawk -Accipiter nisus) or of a non-predatory control (song thrush -Turdus philomelos) in their environment. Offspring of exposed mothers were then raised by foster parents subjected to no treatment in order to separate maternal effects from effects during post-hatching parental care. 3. Nestlings of mothers under increased predator density were smaller than those of control mothers yet showed higher growth rates of the wings. Additionally, first-year recruits from the predator treatment had longer wings at maturity. 4. This maternal effect may be a passive consequence of higher circulating stress hormone levels in mothers. The accelerated wing growth during the nestling stage may be a result of compensatory growth. 5. Alternatively, the accelerated wing growth, coupled with the longer wings at maturity, suggest that the maternal response to the environmental risk may be adaptive since lower weight and bigger wings are a selective advantage for predator evasion. In this case the maternal effect probably influences the distribution of resources to different growth functions in offspring. 6. We show for the first time through an environmental rather than a direct hormonal manipulation, that predation risk may elicit adaptive maternal effects in birds.  2011 The Authors.

Despite many case studies on each of these topics, this knowledge has not been rigorously integrated into individual parental care traits for any taxon. Consequently, we lack a comprehensive, quantitative assessment of how parental care modifies offspring phenotypes. This meta-analysis of 283 studies with 1805 correlations between egg size and offspring quality in birds is intended to fill this gap. The large sample size enabled testing of how the magnitude of the relationship between egg size and offspring quality depends on a number of variables. Egg size was positively related to nearly all studied offspring traits across all stages of the offspring life cycle. Not surprisingly, the relationship was strongest at hatching but persisted until the post-fledging stage. Morphological traits were the most closely related to egg size but significant relationships were also found with hatching success, chick survival, and growth rate. Non-significant effect sizes were found for egg fertility, chick immunity, behaviour, and life-history or sexual traits. Effect size did not depend on whether chicks were raised by their natural parents or were cross-fostered to other territories. Effect size did not depend on species-specific traits such as developmental mode, clutch size, and relative size of the egg, but was larger if tested in captive compared to wild populations and between rather than within broods. In sum, published studies support the view that egg size affects juvenile survival. There are very few studies that tested the relationship between egg size and the fecundity component of offspring fitness, and no studies on offspring survival as adults or on global fitness. More data are also needed for the relationships between egg size and offspring behavioural and physiological traits. It remains to be established whether the relationship between egg size and offspring performance depends on the quality of the offspring environment. Positive effect sizes found in this study are likely to be driven by a causal effect of egg size on offspring quality. However, more studies that control for potential confounding effects of parental post-hatching care, genes, and egg composition are needed to establish firmly this causal link.  2010 The Author.

Additionally, there is some, though limited, evidence that similar early exposure can also negatively impact cognitive ability. Following pioneering mammalian studies, several avian studies have revealed that the responsiveness of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis as an adult can be explained by levels of corticosterone, the avian glucocorticoid, the individual experienced as a nestling or even as an embryo via yolk exposure. Studies also suggest that perinatal exposure to corticosterone can have effects upon avian 'personalities' or coping styles, and findings from mammalian studies suggest that these long-term effects are mediated epigenetically via altered expression of relevant DNA sequences. Although a consistent pattern across-species has yet to emerge, recent work in Florida scrub-jays Aphelocoma coerulescens found that baseline corticosterone levels in 11-day-old nestlings explained 84% of the variation in 'personality' (bold vs. timid) when those individuals were tested approximately seven months later. Nestlings with elevated corticosterone levels were more timid than those individuals that as nestlings experienced relatively low corticosterone levels. Some researchers have suggested that parents might use such mechanisms to 'program' their offsprings' phenotype to best fit prevailing environmental conditions. This review will visit what is known about the links between stressful developmental conditions that result in exposure to elevated corticosterone and the short- and long-term effects of this steroid hormone upon central nervous system function and whether alterations thereof are beneficial, deleterious, or neutral. It will concentrate on examples from birds, although critical supporting studies from the mammalian literature will be included as appropriate. sschoech@memphis.edu."

Experiments on a variety of species in which in ovo levels of testosterone have been experimentally increased have produced mixed results; some have found increased growth and suppressed immune function of nestlings whereas others have found the opposite. In an attempt to clarify the relationship between in ovotestosterone and nestling size, mass, health state and immune responsiveness, we experimentally increased levels of testosterone in the eggs of house wrens (Troglodytes aedon). We simultaneously determined the size, mass, hematocrit (a measure of health state), cutaneous immune response to phytohaemagglutinin and plasma bactericidal activity of nestlings near the time of fledging. We predicted that nestlings hatching from testosterone-injected eggs would exhibit lower immune responsiveness, but achieve greater mass, size and condition, than nestlings hatching from vehicle-injected control eggs. Instead, we found that nestlings hatching from testosterone-injected eggs had a weaker cutaneous immune response but greater bactericidal activity than those hatching from control eggs. They did not, however, differ significantly in mass, size or hematocrit from controls. These results suggest that experimentally increased in ovo testosterone induced a trade-off between bactericidal activity and the cutaneous immune response. The opposite responses by two different measures of immune function to experimentally increased in ovo testosterone underscore the importance of including multiple immune assays when investigating the potential for trade-offs with the immune system and other physiological functions.  2011.

This phenomenon is evolutionary conserved among several vertebrate species and has relevance to the etiology of psychiatric disorders. Why do we need novel animal models? Although significant progress has been achieved with the use of traditional mammalian models, there are major pitfalls associated with their use that impedes progress on two major fronts: 1) uncovering of the molecular mechanisms underlying aspects of compromised (stress-exposed) brain development relevant to the etiology of psychiatric disorders, and 2) ability to develop high-throughput technology for drug discovery in the field of psychiatry. The zebrafish model helps resolve these issues.Here we present a conceptual framework for the use of zebrafish in stress research and psychiatry by addressing three specific domains of application: 1) stress research, 2) human disease mechanisms, and 3) drug discovery.

In placental amniotes, the dynamic interaction of maternal and embryonic steroid production and metabolism is critical to regulating the endocrine environment. Less is known about how embryos of oviparous amniotes regulate their endocrine environment because most studies have focused on relating initial steroid levels in the yolk at oviposition to offspring phenotype. We tested the hypothesis that embryos of oviparous amniotes regulate their endocrine environment by conjugating maternal steroids and subsequently using the metabolites as precursors for steroid production later in development. Using the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta), we first characterized the conjugation of exogenous oestradiol to either oestradiol glucuronide or oestradiol sulphate (E2-S) in ovo during the first 15 days of development. Results show that oestradiol is primarily conjugated to E2-S. We then examined whether E2-S influenced sex determination and report that E2-S increases the production of female offspring. These data demonstrate that oviparous amniotes can both sulphonate steroids and respond to sulphonated steroids during embryonic development in a manner similar to placental amniotes.  2010 The Royal Society."

Ran GTPase has an essential role in relaying the active role of chromosomes in their own segregation by the meiotic process. In addition to its conserved role as a key regulator of macromolecular transport between nucleus and cytoplasm, Ran has important functions during cell division, including in mitotic spindle assembly and in the assembly of nuclear envelope at the exit from mitosis. The cellular functions of Ran are mediated by RanGTP interactions with nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) related to importin  and depend on the existence of chromosome-centered RanGTP gradient. Live imaging with FRET biosensors indeed revealed the existence of RanGTP gradient throughout mouse oocyte maturation. NTR-dependent transport of cell cycle regulators including cyclin B1, Wee2, and Cdc25B between the oocyte cytoplasm and germinal vesicle (GV) is required for normal resumption of meiosis. After GVBD in mouse oocytes, RanGTP gradient is required for timely meiosis I (MI) spindle assembly and provides long-range signal directing egg cortex differentiation. However, RanGTP gradient is not required for MI spindle migration and may be dispensable for MI spindle function in chromosome segregation. In contrast, MII spindle assembly and function in maturing mouse and Xenopus laevis eggs depend on RanGTP gradient, similar to X. laevis MII-derived egg extracts.  2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Here, we develop a model of maternal effects on offspring dispersal phenotype under parent-offspring conflict to evaluate such dependence. In the absence of evolutionary constraints and costs, offspring evolve dispersal rates from different patch types that reflect their own, rather than the maternal, optima. This result also holds true when offspring are unable to assess their own environment because the maternal phenotype provides an additional source of information. Consequently, maternal effects on offspring diapause, dispersal, and other traits that do not necessarily represent costly resource investment are more likely to maximize offspring than maternal fitness. However, when trait expression was costly, the evolutionarily stable dispersal rates tended to deviate from those under both maternal and offspring control.

One mechanism for achieving this is the modification of competitive asymmetries between siblings by maternal hormones. In many organisms, offspring value varies according to birth position in the brood, which determines survival chances and competitive advantage over access to resources. In birds, variation in yolk androgen allocation over the laying sequence is thought to modulate dominance of senior chicks over junior brood mates. We tested this hypothesis in zebra finches, which show a naturally decreasing pattern of within-clutch testosterone allocation. We abolished these within-clutch differences by experimentally elevating yolk testosterone levels in eggs 2-6 to the level of egg 1, and we assessed fitness measures for junior offspring (eggs 2-6), senior offspring (egg 1), and their mothers. Testosterone-injected eggs hatched later than control eggs. Junior, but not senior, chicks in testosterone-treated broods attained poorer phenotypic quality compared to control broods, which was not compensated for by positive effects on seniors. Mothers were generally unaffected by clutch treatment. Thus, naturally decreasing within-clutch yolk testosterone allocation appears to benefit all family members and does not generally enhance brood reduction by favoring senior chicks, in contrast to the widely held assumption.  2011 by The University of Chicago."

In avian systems, parents tightly control these environments through provisioning of nutrients to the egg and through incubation. Parents can influence embryonic development through egg size, eggshell conductance, hormones, or other substances deposited in eggs and through the onset and temperature of incubation. In addition to these parental influences, evidence suggests that avian embryos are able to perceive and actively respond to their environment during incubation and adjust their own development. Evolution of embryos' responses to developmental environments in birds can be understood in the context of parent-offspring conflicts. When parental investments favor future reproduction over current reproduction, current offspring pay fitness costs, which result in strong selection for offspring that can respond to developmental environments independent of their parents. Here, we review literature indicating that avian embryos actively respond to maternally derived components of the egg, vocalizations, and differences in day length, and we explore these responses in the context of three situations where the consequence of these environments to the fitnesses of offspring and parents differ: the degree of synchrony in hatching, the deposition of hormones in yolks, and seasonal timing of breeding.

To better understand the functional significance of intra-specific variation in egg size as a determinant of offspring fitness within a life-history (sex-specific life-history strategies) and an environmental (poor rearing conditions) context, we experimentally increased developmental stress (via maternal feather-clipping) in the sexually size-dimorphic European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) and measured phenotypic traits in offspring across multiple biological scales. As predicted by life-history theory, sons and daughters had different responses when faced with developmental stress and variation in egg size. In response to developmental stress, small egg size in normally faster-growing sons was associated with catch-up growth prior to attaining larger adult size, resulting in a reduction in developmental stability. Daughters apparently avoided this developmental instability by reducing growth rate and eventual adult body mass and size. Interestingly, large egg size provided offspring with greater developmental flexibility under poor growth conditions. Large-egg sons and daughters avoided the reduction in developmental stability, and daughters also showed enhanced escape performance during flight trials. Furthermore, large egg size resulted in elevated immune responses for both sexes under developmental stress. These findings show that there can be significant, but complex, context-specific effects of egg size on offspring phenotype at least up to fledging, but these can only be demonstrated by appreciating variation in the quality of the offspring environment and life histories. Results are therefore consistent with egg size playing a significant role in shaping the phenotypic outcome of offspring in species that show even greater intra-specific variation in egg size than starlings.  2011 The Authors.

However, it remains poorly understood how these skews are achieved. Female condition, and consequent variation in circulating hormones, provides a plausible mechanistic link between offspring sex biases and the environmental and social stresses commonly invoked to explain adaptive sex allocation, such as diet, territory quality, and body condition. However, although experimental studies have shown that female perception of male phenotype alone can lead to sex ratio biases, it is unknown how partner quality influences female physiological state. Using a controlled within-female experimental design where female Gouldian finches (Erythrura gouldiae) bred with both high-and low-quality males, we found that partner quality directly affects female hormonal status and subsequent fitness. When constrained to breeding with low-quality males, females had highly elevated stress responses (corticosterone levels) and produced adaptive male-biased sex ratios, whereas when they bred with high-quality males, females had low corticosterone levels and produced an equal offspring sex ratio. There was no effect of other maternal hormones (e.g., testosterone) or body condition on offspring sex ratios. Female physiological condition during egg production, and variation in circulating hormones in particular, may provide a general mechanistic route for strategic sex allocation in birds.  2011 The Author."

We decomposed the complex begging display of yellow-legged gull, Larus michahellis, chicks into two different functional components: begging for food (pecks) and drawing the attention of parents (chatter calls). We examined these begging components in 2-day-old chicks that hatched and grew up in foster nests, by performing a begging test for each chick alone without the hindrance of its foster siblings. Male chicks and those with poorer body condition begged for food at higher rates than females and those with better body condition, respectively. Chicks from larger broods begged for food more frequently, but chicks from male-biased broods begged less frequently. If begging is costly, chicks may adjust their begging efforts to the intensity of sibling competition. Frequency of chatter calls varied with sex, chick order within broods and body condition: females, the third chicks and those with poorer condition produced chatter calls more frequently. Genetic origin had a significant effect on frequency of chatter calls but not on begging for food, while foster nest effect was null in both traits. Therefore, chatter calls (but not pecks) can be subject to evolution under directional selection.

However, only acute molecular manipulations are possible in vitro. Here, using selective pharmacological manipulations of sea urchin eggs ex vivo, we test the hypothesis that specific lipidic components of the membrane matrix selectively affect defined late stages of exocytosis, particularly the Ca2+-triggered steps of fast membrane fusion. Egg treatments with cholesterol-lowering drugs resulted in the inhibition of vesicle fusion. Exogenous cholesterol recovered fusion extent and efficiency in cholesterol-depleted membranes; -tocopherol, a structurally dissimilar curvature analogue, selectively restored fusion extent. Inhibition of phospholipase C reduced vesicle phosphatidylethanolamine and suppressed both the extent and kinetics of fusion. Although phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibition altered levels of polyphosphoinositide species and reduced all fusion parameters, sequestering polyphosphoinositides selectively inhibited fusion kinetics. Thus, cholesterol and phosphatidylethanolamine play direct roles in the fusion pathway, contributing negative curvature. Cholesterol also organizes the physiological fusion site, defining fusion efficiency. A selective influence of phosphatidylethanolamine on fusion kinetics sheds light on the local microdomain structure at the site of docking/fusion. Polyphosphoinositides have modulatory upstream roles in priming: alterations in specific polyphosphoinositides likely represent the terminal priming steps defining fully docked, release-ready vesicles. Thus, this pharmacological approach has the potential to be a robust high-throughput platform to identify molecular components of the physiological fusion machine critical to docking, priming, and triggered fusion.  2011 Springer-Verlag."

They have been used most widely in mammals, and mammalian studies have also treated issues such as sample stability and storage methods. In birds, faecal corticosterone metabolite (CM) assays have been validated for a small number of species, and adequate storage under field conditions has not been addressed explicitly in previous studies. Furthermore, while it is well-established that baseline plasma corticosterone levels in birds rise with declining body condition, no study so far investigated if this relationship is also reflected in faecal samples. We here present data of a field study in wild Upland geese Chloephaga picta leucoptera on the Falkland Islands, testing different storage methods and investigating the relationship of faecal CM concentrations to body condition and reproductive parameters. We found that faecal CM measures are significantly repeatable within individuals, higher in individuals with lower body condition in both male and female wild Upland geese and higher in later breeding females with smaller broods. These results suggest that measuring faecal CM values may be a valuable non-invasive tool to monitor the relative condition or health of individuals and populations, especially in areas where there still is intense hunting practice.  2011 The Author(s)."

Although the physiological basis and direct costs of aggression are generally well known, less is known about the physiological costs such as increased oxidative stress (OS). This can occur via increased leakage of oxidants during high metabolic demands such as physical activity, or by hormones regulating both metabolism and aggression. Here we address this within a natural population of White's skinks, Egernia whitii; a species in which both sexes exhibit consistent aggressive phenotypes, and sex-specific associations between testosterone and aggression. The results reveal that males' aggressive phenotype, independent of testosterone, was positively associated with antioxidant capacity (OXY), while there was no significant association in females. Oxidative damage (ROM) and oxidative stress index (OI), were not influenced by aggressive phenotype or testosterone, but showed borderline positive associations with body size (i.e., age). The results failed to show that high testosterone increases OS. Instead, OS may be related to sex-specific behavioural patterns associated with aggressive phenotype such as territory and mate acquisition. Although experimental work is needed to identify the causal links for these patterns, the results highlight the need to consider proximate mechanisms to understand constraints on phenotypic variation.  2011 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden."

Maternal hormone transfer varies with environmental conditions of the mother and is often interpreted as being shaped by natural selection to adjust the offspring to prevailing environmental conditions. Such hormone transfer requires genetic variability, which has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. Our study reports direct evidence for additive genetic variance of maternal androgens through a bidirectional selection on yolk testosterone (T) levels in Japanese quail. Lines selected for high egg T (HET) and low egg T (LET) concentration differed in yolk levels of this androgen, resulting in high realized heritability (h2p 0.42). Correlated responses to selection on other gonadal hormones indicated that selection specifically targeted biologically active androgens. Eggs of HET quail contained higher androstenedione and lower estradiol concentrations than did those of LET quail, with no line differences in yolk progesterone concentration. Plasma T concentrations in adult females were not affected by selection, seriously challenging the hypothesis that transfer of maternal hormones to offspring is constrained by hormone levels in a mother's circulation. Our results suggest that transfer of maternal T represents an indirect genetic effect that has important consequences for the evolution of traits in offspring.  2011 by The University of Chicago."

We critically review prenatal corticosterone mediated effects in birds by reviewing both studies were females had elevated levels of plasma corticosterone during egg formation and studies applying corticosterone injections directly into the egg. A selected review of the mammalian literature is used as background. The results suggest that besides prenatal exposure to corticosterone itself, maternal corticosterone affects offspring's behaviour and physiology via alteration of other egg components.

In southern European populations of pied flycatchers, a sexually selected male ornament is also expressed by a proportion of females. Additive genetic variances in ornament size and expression, transmission mechanisms (autosomal vs Z-linkage) and maternal effects are examined by looking at patterns of familial resemblance across three generations. Size of the secondary sex trait has a genetic basis common to both sexes, with estimated heritability being 0.5 under an autosomal model of inheritance. Significant additive genetic variance in males was also confirmed through a cross-fostering experiment. Heritability analyses were only partially consistent with previous molecular genetics evidence, as only two out of the three predictions supported Z-linkage and lack of significant mother-daughter resemblance could be due to small sample sizes caused by limited female trait expression. Therefore, the evidence was mixed as to the contribution of the Z chromosome and autosomal genes to trait size. The threshold heritability of trait expression in females was lower, around 0.3, supporting autosomal-based trait expression in females. Environmental (birth date) and parental effects on ornament size mediated by the mother's condition after accounting for maternal and paternal genetic influences are also highlighted. The genetic correlation between the sexes did not differ from one, indicating that selection on the character on either sex entails a correlated response in the opposite sex.  2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved."

They enter the natural environment through multiple sources, and many non-target wildlife species are exposed to them via several modes. Exposure causes altered hormone levels, importantly gonadal hormones, resulting in changed reproductive characteristics. Vertebrate male mating signals convey important mate quality information to females. These signals are dependent on androgens for their production and maintenance. Female responses to signals depend on oestrogens. Disrupting these pathways jeopardizes signal production and reception, which has implications for mating system ecology. Besides affecting various aspects of the vertebrate physiology, EDCs can impair hormonal functioning by binding to or blocking hormone receptors, or by altering production and function of hormones or hormone receptors. We consider the ecological implications of multi-generational signal disruption by EDCs. Altered signals can influence population dynamics and sex ratios; local extinctions are possible. Community-level dynamics may be affected via interspecific dependence on signals or population fluctuations. We then address the evolutionary effects of EDC-altered male mating signals in vertebrates and discuss how females may respond to altered signals over evolutionary time. Trans-generational reduction in signal reliability can lead to reduced preference and eventual loss of the signal trait and to the evolution of new traits as signals of mate quality. Genetic divergence between endocrine disrupted and undisrupted populations may result, perhaps giving rise to speciation. Finally, we recommend areas of research to further explore some of the issues addressed in this review. We suggest field surveys to document existing alterations in mating systems and genetic divergence in endocrine disrupted populations. Long-term mesocosm studies and mathematical models would be useful to predict the fate of mating signals and female responses as a result of prolonged endocrine disruption. EDCs have been the focus of ecotoxicology for some time now, and we feel that this analysis should now enter the realm of evolutionary biology to determine the subtle, yet far-reaching effects on exposed non-target wildlife.  2010 The Authors.

Thus, females may be selected to advertise their yolk antioxidant deposition to discriminatory males via ornamental signals, perhaps depending on the reproductive costs associated with signal production. 2.Female striped plateau lizards (Sceloporus virgatus) develop pterin-based orange colour patches during the reproductive season that influence male behaviour and that are positively associated with the phenotypic quality of the female and her offspring. Here, we assessed one potential developmental mechanism underlying the relationship between offspring quality and female ornamentation in S. virgatus, by examining the relationship between ornament expression and yolk antioxidant levels. 3.As expected, concentrations of the yolk antioxidants vitamin A, vitamin E and carotenoids (lutein and zeaxanthin) were strongly positively intercorrelated. Eggs from larger clutches had fewer antioxidants than eggs from smaller clutches, suggesting that females may be limited in antioxidant availability or use. Fertilized and unfertilized eggs did not differ in yolk antioxidant levels. 4.The size of a female's ornament was positively related to both the concentration and total amount of yolk antioxidants, and ornament colour was positively related to yolk antioxidant concentration. Thus, in S. virgatus, female ornaments may advertise egg quality. In addition, these data suggest that more ornamented females may produce higher-quality offspring, in part because their eggs contain more antioxidants. As the colour ornament of interest is derived from pterins, not carotenoids, direct resource trade-offs between ornaments and eggs may be eliminated, reducing reproductive costs associated with signalling. 5.This is the first example of a positive relationship between female ornamentation and yolk antioxidants in reptiles and may indicate the general importance of these patterns in oviparous vertebrates.  2011 The Authors.

Digit ratios have been highlighted as a potential easy-to-measure indicator of early steroid exposure, as they have been suggested to reflect steroid, mainly testosterone levels during prenatal development. However, evidence for digit ratios reflecting early steroid levels is weak, as experimental studies, especially in wild populations, are scarce. We studied the association between maternally derived yolk androgens and digit ratios (2D:4D, 2D:3D and 3D:4D) using both correlative data and a rather high level of experimental elevation of yolk androgens in a passerine bird, the pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca). We also examined whether digit ratios have indicator value in an evolutionary context by studying correlations between digit ratios and reproductive traits, secondary sexual traits and exploratory behaviour. We did not find any association between digit ratios and yolk androgen level either in correlative or experimental data. Digit ratios were neither related to any of the reproductive and secondary sexual traits or exploratory behaviour measured. There was, however, a sex difference in 2D:3D and 3D:4D of adult birds (due to second and fourth digits being shorter in females), which was not apparent in fledglings or captivity-raised juveniles. This suggests that either the sex difference may develop as late as during the sexual maturation for breeding. These results indicate that, in this species, digit ratios are not reliable markers of maternally derived yolk androgen exposure and that they bear little relevance as correlates of the adaptive traits we measured.  2010 The Author(s)."

Zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata, in particular, adjust offspring sex ratio according to both the quality and quantity of available food, as well as male attractiveness. The mechanisms behind such manipulation of offspring sex remain elusive. Recent studies suggest that females with chronically elevated corticosterone levels (both naturally and artificially) produce significantly female biased offspring sex ratios. We tested the effects of a pharmacological dose of corticosterone or progesterone administered at the time of sex chromosome segregation on the primary sex ratio of zebra finch offspring to determine whether one or both hormones act on offspring sex at this critical period. Females were injected with 20 g of corticosterone or 20 g of progesterone five hours prior to the predicted time of ovulation of the 3rd or 4th ovulating follicle. A third group of females were unmanipulated. The corticosterone treated group produced 72% males while the control group produced 37.5% in the 3rd or 4th ovulation of the sequence. Progesterone injections disrupted ovulation and oviposition in 90% of females. Corticosterone administration did not adversely affect oviposition or ovulation. Females injected with corticosterone had significantly elevated levels of corticosterone 20 min, 1 h and 2.5 h post-injection and produced significantly more males compared to untreated females. Our results suggest that offspring sex ratios may be influenced at the time of meiotic division by acute exposure to corticosterone and provides evidence for the timing of this effect.  2011 The Authors."

In altricial songbirds, one influence on the fitness prospects of offspring arises through the order in which nestlings hatch from their eggs, which affects individual mass and size before nest leaving. In house wrens (Troglodytes aedon), the influence of hatching order depends on the degree of hatching synchrony, with greater variation in nestling mass and size within broods hatching asynchronously than in those hatching synchronously. Early-hatching nestlings in asynchronous broods were heavier and larger than their later-hatching siblings and nestlings in synchronous broods. The effect of hatching order was also sex specific, as the mass of males in asynchronous broods was more strongly influenced by hatching order than the mass of females, with increased variation in the mass of males relative to that of females. As predicted, mothers hatching their eggs asynchronously biased first-laid, first hatching eggs toward sons and late-laid, late-hatching eggs toward daughters, whereas females hatching their eggs synchronously distributed the sexes randomly among the eggs of their clutch. We conclude that females allocate the sex of their offspring among the eggs of their clutch in a manner that maximizes their own fitness.  2011 by The University of Chicago."

Consistent individual differences in these behaviours (personality traits) are often correlated and known to be under natural selection. These differences are frequently associated with variation in physiological traits, such as endocrine profiles. For example, variation in circulating testosterone levels is associated with variation in several personality traits and has been hypothesized to be a marker for personality in humans and rodents. The importance of testosterone in controlling both behavioural strategies and individual physiological differences suggests that direct selection on personality traits might cause pleiotropic selection on the physiological mechanisms underlying these traits. To test this hypothesis, we quantified levels of plasma testosterone levels and measured phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-induced immune responses of male great tits, Parus major, in lines artificially selected for diverging levels of avian personality ('fast' and 'slow' exploratory behaviour). We found that testosterone levels were highly repeatable within individuals and fluctuated predictably over the season. Contrary to our expectations, 'slow' explorers had consistently higher levels of baseline testosterone and higher immune responses than 'fast' explorers. These results show that phenotypic selection for variation in personality traits corresponds to consistent differences in hormone profile and immune function, but that higher aggression levels do not need to be associated with higher baseline testosterone levels. Our results confirm that personality traits have evolved as a result of selection on both the underlying controlling physiological mechanisms and the phenotypic traits.  2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

To explore this possibility, we determined albumen 13C and 15N values in three-egg clutches (modal clutch size) from three different breeding episodes: Ebro Delta 2004 and 2006, and Columbretes Islands 2004. Rather than a shift in females' diet, consistent intra-clutch patterns of variation in egg size and albumen isotopic values (particularly in the case of albumen 13C, which values held constant throughout the laying sequence) pointed to an intrinsic mechanism as the most feasible cause for the relatively smaller size of third/last-laid eggs. However, diet ""quality"" for breeding females seemed to affect intra-clutch egg size variation. In particular, a deficit of specific nutrients for egg formation associated to refuse scraps exploitation (as suggested by depleted albumen isotopic values) likely resulted in the more apparent intra-clutch egg size profile for the Ebro Delta 2004. In the absence of dietary shifts, the observation of consistently higher 15N values for third-albumens suggested a greater contribution of endogenous resources to their synthesis, as conversion of stored reserves into egg proteins results in greater isotopic fractionation, thereby yielding enriched isotopic signatures (particularly for 15N that shows greater isotopic fractionation with respect to that commonly assumed for 13C). We point to reabsorbed material derived from the hormonally-mediated regression of the female reproductive system (which is likely the intrinsic mechanisms resulting in the intra-clutch pattern of egg size variation: the hormonal hypothesis) as the most feasible endogenous source of nutrients for the synthesis of last-laid eggs, as optimize reproductive investment and maximize female fitness.  2011 The Authors."

Male Japanese quail follow a typical sequence of copulatory behaviors during a mating interaction and often force copulations with unreceptive females. We hypothesized that female Japanese quail could adjust maternal investment in response to male copulatory behaviors during a single mating interaction. We investigated the relationships between 1) male copulatory behaviors and post-mating concentrations of steroids in the female, 2) female steroid concentrations and fertilization success of inseminations and 3) female steroid concentrations and the offspring sex ratio. We found that male condition and copulatory behaviors predicted female steroid concentrations and maternal investment in eggs laid after a mating trial. The body condition of one or both mates was a significant predictor of the changes in female corticosterone and testosterone concentrations after mating, whereas specific male copulatory behaviors significantly predicted changes in female progesterone concentrations. Male and female body condition, male neck grabs and post-mating concentrations of female corticosterone, progesterone, and testosterone were all significant predictors of egg fertilization rates. Female body condition, male copulation efficiency, and female testosterone concentrations were significant predictors of offspring sex ratios.

It has since been shown that TSD occurs in some fish, several lizards, tuataras, numerous turtles and all crocodilians. Extreme temperatures can also cause sex reversal in several amphibians and lizards with genotypic sex determination. Research in TSD species indicates that estrogen signaling is important for ovary development and that orthologs of mammalian genes have a function in gonad differentiation. Nevertheless, the mechanism that actually transduces temperature into a biological signal for ovary versus testis development is not known in any species. Classical genetics could be used to identify the loci underlying TSD, but only if there is segregating variation for TSD. Here, we use the animal model to analyze inheritance of sexual phenotype in a 13-generation pedigree of captive leopard geckos, Eublepharis macularius, a TSD reptile. We directly show genetic variance and genotype-by-temperature interactions for sex determination. Additive genetic variation was significant at a temperature that produces a female-biased sex ratio (30 C), but not at a temperature that produces a male-biased sex ratio (32.5 C). Conversely, dominance variance was significant at the male-biased temperature (32.5 C), but not at the female-biased temperature (30 C). Non-genetic maternal effects on sex determination were negligible in comparison with additive genetic variance, dominance variance and the primary effect of temperature. These data show for the first time that there is segregating variation for TSD in a reptile and consequently that a quantitative trait locus analysis would be practicable for identifying the genes underlying TSD.  2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved."

In organisms with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), targets of sex-ratio selection include the thermal sensitivity of the sex-determining pathway (hereafter, sex determination threshold) and nest-site choice. However, offspring sex may be canalized for nests located in thermally extreme environments; thus, genetic variance for the sex determination threshold is not expressed and is invisible to direct selection. The concept of 'effective heritability' accounts for this dependence and provides a more realistic prediction of the expected evolutionary response to selection in the wild. Past estimates of effective heritability of the sex determination threshold, which were derived from laboratory data, suggested that the potential for the sex determination threshold to evolve in the wild was extremely low. We re-evaluated original estimates of this parameter by analysing field-collected measures of nest temperatures, vegetation cover and clutch sex ratios from nests in a population of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta). We coupled these data with measurements of broad-sense heritability of the sex determination threshold in C. picta, using an experiment that splits clutches of eggs between a constant temperature (i.e. typical laboratory incubation) and a daily fluctuating temperature (i.e. similar to natural nests) with the same mean. We found that (i) the effective heritability of the sex determination threshold appears to have been historically underestimated and the effective heritability of nest-site choice has been overestimated and (ii) significant family-by-incubation treatment interaction exists for sex for C. picta between constant- and fluctuating-temperature regimes. Our results suggest that the thermal sensitivity of the sex-determining pathway may play a larger, more complex role in the microevolution of TSD than traditionally thought.  2011 The Authors.

Individual variation in circulating levels of testosterone (T) is often hypothesized to underpin personality traits such as aggressiveness and exploratory behaviour. Here we provide a comprehensive test of this hypothesis. We quantified variation in exploratory behaviour of a novel environment in a captive population of wild-caught male house sparrows, Passer domesticus. We then investigated the relationship between the observed behaviours and circulating levels of T, using two approaches. First, we tested whether measures of exploratory behaviour correlated with (1) point-sampled plasma T levels and (2) T-dependent ornamentation (bill coloration) in 114 males. Neither direct nor indirect estimates of individual variation in T levels were correlated with the assayed behaviours. Second, we experimentally increased plasma T levels of 21 males with T implants, using 21 placebo-implanted males as a control group. Experimentally induced between-individual variation in T levels did not increase the amount of between-individual variation in exploratory behaviour. Our results thus strongly suggest that, in house sparrows, between-individual variation in circulating levels of T cannot serve as a causal explanation for the existence of individual variation in exploratory behaviour.  2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

One prediction of this hypothesis is that females will increase reproductive investment when mated to high-quality males. In birds, it was shown that females can modulate pre-hatch reproductive investment by manipulating egg and clutch sizes and/or the concentrations of egg internal compounds according to paternal attractiveness. However, the differential allocation of immune factors has seldom been considered, particularly with an experimental approach. The carotenoid-based ornaments can function as reliable signals of quality, indicating better immunity or ability to resist parasites. Thus, numerous studies show that females use the expression of carotenoid-based colour when choosing mates; but the influence of this paternal coloration on maternal investment decisions has seldom been considered and has only been experimentally studied with artificial manipulation of male coloration. Here, we used dietary carotenoid provisioning to manipulate male mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) bill coloration, a sexually selected trait, and followed female investment. We show that an increase of male bill coloration positively influenced egg mass and albumen lysozyme concentration. By contrast, yolk carotenoid concentration was not affected by paternal ornamentation. Maternal decisions highlighted in this study may influence chick survival and compel males to maintain carotenoid-based coloration from the mate-choice period until egg-laying has been finished.  2010 The Royal Society."

Egg carotenoids may accomplish major roles in antioxidant protection or modulate physiological functions and growth, interfering with offspring redox status, potentially in a sex-dependent way. In this study of maternal effects in relation to sex and laying order of yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) chicks, we analyzed the consequences of increased yolk lutein concentration on plasma antioxidant capacity (AOC) and an index of early oxidative damage (reactive oxygen metabolites, ROM), till 9 days after hatching. To this end, for the first time we directly manipulated yolk lutein, thus avoiding any effect on other components of egg quality due to maternal supplementation before laying. Lutein did not increase AOC but increased ROM in males and in first-laid chicks. Hence, lutein did not act as an antioxidant and determined increased early oxidative damage, possibly because of upregulation of immune or other physiological functions, but these effects were sex-related and apparent in first-laid chicks with larger yolk lutein supply. ROM positively covaried with AOC, suggesting a trade-off between AOC and oxidative damage. Moreover, lutein injection altered the covariation between body size or immunity and AOC or ROM. Carotenoids may thus not be major antioxidants in birds and rather affect redox status by increasing oxidative damage in a sex-dependent way and interfere with the resolution of growth trade-offs. In the absence of sex-related allocation, maternal decisions on egg carotenoid concentration may depend on the balance between divergent effects on either sex.  2011 The Author."

Here, we review recent work in this field, and identify inconsistencies in the literature. We find good evidence that hormones play a role as regulators of begging: 13 studies report a positive effect on begging and six a negative effect. There is also good evidence that hormones influence offspring fitness, but the direction of reported effects is inconsistent: eight studies report a positive effect on offspring fitness and 10 a negative effect. We explore potential pathways linking hormonal effects on begging and growth. We find that our current understanding of these pathways is incomplete, and suggest a simple model linking hormonal effects on begging and growth. We next discuss the role of hormones as mediators of parent-offspring conflict. We find little evidence that maternal hormones provide a mechanism for parental favouritism. We use graphical models to explore the hypothesis that maternal hormones act as honest signals, and find that costs of hormone production can ensure the honesty of maternal hormones but only under very restricted conditions. We discuss evidence from recent cross-fostering experiments suggesting that maternal hormones act in the context of overlapping interests between parents and offspring. Finally, we highlight the need for more studies on nonavian taxa to establish whether hormonal regulation of begging is specific to birds or general across taxa where offspring beg for food from their parents.  2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

For instance, some bird species use their nests or display sites as nonbodily ornaments (extended phenotypes) in intersexual communication. Recently, it has been proposed that feather carrying constitutes a postmating sexual display. Here, evidence supporting this hypothesis is presented for a species in which such behavior had not been previously reported, the blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus. In our Mediterranean study populations, males carry feathers to the nest and place them outside the nest cup. Here, we show experimentally and by means of observational data that feather carrying by male blue tits induced their mates to increase their clutch size. In addition, males from ornamented nests fed their offspring at a higher rate than those from nests in which this behavior was not detected. Feather-carrying effort was positively associated with male tarsus length. On the other hand, females paired with males engaging in this activity reduced their feeding rates but obtained direct fitness benefits: Ornamented nests resulted in more fledged young with better body condition than those without feathers carried by males. In summary, this study suggests that male feather-carrying ability constitutes an honest signal of their parental quality and a good predictor of breeding success in these blue tit populations.  2011 The Author."

Interestingly, testosterone can also upregulate the bioavailability of certain antioxidants but simultaneously increases the susceptibility to oxidative stress in adulthood. However, little is known about the effects of maternally derived yolk testosterone on oxidative stress in developing birds. Here, we investigated the role of yolk testosterone on oxidative stress of yellow-legged gull chicks during their early development by experimentally increasing yolk testosterone levels. Levels of antioxidants, reactive oxygen species and lipid oxidative damage were determined in plasma during nestlings' growth. Our results revealed that, contrary to control chicks, birds hatched from testosterone-treated eggs did not show an increase in the levels of oxidative damage during postnatal development. Moreover, the same birds showed a transient increase in plasma antioxidant levels.

However, the validity of digit measures as a proxy of prenatal sex hormone exposure is controversial and only few studies have provided direct evidence for the link between digit development and prenatal sex hormones. Here, we report morph- and sex-specific variation in digit ratio in wild painted dragon lizards (Ctenophorus pictus). Lizards expressing a yellow bib have significantly larger third-to-fourth toe ratios (3D:4D) than lizards without a bib. Males have significantly smaller 3D:4D than females. Furthermore, we show that experimental elevation of yolk testosterone significantly increases 3D:4D in hatchling painted dragon lizards, but has no influence on hatchling size.

We studied maternal deposition of yolk androgens in eggs of southern rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome). Contrary to other avian models, laying and hatching sequences do not coincide in this species, which exhibits reversed hatching asynchrony. This provides a unique model to test whether the first egg to hatch (B-egg), which is the most likely to survive, differs in composition from the second egg to hatch (A-egg). We found that B-eggs had higher egg masses, yolk masses, yolk androgen concentrations and total yolk androgen amounts than A-eggs. This was observed consistently for the three androgens analyzed (testosterone, androstenedione and 5-dihydrotestosterone). Laying date affected androgen deposition into A- and B-eggs differently. Interestingly, late clutches had proportionally higher androgen levels in the B-egg compared to the A-egg than early clutches.

We experimentally studied whether female pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca could manipulate male investment via yolk androgens. There is much more variation in yolk androgen levels between females than within clutches, and in order to change the androgen levels of the eggs, we swapped whole clutches between nests. To estimate the androgen levels of the clutch, we measured the androgen content of a single egg per clutch. Females did not succeed in manipulating male effort using yolk androgens, since there was no relationship between the division of parental care within a pair and either original or foster egg androgen levels. One of these relationships should have occurred if females were manipulating males. The proportion of feeding visits by the male was higher when the male was old (55%) than when he was young (45%) and females laid eggs with higher androgen levels when mated with a young male. Young males did not exhibit any responses to yolk androgen levels either, which indicates that females cannot exploit their effort more than that of old males. We suggest that females may allocate yolk androgens to adjust the growth trajectories of the chicks to poor growing conditions when mated with young males that are poor providers or occupying a poor territory.  2010 Springer-Verlag."

In the chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), transgenerational transfer of egg yolk factors may set the stage for morphological and physiological phenotypic differences observed among breeds. To investigate the effect of breed-specific yolk composition on embryonic broiler and layer chicken phenotypes, we employed an ex ovo, xenobiotic technique that allowed the transfer of broiler and layer chicken embryos from their natural yolks to novel yolk environments. Embryonic day two broiler embryos developing on broiler yolk culture medium (YCM) had significantly higher heart rates than layer embryos developing on layer YCM (1767 beats min-1 and 1477beatsmin-1, respectively). Broiler embryos developing on layer YCM exhibited heart rates typical of layer embryos developing normally on layer YCM. However, layer embryo heart rates were not affected by development on broiler YCM. Unlike O2 consumption, development rate and body mass of embryos were significantly affected by exposure to different yolk types, with both broiler and layer embryos displaying traits that reflected yolk source rather than embryo genotype. Analysis of hormone concentrations of broiler and layer egg yolks revealed that testosterone concentrations were higher in broiler yolk (4.632.02 pg mg-1 vs 3.321.92 pgmg -1), whereas triiodothyronine concentrations were higher in layer yolk (1.050.18pgmg-1 vs 0.460.22 pgmg-1).

We hand-raised young from large and small eggs, and measured their initial body size and burst swimming speed. Thereafter we raised half of each egg-size class on high and half on low food ration and followed their growth trajectories and behavioural development until the age of 12weeks. 3.We found that larger eggs gave rise to larger young that had a higher burst swimming speed. Food ration greatly influenced long-term growth, while egg size predominantly affected fish size during the first 2weeks of life. However, large egg size caused a size advantage of juveniles persisting throughout the experimental period. 4.Egg size and food ration interactively affected the hiding and foraging behaviour of young. In the low-food treatment, individuals from small eggs spent less time in shelter and showed a higher commitment to foraging than individuals from large eggs. In a natural setting, this should markedly increase predation risk of young originating from small eggs, particularly in poor environments. In contrast, when food was plentiful juveniles behaved similarly, irrespective of egg size. 5.Our results show that egg size affects juvenile growth trajectories and behaviour differently in different environments. While it is well-established that a large egg size raises offspring fitness particularly in harsh environments, our study suggests that this advantage arises through risk-averse behaviour being tightly linked to offspring size.  2010 The Authors.

Yolk carotenoid composition is strongly affected by the carotenoid composition of the female's diet at the time of egg formation. Spatial and temporal differences in carotenoid availability may thus be reflected in yolk concentrations. To assess whether yolk carotenoid concentrations or carotenoid profiles show any large-scale geographical trends or differences among habitats, we collected yolk samples from 16 European populations of the pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca. We found that the concentrations and proportions of lutein and some other xanthophylls in the egg yolks decreased from Central Europe northwards. The most southern population (which is also the one found at the highest altitude) also showed relatively low carotenoid levels. Concentrations of -carotene and zeaxanthin did not show any obvious geographical gradients. Egg yolks also contained proportionally more lutein and other xanthophylls in deciduous than in mixed or coniferous habitats. We suggest that latitudinal gradients in lutein and xanthophylls reflect the lower availability of lutein-rich food items in the northern F. hypoleuca populations and in montane southern populations, which start egg-laying earlier relative to tree phenology than the Central European populations. Similarly, among-habitat variation is likely to reflect the better availability of lutein-rich food in deciduous forests.

Here, we examine patterns of egg yolk antioxidant deposition in an avian host (red-winged blackbird, Agelaius phoeniceus) and their brood parasite (brown-headed cowbird, Molothrus ater). Cowbird nestlings compete directly for food with host blackbird chicks and succeed, despite hatching from a smaller egg, by begging more intensely and growing as or more rapidly than their hosts. Dietary-derived antioxidants, such as carotenoids and vitamins E and A, deposited in egg yolk, may enhance growth rate and reduce oxidative stress, and therefore provide a potential mechanism by which female cowbirds could enhance the competitiveness of their young in host nests. However, provision of antioxidants to eggs is costly so we predicted that female cowbirds should adjust the amount of antioxidants in response to variation in host quality. We found that whilst red-winged blackbird clutches parasitised by cowbirds did not differ in the pattern of antioxidant deposition compared to non-parasitised clutches, levels of vitamin E deposited in cowbird eggs were closely matched to that of the individual host clutch in which cowbirds laid their egg. This supports the prediction that female cowbirds adjust the antioxidant concentration of their eggs to increase the likely competitiveness of their offspring in the host nest into which they are laid and may help explain the success of cowbirds in competing with larger host young.  2010 Springer-Verlag."

After depletion of a maternal deposit, de novo synthesis of cortisol increased exponentially between the 'eyed' stage and first feeding. Whole body CRF mRNA levels dominated over those of the related peptide urotensin I (UI) from hatch through complete yolk sac absorption. The mRNA levels of CRF-binding protein (CRF-BP) closely paralleled those of CRF and UI throughout ontogeny except at first feeding when an increase in CRF gene expression was not matched by change in CRF-BP transcript abundance. In the hypoxia challenge, fish were exposed to 15% O2 saturation for either 90min or 24h at three key developmental stages: hatch, swim up and first feeding. While the embryos were unaffected, chronic hypoxia elicited a transient 2-fold increase in whole-body cortisol levels in the larval stages.

Vertebrate and invertebrate animals rely primarily on three physiological systems for intra-organismal communication: the nervous, endocrine and immune systems. Rather than acting independently of one another, these systems communicate in an integrated fashion to coordinate suites of species-appropriate physiological and behavioural responses. 2.Our understanding of how these three systems are coordinated remains incomplete, in part because the importance of the immune system as part of this regulatory network has only recently been recognized. In contrast to the well-established integrative approach to the study of the endocrine and nervous systems, the study of immunity has traditionally occurred in relative isolation from other physiological systems. Immunity was typically considered to be largely buffered from environmental perturbations. 3.In the last several decades, however, this simplistic view has changed dramatically; we now know that a wide variety of extrinsic and intrinsic factors can affect immune responses (reviewed in: Ader, Felten & Cohen 2001). This altered perspective has led to the development of new scientific disciplines including psychoneuroimmunology (Ader & Cohen 1981) and ecological immunology (Sheldon & Verhulst 1996). 4.These new research fields focus on the connections among the endocrine, nervous and immune systems. These fields also examine how environmental factors influence interactions among the three systems, and the implications of these interactions for behaviour and host defence.

However, when interests of mother and offspring differ, parent-offspring conflict will arise and embryonic interests, not those of the mother, should drive offspring response to maternal steroids in eggs. Because of this potential conflict, we investigated the ability of developing bird embryos to process maternally derived yolk steroids. We examined how progesterone, testosterone and oestradiol levels changed in both the yolk/albumen (YA) and the embryo of European starling eggs during the first 10 days of development. Next, we injected tritiated testosterone into eggs at oviposition to characterize potential metabolic pathways during development. Ether extractions separated organic and aqueous metabolites in both the embryo and YA homogenate, after which major steroid metabolites were identified. Results indicate that the concentrations of all three steroids declined during development in the YA homogenate. Exogenous testosterone was primarily metabolized to an aqueous form of etiocholanolone that remained in the YA. These results clearly demonstrate that embryos can modulate their local steroid environment, setting up the potential for parent-offspring conflict. Embryonic regulation must be considered when addressing the evolutionary consequences of maternal steroids in eggs.  2010 The Royal Society."

However, owing to the prevalence of a short-term perspective, relevance of maternal transfer of sex steroids to sexual selection processes has been seldom studied.

Males from T-injected eggs obtained more copulations than control males, specifically with control females. The effect of male 'ordinary' and secondary sexual traits on either dominance or copulation frequency did not depend on early exposure to T, nor did T treatment affect male dominance.

Because sexually selected male traits should provide honest information about male genetic or phenotypic quality, females may invest more when paired with attractive males. However, there is substantial disagreement in the literature whether such differential allocation is a general pattern. Using a comparative meta-regression approach, we show that female birds generally invest more into reproduction when paired with attractive males, both in terms of egg size and number as well as food provisioning. However, whereas females of species with bi-parental care tend to primarily increase the number of eggs when paired with attractive males, females of species with female-only care produce larger, but not more, eggs. These patterns may reflect adaptive differences in female allocation strategies arising from variation in the signal content of sexually selected male traits between systems of parental care. In contrast to reproductive effort, female allocation of immune-stimulants, anti-oxidants and androgens to the egg yolk was not consistently increased when mated to attractive males, which probably reflects the context-dependent costs and benefits of those yolk compounds to females and offspring.  2011 The Royal Society."

Here, we experimentally test this in the bank vole (Myodes glareolus) by simultaneously manipulating the litter's size and sex ratio immediately after birth. Two weeks after manipulation, when mothers were at the peak of lactation and were pregnant with concurrent litters, we assessed their energy budget. We found that maternal food consumption and daily energy expenditure increased with the size of the litters being lactated.

These had consequences for the next generation, as size of female offspring from the concurrent pregnancy of these mothers was compromised.

Yolk concentration of androstenedione was much higher than that of testosterone. Offspring from eggs with relatively higher androstenedione concentrations within a clutch were relatively large after hatching, grew slower thereafter, and had a higher recruitment rate in subsequent years.

Here, we assessed individual food intake and body mass gain during feeding trials in barn swallow chicks differing for seniority and sex, and compared the intensity of their acoustic and postural solicitation (begging) displays.

Junior chicks begged more than seniors, independently of satiation level (which was also experimentally manipulated), and obtained greater access to food. Females were generally weaker competitors than males. Individual sex and sex of the opponent also affected duration of begging bouts. Present results thus show that competition with siblings can make the rearing environment variably harsh for developing chicks, depending on individual sex, sex of competing broodmates and age ranking within the nest. They also suggest that parental decisions on the allocation of care and response of kin to signalling siblings may further contribute to the outcome of sibling competition.  2010 The Royal Society."

Moreover, females with on average larger eggs before fertilization produce a more female-biased sex ratio afterwards. Egg size thus mediates sex-specific egg provisioning, sex and offspring sex ratio. Finally, sex-specific egg provisioning has another major consequence: male eggs produced by mated mothers are smaller than male eggs produced by virgins, and this size difference persists in adults.

We used nestbox cameras to monitor parental visit rate and the distribution of food among the nestlings in domestic, captive wild and wild free-living zebra finches. The percentage of nest visits by parents in which they fed the nestlings was consistent, with multiple feeds to different nestlings occurring within a single visit. The quantity of food delivered and its distribution among the nestlings, however, varied greatly both within and between broods. The number of regurgitations a brood received correlated significantly with the number of individual feeds when accounting for environment, but not with nest visit rate or the duration of time parents spent in the nestbox. In captive conditions, parents visited the nest at twice the rate of wild free-living birds, overall providing nestlings with twice the amount of food.

In Lincoln's Sparrows (Melospiza lincolnii), male bill shape is associated with the quality of songs, and song quality predicts female preferences in a reproductive context. Males and females that hatch later relative to brood mates or later in the breeding season tend to develop bill shapes that are, for males, associated with low-quality song. Because females do not sing and do not experience this selection pressure, we predicted that the sex of offspring produced late relative to their brood mates or relative to the season should be biased toward females. Using a molecular technique to sex nestlings, we found no effects of hatching order or any interaction between date of clutch initiation (season) and hatching order on offspring sex. However, we found a seasonal decline in the proportion of male offspring, from approximately 0.8 at the beginning to 0.4 at the end of a clutch initiation season only 19 d in duration. To our knowledge, this is the shortest period over which the offspring sex ratio has been shown to change in a bird population.

In most bilateria, the mechanisms that maintain consistent l-r asymmetry throughout development are poorly understood. This review highlights insights into mechanisms that couple early embryonic l-r symmetry breaking to subsequent l-r patterning in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. A recently identified strategy for l-r patterning in the early C. elegans embryo is discussed, the spatial separation of midline and anteroposterior axis, which relies on a rotational cellular rearrangement and non-canonical wnt signaling. evidence for a general relevance of rotational/torsional rearrangements during organismal l-r patterning and for non-canonical wnt signaling/planar cell polarity as a common signaling mechanism to maintain l-r asymmetry is presented.  2011 Landes Bioscience."

Nonetheless, our stress procedure had an impact on some egg characteristics: stressed females' eggs were heavier, contained more albumen and tended to have higher yolk testosterone levels than control females' eggs. Stressed females' offspring hatched earlier, were heavier at hatching and had a different growth pattern than did control females' offspring. They also appeared to have a higher emotional reactivity than control chicks when encountering a novel environment and they reacted more strongly following social separation. Our study revealed that mild stressors applied to laying Japanese quail can increase the emotional reactivity of their chicks and suggested that maternal stress effects on offspring are mediated by changes in egg composition and yolk testosterone levels. We stress the particular relevance to the poultry industry of our findings highlighting the importance of taking into account the environment of laying females, as this environment can influence their progeny's behaviour and therefore their subsequent adaptation to husbandry conditions and ultimately their welfare.  2011 Elsevier B.V."

These differences may influence fitness because selfmaintenance is considered as a life-history component along with growth and reproduction. In this review, we ask why do some individuals have two to three times the 'maintenance costs' of conspecifics, and what are the fitness consequences? Using evidence from a range of species, we demonstrate that diverse factors, such as genotypes, maternal effects, early developmental conditions and personality differences contribute to variation in individual RMR. We review evidence that RMR is linked with fitness, showing correlations with traits such as growth and survival. However, these relationships aremodulated by environmental conditions (e.g. food supply), suggesting that the fitness consequences of a given RMR may be context-dependent. Then, using empirical examples, we discuss broad-scale reasons why variation in RMR might persist in natural populations, including the role of both spatial and temporal variation in selection pressures and trans-generational effects. To conclude, we discuss experimental approaches that will enable more rigorous examination of the causes and consequences of individual variation in this key physiological trait.  2011 The Royal Society."

Today, there is unambiguous evidence that Lindstrm's first statement holds in longlived birds: ""It is obvious that adverse environmental conditions might have immediate effects [...]."" However, whether there are ""long-term fitness consequences of conditions experienced during early development"" (Lindstrm's second statement) is unclear for long-lived birds. The extent to which the disadvantage of frail individuals at independence is expressed predominantly in terms of higher mortality and disappearance from the population before recruitment, or persists after recruitment, is still an open question. Due to the rarity of relevant data and the fact that most studies are retrospective, heterogeneity in methods and timescales hampers the identification of general patterns. Nevertheless, several studies have provided evidence of a relationship between early conditions and future reproductive parameters, or lifetime reproductive success. Evidence from large mammals suggests substantial long-term individual and population effects of early conditions, including trans-generational maternal effects. Evidence from short-lived birds also suggests long-term individual consequences, and maternal effects have been documented in long-lived ones. Despite logistical and financial difficulties inherent in long-term studies, they are the only way of addressing Lindstrm's second statement. Existing long-term longitudinal datasets should be re-analyzed using recently developed capture-mark-recapture models handling state uncertainty and unobservable heterogeneity in populations. Statistical methods designed to estimate lifetime reproductive success or incorporate pedigree information in standard situations of studies of wild vertebrates with imperfect detection offer new opportunities to assess long-term fitness consequences of early development in long-lived birds.

Genetic variance for this threshold in reptiles has never been estimated under field conditions. Methods: We estimated variance components of the thermal sensitivity of the sex determination threshold under field conditions for the painted turtle, Chrysemys picta, a species that has temperature-dependent sex determination. Multiple paternity within clutches was identified by genotyping females and their offspring. We endeavoured to statistically account for common nest and maternal effects and estimated the genetic variance underlying the sex determination threshold under field conditions by isolating the contribution of sires within a single clutch. Results: With 51 clutches containing 393 offspring, we estimated significant heritability for the sex determination threshold (h2 = 0.351, 95% CI = [0.164, 0.832]). Using a more restrictive dataset, which included only those clutches where each sire was represented by at least two offspring (34 nests, 273 hatchlings), heritability was not significantly different from zero (h 2 = 0.173, 95% CI = [0.000, 0.628]). Paternal siring success did not influence hatchling sex; thus, we have no evidence to support differential sex allocation across different sires within the same nest.

Relationships are often reported between nestling growth and attributes of nestlings and parents, but the interpretation of these depends on the advantages a given growth difference confers to the chicks. Increased growth may have positive, negative or context-dependent effects on offspring fitness, but these effects are largely unknown in natural populations. We measured growth trajectories of body mass in fostered broods of collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) in 3 years of contrasting food conditions. We examined the growth of young and their recruitment probability to the breeding population in relation to year quality, hatching rank, sex, paternal age and paternal attractiveness. We also looked at the interactive effects of growth and intrinsic offspring attributes on recruitment probability. The predictors of nestling growth and those of recruitment did not agree. Moreover, the recruitment consequences of a given nestling growth rate were significantly influenced by nestling rank and paternal ornamentation. Differential recruitment effects of nestling growth in relation to parental traits and nestling attributes suggest that using growth as a generally applicable measure of nestling quality may not be justified.

To investigate the relationship between brood size, growth, and steroid hormone production in eastern bluebirds, we cross-fostered nestlings to small, medium, and large broods. Body mass, skeletal size, serum testosterone, and baseline serum corticosterone concentration were measured prior to fledging. Bluebird nestlings raised in large broods weighed less than nestlings in small and medium-sized broods and secreted elevated concentrations of testosterone. Nestling corticosterone concentrations did not vary in response to brood size or body condition, but concentrations were higher in males compared to females. Our results suggest that nestling bluebirds experiencing nutritional and social stress increase testosterone production. Elevated concentrations may enhance begging and competitive abilities in smaller young. Higher concentrations of corticosterone in males may be related to sex-biased provisioning.

Contrary to the predictions of sex-allocation theory, we found no relationship between maternal condition and progeny sex ratio. By contrast, progeny sex ratio shifted dramatically from female-biased to male-biased as paternal condition increased. This pattern was driven entirely by an increase in the production of sons as paternal condition improved. Despite strong natural selection favoring large size and high condition in both sons and daughters, we found no evidence that progeny survival was related to paternal condition.

In addition, we assessed to what extent personality influenced social dominance in a feeding context in this gregarious species. All personality traits were found to be highly repeatable within individuals. In addition, except for obstinacy, all of them were related to each other, thus defining a behavioural syndrome.

We show how developmental reaction norms that describe the effects of prior experience on a given behaviour can be used to determine whether the effects of a given experience at a given age will affect contextual generality at a later age, and to illustrate how variation within individuals in developmental plasticity leads to variation in contextual generality across individuals as a function of experience. We also show why niche-picking and niche-construction, behavioural processes which allow individuals to affect their own developmental environment, can affect the contextual generality and the temporal consistency of personality.

Social instability was applied to groups of laying Japanese quail females. We evaluated the impact of this procedure on laying females, on yolk steroid levels and on the general development of chicks.

This is assumed to be adaptive as these antibodies can be essential in protecting offspring early in life before their own immune system is fully developed. However, fitness consequences in natural conditions and the long-term effects of these mechanisms have yet to be fully examined. Exploring the ecological and evolutionary implications of such maternal effects requires experimental manipulations to avoid potential confounding maternal effects. In birds, maternal antibodies are transmitted via the egg yolk - a self contained embryonic environment in which antibodies can be manipulated independently outside the maternal environment. Here we use a novel technique to extract and experimentally manipulate maternal antibodies in the egg. Using the common quail (Coturnix coturnix), we demonstrate a blocking effect of antigen specific maternal antibodies received via egg injection, on the offspring's antibody response to an immune challenge with this antigen. Our results also suggest lower antibody production after a second immune challenge if maternal antibodies were present during first infection. Maternal antibodies thus have the potential to affect the development of offspring immunity. Our innovative technique will enable further work to manipulate the transfer of maternal antibodies per se whilst controlling for confounding effects linked to maternal vaccination. Because it also enables to manipulate the amount of antibodies transferred, it will facilitate further study of their adaptive value and ecological consequences in natural host-parasite systems.  2010 The Authors.

In black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla, early chick rearing seems to be more costly for females than males. We, thus, hypothesized that energetically constrained females may be responsible for the low feeding delivery causing brood-reduction. Furthermore, as previous studies have experimentally shown that only females reduce their feeding effort after brood-reduction, we hypothesized that females should decrease their investment after natural clutch or brood reduction. For three consecutive years, we observed parental attendance and feeding behaviour during chick rearing in pairs that hatched only one of their eggs, lost one of their two hatchlings or raised two chicks. We found that in pairs that lost one egg, parents behaved as predicted, with females showing low feeding effort. Furthermore, we found that before brood-reduction, females, but not males delivered less food to their chicks than parents that raised two chicks, and that A-chicks were more aggressive when females delivered less food to them. These results suggest that females may be responsible for brood-reduction. However, after brood-reduction, contrary to what was expected, females did not show lower feeding rate than females raising two chicks. We discuss two non-exclusive potential mechanisms at the origin of this result, namely that brood-reduction may be due to (i) low quality females that are not able to feed their two chicks enough or to (ii) females that adaptively restrained their feeding effort to maximize their residual reproductive value.  2010 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden."

In this chapter we first address the role of genetic polymorphisms and geneby-environment interactions for the emergence of such variation. Then, we discuss the role of the social environment for the modulation of behavioural development in mammals during different phases of life. The social environment in which the pregnant female lives is of major importance for foetal brain development and, as a consequence, for offspring behaviour later in life. The effects are likely to be mediated by maternal hormones. During the early postnatal phase, contact with social companions provides a secure base for the infants, buffering their stress responses in challenging situations. Moreover, variation in maternal care can bring about distinct differences in offspring behavioural profiles, and specific behavioural traits can even be transmitted across generations by epigenetic inheritance. Finally, behavioural strategies and stress responsiveness can be canalised by social experiences during adolescence as well. From an evolutionary perspective, the hypothesis arises that social modulation of behavioural development is a mechanism of rapid adaptation, adjusting the individual efficiently to prevailing environmental conditions.  2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The observation that testis size predicts mating systems suggested that testosterone may be an important proximate factor involved in the regulation of mating systems. Indeed, there is evidence that seasonal patterns of circulating testosterone are related to mating systems. Testosterone manipulations affect mating decisions in some, but not all species. In addition, the peptide hormones oxytocin and arginine vasopressin play a major role in pair-bond formation and the expression of different mating systems in mammals. Exciting recent studies indicated that changes in complex social behaviours may be based on the differential expression pattern of just one hormone receptor gene. Rather than social status itself, the process by which social status is achieved and maintained determines the physiological and psychosocial effects associated with a given social status. Current knowledge suggests that the relationship between behaviour and hormones can be quite complex. It also shows that the study of function and adaptive value of behavioural traits and hormonal processes is most successful if the links between the two are explicitly recognised.  2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

If this is the case, then reproductive life history and mating status should determine whether or not dietary restriction increases longevity. We investigate the effects of DR and mating status (mated or unmated) on longevity and lifetime reproductive output and explore mechanisms underlying these patterns by measuring resting energetic rates and changes in mass over time. We study iteroparous female Australian redback spiders (Latrodectus hasselti), which are known to tolerate periods of starvation (ecologically relevant DR) in nature. Mated DR females had the highest longevity of any experimental group, in strong contrast to results for semelparous males of this species [M.M. Kasumovic, M.C.B. Andrade & R.C. Brooks (2009), Biology Letters,5, 636]. Most strikingly, mated females (whether DR or not) had higher longevity than unmated females. Mated females rapidly decreased their resting energetic rates and stopped egg production under DR. Once feeding returned to normal, resting energetic rates of mated females increased immediately, egg sac production continued and there was no net decrease in lifetime reproductive output relative to mated females without DR. This shows DR increases longevity for mated females, but there is a longevity cost of remaining unmated, which may arise because unmated females (regardless of diet) maintained high energetic rates. This may be an evolved pattern of physiological support for reproductive readiness which exerts a fitness cost when mating is delayed. Taken together, these results suggest positive effects of DR on longevity critically depend on reproductive life history (iteroparity or semelparity) and individual mating status.  2010 The Authors.

Such convergence is explained by common selection regimes, as all social systems are shaped by sex-specific tactics and strategies to optimise their reproductive success. In addition, the major social mechanisms, brain and physiology, are highly conserved throughout the vertebrates. Manoeuvring social contexts tends to be energetically costly and, hence, favours efficient decision-making. Therefore, at least in vertebrates, complex social systems generally select for social cognition. As an example for social convergence between mammals and birds, we introduce the surprisingly complex social system of greylag geese, featuring components such as a female-bonded clan structure, long parent-offspring relationships, as well as elaborate and highly functional patterns of mutual social support. Our results show that partners in reproductively successful goose pairs are in hormonal synchrony and provide social support to each other. We suggest that social support may be a major structuring principle of other social systems with long-term individualized and valuable partnerships as well. In general, individual performance in social systems is determined by the interplay between proximate mechanisms and ultimate functions.  2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. All rights reserved."

We show that artificially inseminated females stimulated by highly displaying males increased their hatching success, owing to increased fertilization success. The females also increased the allocation of maternal androgens in their eggs, leading to an increase of circulating testosterone and growth rate in chicks. Hence, visual stimulation of the females can promote differential maternal allocation and favour offspring fitness. Our results further suggest that using artificial insemination for species conservation without appropriate stimulation of the breeding females probably has negative impacts on their breeding performance and therefore on population viability.  2010 The Royal Society."

However, despite a decade of research, the underlying mechanism linking digit ratio to these sex hormone-dependent traits remains unclear. Previous work suggests that during embryo development, circulating levels of plasma androgens or oestrogens may act through their receptors to affect transcription levels of posterior HOX genes in the developing digits, thereby possibly influencing their relative length. The correlation between digit ratio and sex hormone-dependent traits might thus stem from variation in expression or sensitivity of the sex hormone receptors, or from variation in sex hormone levels in the embryo. Here, we show that in a population of 1156 zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata, a polymorphism in the oestrogen receptor a gene (ESR1) explains 11.3 per cent of the variation in digit ratio, and is also associated with male and female-mating behaviour. By contrast, we found no associations between digit ratio or mating behaviours and polymorphisms in the androgen receptor gene. Thus, our results (i) provide an explanation for the observed significant genetic covariance between digit ratio and male and female mating behaviour and (ii) strongly confirm the indicator function of digit ratio through the oestrogen pathway. Finally, we note that the commonly invoked effect of foetal testosterone on human digit ratio seems to be substantially weaker than the effect described here.  2010 The Royal Society."

This study investigated the effects of maternal state and food availability on the capacity of female lesser black-backed gulls Larus fuscus to provision their eggs with macronutrients and steroid hormones. Maternal state was reduced by increasing egg-production effort, whereas extra food was provided to reverse this effect. Compared with eggs of first clutches, eggs of experimentally induced replacement clutches exhibited a lower yolk/albumen ratio and contained more yolk testosterone. During one of the three years in which the study was performed, replacement eggs also contained more 17b-estradiol. Food provisioning during the relaying interval did not affect changes in yolk/albumen ratio or steroid concentrations, but fed females produced bigger eggs in their replacement clutch. This study demonstrates significant within-female consistency in egg size, macronutrient content, and yolk steroid concentration, and it shows that these egg characteristics are influenced by maternal state, food availability, and the timing of breeding.  2010 by The University of Chicago."

Altered deposition of yolk steroids can change the developmental trajectory of the embryo and have long lasting or permanent consequences. Alligators from contaminated environments have shown significant reproductive and developmental dysfunction, and it is unclear if altered deposition of yolk steroids could be a contributing factor. Alligator eggs were collected from Lake Woodruff (a reference lake), Lake Apopka (a site of known agricultural contamination), and the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge (MINWR) (home of the Kennedy Space Center and a site of heavy metal contamination). The yolks of eggs at embryonic stages 12 (prior to sex determination) and 24 (post-sex determination) were evaluated for concentrations of progesterone, 17-beta estradiol, and testosterone. Yolk concentrations of progesterone were significantly lower at embryonic stage 12 in eggs from Lake Apopka and MINWR when compared to eggs from Lake Woodruff. Yolk concentrations of 17-beta estradiol were significantly lower at embryonic stage 12 in eggs from MINWR when compared to the other two sites. Reductions in yolk 17-beta estradiol concentrations from embryonic stage 12 to 24 were significantly attenuated in eggs from MINWR versus that of Lakes Woodruff and Apopka. This study suggests that altered deposition of yolk steroids, and possibly differential utilization by the embryo, could be a contributory mechanism in the reproductive and developmental abnormalities seen in alligators from contaminated locales.  2010 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc."

Yet, individuals may be affected differently, depending on the developmental period during which constraints are experienced. Here we tested whether the nestling phase compared to the fledgling phase is more susceptible to nutritional stress by considering biometry, physiology, sexually selected male ornaments and survival using zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) as a model species. As nestlings (day 0-17) or fledglings (day 17-35), subjects were raised either on low or high quality food. A low quality diet resulted in significantly elevated baseline corticosterone titres in both nestlings and fledglings. Subjects showed substantial compensatory growth after they had experienced low quality food as nestlings but catch-up growth did neither lead to elevated baseline corticosterone titres nor did we detect long term effects on biometry, male cheek patch, or survival. The compensation for temporally unfavourable environmental conditions reflects substantial phenotypic plasticity and the results show that costs of catch-up growth were not mediated via corticosterone as a physiological correlate of allostatic load. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms and plasticity with which animals respond to periods of constraints during development as they may occur in a mistiming of breeding.  2010 Honarmand et al."

Despite a growing body of literature on personality traits, the effects of selection for fast and slow exploration on GC secretion have received little attention. We compared baseline and stress-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity of hand-reared great tit nestlings of lines selected for fast and slow exploration. Nestling droppings were collected under three conditions: control, test (following handling stress, day 14 after hatching) and the following day. The concentrations of excreted immunoreactive corticosterone metabolites (CM) were determined via an enzyme immunoassay. We also observed nestlings' begging behaviour. CM differed significantly between the lines. Nestlings of the fast line excreted lower CM than slow-line birds. In response to handling stress, nestlings excreted significantly higher concentrations of CM than during the control and on the day after handling. Sex and begging activity were not related to CM levels. Under the control condition, but not after handling, males begged significantly more often than females. In both lines, adults excreted significantly less CM compared to nestlings. Both nestlings and adults of the slow line produced higher baseline CM values than fast-line birds. Fast-line nestlings excreted lower baseline CM than nestlings of a wild population not selected for fast or slow exploration. Slow-line nestlings did not.

We tested the hypothesis that higher stress responsiveness would correspond to chronic accumulation and thus higher concentrations of corticosterone in egg yolks after exposure to stres-sors associated with routine maintenance. Eggs were collected from white and brown hens that were undisturbed except for daily feeding and routine egg collections. Corticosterone was quantified in plasma, egg yolks, and albumen and compared between strains. We predicted that corticosterone concentrations in yolk would be higher in eggs from white versus brown hens but that albumen corticosterone would not differ between strains due to the short term of albumen deposition. As predicted, yolk corticosterone concentrations were significantly higher in eggs produced by white hens, approximately twice those found in eggs laid by brown hens. Plasma and albumen concentrations of corticosterone were similar between groups. These results suggest that offspring hatching from eggs laid by White Leghorn hens are exposed to significantly more corticosterone through concentration in the egg yolk, which could permanently imprint offspring physiology and behavior.  2010 Poultry Science Association Inc."

Using an insect herbivore, the winter moth (Operophtera brumata) feeding on oak (Quercus robur), we show that maternal effects can affect seasonal timing of egg hatching in an herbivore in an adaptive way. Winter moth egg-hatching needs to coincide with oak bud opening, as only freshly emerged leaves are suitable as food for the caterpillars. However, there is spatial variation in the timing of bud opening among oaks to which the winter moth needs to adapt. We show experimentally that the generation time between the mother's and her offsprings' hatching dates was shorter for mothers who hatched late relative to bud opening of the tree they had to feed on (and hence had to feed on older leaves) than for mothers' who hatched on time. Maternal feeding conditions affected both the larval and the pupal development time of the mother as well as the egg development time of her offspring: at all three stages developmental time was shorter for the mistimed treatment. We thus show that adaptation to spatial variation may be achieved via maternal effects. While this is a mechanism selected to adapt to spatial variation, it may now also play a role in adaptation to climate change induced shifts in host phenology, and allow insect herbivores to adapt to changes in the seasonal timing of their food availability without the need for genetic change.  2010 The Authors.

In long-lived animals that live in highly variable and unpredictable environments, dynamic sexual traits may provide updated information on the condition of the mate and hence, females may adjust breeding effort accordingly. The blue-footed booby is a socially monogamous long-lived tropical seabird with an extended period of biparental care. Males and females display colorful feet during courtship and experimental evidence suggests that foot color has been favored by mutual mate preferences. Foot color is a dynamic carotenoid-based trait that honestly indicates the nutritional and immunological state of the individual, and is related to paternal quality, and females rapidly adjust their investment in eggs according to changes in the mates' foot coloration. Furthermore, there seems to be a trade-off between female ornamentation and fecundity mediated by carotenoid availability, suggesting that males should not prefer highly ornamented females that invest heavily in coloration incurring fecundity costs. Using long-term data, we found that as individuals age and accumulate the negative effects of breeding effort, foot color deteriorates. Interestingly, after nonbreeding events males display more colorful and attractive feet compared to nonskipping males, suggesting that senescence of sexual signaling might be mitigated by taking sabbatical years. Additionally, increased levels of oxidative stress impaired foot color of senescent males, suggesting that oxidative stress affects senescence of a sexual trait and that sexual ornamentation may be more honest in aging animals. Our results highlight the importance of dynamic traits for continuous pair evaluation and the potential life history consequences of investment on sexual ornamentation.  2010 Elsevier Inc."

However, understanding optimal resource allocation to immune defence requires also identification of its benefits, which are likely to occur only when parasites are abundant. Methodology: We manipulated the abundance of parasitic hen fleas in blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) nests, and supplemented their hosts, the nestlings, with methionine (a sulphur amino acid enhancing cell-mediated immunity) during day 3-6. We found a significant interaction between these two experimental factors on the development of immune defences and growth rates. Only in parasitized nests did methionine supplementation boost immune (PHA) response, and did nestling with experimentally increased immunocompetence show a relatively faster growth rate than control nestlings between days 6-9. Hence, the allocation of resources into immune defence and its growth-benefits are apparent only in presence of parasites. The main cost of methionine-induced increased allocation to the immune system was an increase in mortality, independently of ectoparasites. Nestlings in all treatments compensated initial growth reduction and all reached equal body size at day 16 (just prior to fledging), indicating a lack of long-term benefits. In addition, methionine treatment tended (P =0.09) to lower circulating plasma immunoglobulin levels, possibly indicating a trade-off between the cell-mediated and humoral components of the immune system. Conclusions:We found no strong benefits of an increased investment in immunocompetence in a parasite-rich environment. Any deviation from the growth trajectory (due to changes in allocation induced by methionine) is largely detrimental for survival. Hence, while costs are apparent identifying the benefits of investment in immunocompetence during ontogeny is challenging.  2010 Pitala et al."

The information content of melanin-based signals is unclear as their expression is tightly controlled by genes and, apparently, is less dependent on individual condition. In birds, high heritabilities have been attributed to melanin-based plumages, often on the basis of eggswapping manipulations (cross-fostering experiments). However, it is well known that female birds can differentially transfer testosterone to the egg yolk. Furthermore, high testosterone levels have been related to high oxidative stress. As we recently found that oxidative stress experienced during development influences the expression of melanin-based traits, here we manipulated the level of yolk testosterone in great tits (Parus major) to assess the influence of this maternal effect on the expression of the black breast stripe, a well-known melanin-based signal. We predicted that fledglings hatched from eggs with high testosterone levels will not only show larger black stripes but also experience changes in their antioxidant machinery. Indeed, the size of the black stripe of great tits hatched from testosterone-injected eggs was almost double that of controls. Furthermore, the same individuals showed a trend to higher levels of circulating antioxidants, which suggests an adaptive response against some testosterone-induced oxidative challenge.  2010 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd."

In this study, we examined the effects of early exposure to elevated stress hormone levels (corticosterone, CORT) on parental behavior during incubation in male and female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) breeding in both stressful and nonstressful conditions as adults. We found that female birds fed CORT during postnatal development exhibited reduced incubation effort under both breeding conditions. There were no effects of developmental CORT exposure on male incubation effort; however, males breeding in unpredictable feeding conditions significantly reduced their effort levels compared with control males. There were no effects of either of our experimental treatments on hatching success or length of the incubation period. This may have been due to partial compensation by females paired with males that reduced effort. Our results clearly demonstrate sex-specific responses to developmental and adult environmental conditions in terms of incubation behavior and while in this captive population fitness costs appear to be ameliorated, birds breeding in a less benign environment in the wild may face higher costs having downstream effects on current or future reproduction.  2010 The Author."

In species with parental care, conflicts among family members impose selection on parental and offspring behaviour through coadaptation. Here, we argue that the interplay between the evolution of personality traits (i.e. boldness, exploration, activity, aggressiveness and sociability) expressed outside the family context and the specialized behaviours expressed inside families (i.e. offspring begging behaviour and parental response to offspring solicitations) can have important evolutionary consequences. Personality differences between parents may relate to the typically observed variation in the way they respond to offspring demand, and dependent offspring may already express personality differences, which may relate to the way they communicate with their parents and siblings. However, there has been little research on how personality relates to parental and offspring behaviours. Future research should thus focus on how and why personality may be related to the specialized parent and offspring behaviour that evolved as adaptations to family life.  2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH."

Studies of this species have examined the importance of maternal effects mediated through sex allocation, size, nutrients and hormones of of eggs, incubation behaviour and provisioning levels. A synthesis of all of this work illustrates some contrasting results (e.g. many high-profile results have failed to be replicated), some very common patterns (e.g. investment shifts through the laying sequence), and potentially interesting and complex interactions between traits (e.g. between sex of offspring and hormonal profiles of eggs). This extensive collection of work on the Zebra Finch provides useful general insight into the patterns of maternal investment in birds and the effects on offspring phenotype.

In this study, the degree to which seasonal climate experienced during juvenile and adult life-cycle stages affects the SMRS of a cricket, Allonemobius socius (Scudder) (Orthoptera: Gryllidae) was assessed. Results from two-choice behavioral trials suggest that adult ambient temperature, along with population and family origins, mediate variation in male mating call, and to a lesser extent directional response of females for those calls. Restricted maximum-likelihood estimates of heritability for male mating call components and for female response to mating call appeared statistically nonsignificant. However, appreciable ""maternal genetic effects"" suggest that maternal egg provisioning and other indirect maternal determinants of the embryonic environment significantly contributed to variation in male mating call and female response to mating calls. Thus, environmental factors can generate substantial variation in A. socius mating call, and, more importantly, their marginal effect on female responses to either fast-chirp or long-chirp mating calls suggest negative fitness consequences to males producing alternative types of calls. Future studies of sexual selection and SMRS evolution, particularly those focused on hybrid zone dynamics, should take explicit account of the loose concordance between signal producers and responders suggested by the current findings."

Canada Geese lay large clutches (7-9 eggs) and initiate incubation before completing them (approximately with egg 3), but the young hatch and leave the nest synchronously.

Neither shell thickness nor rates of yolk accumulation were related to the egg's position in the sequence. We hypothesize that, in waterfowl and other species that lay large clutches and initiate incubation prior to completion of the clutch, changes in the shell gland during egg laying lead to the production of progressively more porous eggs that promote vascularization of the chorioallantoic membrane of the embryo to sustain the higher metabolic and developmental rates necessary for synchronous hatching.

Because of relatively high levels of agonism toward conspecifics, spiders have been a popular focus for behavioral-ecological examinations of conspecific predation, or cannibalism. Surprisingly, studies examining the underlying, proximate assumption that cannibalism in spiders is a heritable trait shaped by interactions between genes and the environment are virtually non-existent. Here, we examine the influence of family on the expression of sibling cannibalism in the post-hatching, group-living phase of an otherwise solitary, web-building spider, the North American black widow (Latrodectus hesperus). Our results showed significant levels of variation in cannibalistic propensity among 26 sibships, with some families cannibalizing full sibs within 2 d and other families waiting 3 wk before resorting to cannibalism. A similar family-level effect was evident in measures of sibling cohabitation, voracity toward cricket prey, and development speed. Negative correlations between maternal egg sac investment and offspring cannibalism suggest that this family effect may stem, at least in part, from a maternal effect, although we were not able to directly test the prediction that cannibalism is most common from spiderlings in poor condition. Thus, we present novel data suggesting family effects seem to be responsible for cannibalism in L. hesperus spiderlings; however, future work will be required to disentangle the relative importance of shared genes and shared maternal environment. We discuss several mechanisms that could explain the persistence of family-level variation in cannibalism, a trait that seems likely to be subject to strong directional selection.  2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH."

Poly P was localized to granules randomly distributed in the sea urchin eggs, as shown by labelling with the poly-P-binding domain of Escherichia coli exopolyphosphatase. These granules were enriched using iodixanol centrifugation and shown to be acidic and to contain poly P, as determined by Acridine Orange and DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2- phenylindole) staining respectively. These granules also contained large amounts of calcium, sodium, magnesium, potassium and zinc, as detected by X-ray microanalysis, and bafilomycin A1-sensitive ATPase, pyrophosphatase and exopolyphosphatase activities, as well as Ca2+/H+ and Na+/H+ exchange activities, being therefore similar to acidocalcisomes described in other organisms. Calcium release from these granules induced by nigericin was associated with poly P hydrolysis. Although NAADP (nicotinic acid-adenine dinucleotide phosphate) released calcium from the granule fraction, this activity was not significantly enriched as compared with the NAADP-stimulated calcium release from homogenates and was not accompanied by poly P hydrolysis.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which the maternal information is decoded by cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) associated with muscle transcription factor and structural genes, and the ways by which a seamless transition from maternal to zygotic transcription is ensured, are still mostly unclear. By combining misexpression assays with CRM analyses, we have identified the mechanisms through which Ciona Macho1 (Ci-Macho1) initiates expression of Ci-Tbx6b and Ci-Tbx6c, and we have unveiled the cross-regulatory interactions between the latter transcription factors. Knowledge acquired from the analysis of the Ci-Tbx6b CRM facilitated both the identification of a related CRM in the Ci-Tbx6c locus and the characterization of two CRMs associated with the structural muscle gene fibrillar collagen 1 (CiFCol1).

This would escalate the level of offspring demand ad infinitum, but most of the models on the evolution of parent-offspring communication predict that begging must be costly, such costs limiting the escalation and defining an optimal level of begging. However, empirical evidence on this issue is mixed. A potential begging cost that remains to be accurately explored is a decrease in immunocompetence for offspring begging fiercely. This study experimentally analyses this cost in house sparrow (Passer domesticus) nestlings. A group of nestlings was forced to beg fiercely for a prolonged time while a control group begged at low levels, both groups receiving the same quantity of food. At the same time, the nestling response to an antigen (phytohaemagglutinin) was measured. Nestlings forced to beg fiercely showed a reduction in immunocompetence with respect to control chicks, but the two groups showed no difference in growth rate. The largest and the smallest nestlings in each brood showed a similar response to the treatment. These results strongly suggest a trade-off between begging and immunocompetence in this species. This trade-off may be a consequence either of resources from the immune system being reallocated to begging behaviour, or of adaptive immunosuppression in order to avoid oxidative stress. Steroid hormones are proposed as mediators of such a trade-off. 2010 The Royal Society."

Though adjustments to yolk allocation have been well-characterized as a function of parental phenotypes, we know very little about how an individual's social environment influences yolk composition. Here, we consider how two types of yolk compounds, androgens and carotenoids, relate to the maternal social environment during the egg-laying period, controlling statistically for known correlations between various aspects of parental quality and egg yolk compounds. Barn swallows Hirundo rustica erythrogaster breed in groups of highly variable size and spacing, allowing us to test whether or not the social environment is correlated with these maternal effects. We found no relationship between carotenoid levels in eggs as a function of colony size, colony density, or nearest-neighbor distance. However, eggs from females in larger groups had lower concentrations and total amounts of yolk androgens than those from females in smaller, less dense social settings. Our results counter previous predictions and literature, showing that females breeding in large groups deposit more androgen in eggs, mechanistically, because they compete more with conspecifics and have higher circulating androgen levels themselves and, functionally, because it could be advantageous for their offspring to show high androgen-mediated competitive abilities early in life. Instead, because group size in this species is governed largely by site fidelity and the availability of old nests for re-use, and because reproductive output does not differ as a function of group size, it may be that competition is greater for limited nests in small groups, thus elevating androgen levels. Further, yolk androgens were previously shown to be affected by male quality, and the greater concentrations and amounts of yolk androgens in smaller sites may reflect differential allocation to darker males found at these sites.  2010 The Authors."

Plasma, ovarian follicles (separated into yolking and non-yolking samples), and shelled oviductal eggs were collected at times ranging from 15min to 24hr after treatment. Main effects of tissue, time, and an interaction between them all existed on recovered 3H-hormone corrected for tissue mass. Of particular interest, there was a decrease in plasma with coincident increase in eggs. In Experiment 2, females were injected with doses ranging from 0.01 to 0.45mCi of 3H-T per gram body weight. Across tissues, 3H-hormone levels corrected for mass were greater with increasing doses. Values also differed among tissues and an interaction was detected. Within each dose, plasma and non-yolking follicles generally had higher concentrations of 3H-hormone than did yolking follicles and oviductal eggs. However, at and after 6hr, eggs had higher total radioactivity levels than both yolking and non-yolking follicles had (not corrected for mass). The results indicate that steroids can cross through relatively well-formed shells before oviposition, suggesting a way in which maternal hormones might influence developmental factors after yolk deposition.  2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

In oscines, female investment is influenced by the quality of male song. In domestic canaries Serinus canaria, as well as in black-capped chickadees Poecile atricapillus, females pay attention not only to the intrinsic quality of male song but can also gather information, by eavesdropping on male-male singing interactions, on the relative quality of males. During these interactions, overlapping the song of the rival is more threatening than alternating. Moreover eavesdropping female canaries have been shown to prefer the overlapping song rather than the overlapped song. The present study was designed to assess the effect of the information gathered by eavesdropping on female investment in eggs. First, we broadcasted overlapping interactions to female canaries. Then, we broadcasted to each female one of the two songs previously heard and collected eggs. Females exposed to overlapping songs laid eggs with greater yolk ratio than females exposed to overlapped songs. In contrast, yolk testosterone quantity and concentration were not affected by the treatment. Moreover, we found a variation between eggs with regard to the testosterone deposited in yolk: both quantity and concentration increased with laying order.

Studies elevating testosterone in breeding female birds have, in most instances, found detrimental effects, such as delayed clutch initiation or decreased clutch size. In our previous study, testosterone treatment of female homing pigeons delayed clutch initiation without diminishing fecundity. In this study, we explore whether the observed effect might have been caused by testosterone influencing follicle maturation or ovulation. We implanted mature female pigeons with testosterone prior to pairing, which resulted in constant elevation of circulating testosterone concentrations within the physiological range. We killed females after they had laid the first egg and measured ovarian and follicular development. Ovarian mass and pre-hierarchical yolky follicles were not affected by the treatment; however, testosterone females produced smaller and lighter preovulatory follicles. High plasma testosterone levels at oviposition or a strong temporal increase in testosterone were negatively related to mass and diameter of second follicles. We proposed that sustained elevation of testosterone delays follicular maturation, potentially via negative feedback on the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis. Furthermore, to gain better insight into the regulation of yolk hormone acquisition, we measured testosterone concentrations in the preovulatory follicles. We found no differences between treatment groups but follicle yolk contained much higher levels of testosterone than yolk of unincubated eggs, suggesting that hormone measurements performed after oviposition do not correctly reflect maternal allocation.  2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Individual behavioral characteristics appear to be consistent over time and across situations. The individual variation has at least two dimensions in which the quality of the response to a challenging condition (coping style) is independent from the quantity of that response (stress reactivity). The neurobiology reveals important differences in the homeostatic control of the serotonergic neuron and the neuropeptides vasopressin and oxytocin in relation to coping style.

Sexually selected signals must be associated with costs in order to ensure their honesty as indicator of male quality. Costs may relate to the development of the neural substrate underlying song learning, which develops already very early in life. Song may, therefore, serve as an indicator of the early developmental history. This nutritional stress hypothesis has initially been confirmed for a variety of species, but recent studies using zebra finches as a model species reported somewhat inconsistent effects, and the functional consequences of changes in adult song phenotype remain unclear. We tested the nutritional stress hypothesis in canaries by manipulating either the brood size or the food quality postfledging. The brood size manipulation had a significant effect on early development, and low food quality postfledging led to a transient reduction in body mass. However, we did not find evidence that any of the song traits measured reflected the early developmental conditions, which is in conflict with the nutritional stress hypothesis. Canaries may be less vulnerable to nutritional stress or are able to compensate stressful conditions during early development. However, if males compensated, this compensation may have come at a survival cost. Female mate choice decisions were independent of the developmental history of a male. Instead, females preferred males singing longer song bouts, a trait that may contain a heritable component.  2010 Springer-Verlag."

Such 'maternal' effects act both before and after hatching via, e. g., egg quality or the social milieu predisposed by parents. Resource availability may constrain the expression of adaptive maternal effects, and the specific pattern of allocation of these effects among offspring depending on their sex or birth order can result in different fitness payoffs to parents. Declining egg mass with laying order observed in several bird species may constitute an adaptive strategy of parental favouritism towards early hatching offspring with larger reproductive value but may also result from nutritional constraints on laying effort. A previous study has shown that the small size of the third, last laid (c-)egg in yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) clutches depends on food availability and that food-supplemented mothers increase the size of their female but not male c-eggs. Here, we show that increased mass of c-eggs laid by females supplemented with food after clutch initiation depends on increased albumen mass, which, in turn, enhances the size of daughters at hatching. Because asynchronous hatching results in a competitive disadvantage of c-chicks, present results suggest that mothers relieved from nutritional constraints enhance the size of daughters to compensate for their larger susceptibility to hatching last. The study also confirms the role of egg albumen content in determining hatchling size, previously experimentally detected only in one species in the wild. The effect of increased egg mass on offspring size persisted at least until day 8 after hatching, when, however, it did not vary with sex, suggesting intense negative selection on small female c-chicks in control broods. Hence, maternal effects mediated by egg albumen content had persistent effects on offspring size.  2010 Springer-Verlag."

We used 15N stable isotope analysis to relate foraging behavior to yolk carotenoid deposition in two seabirds, Cassin's auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) and rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata), during each of five years. As expected from their narrower trophic range, Cassin's auklets produced yolks with fewer carotenoid types than did rhinoceros auklets (one vs. three). Cassin's auklets also fed on a lower trophic level diet richer in carotenoids, yet had lower total yolk carotenoid levels, which suggests a role for species-specific adaptations for carotenoid uptake and utilization. Within both species, lower trophic-level feeding was linked to higher yolk carotenoid levels, but through different mechanisms. In Cassin's auklets, it was due to a population-wide response to environmental variation: in warm-water years, all females fed at a low trophic level and produced carotenoid-rich yolks. In rhinoceros auklets, it was due to individual differences similarly expressed in all years: females fed across a wide trophic range, and those that fed at a low trophic level produced carotenoid-rich yolks. Rhinoceros auklets bred more successfully in years when their yolks were rich in carotenoids, probably due to a correlated response to stronger marine primary production. Our results are novel because they link avian yolk carotenoid deposition to behavioral and environmental variations.  2010 Her Majesty the Queen in Rights of Canada."

However, in species where the amount of A4 in the yolk much exceeds that of the other androgens, A4 could represent the dominant agent of androgen-mediated maternal effects, in which case manipulations of T would be misdirected. We conducted our study in a species with high yolk A4 and relatively low T and DHT levels, the Japanese quail Coturnix japonica. We injected unincubated eggs with a physiological dose of either A4, T, or DHT, and measured hatchling growth, as well as behaviour in an open field test.

In contrast, when individuals are constrained to define their condition absolutely, environmental fluctuations induce fluctuating sex ratios and the evolutionary loss of condition-dependent sex allocation in short-lived organisms. Here, we present a simulation model of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) in fluctuating environments that specifically examines the importance of relativity in defining individual condition. When relativity in condition is allowed to evolve, short-lived organisms evolve switchlike TSD reaction norms and define their condition relative to the annual temperature distribution, thus preventing biased cohort sex ratios in extreme years. Long-lived organisms also evolve switchlike reaction norms, but define condition less relatively and experience biased cohort sex ratios. The predictions are supported by data from painted turtles, where TSD reaction norms exhibit pivotal temperatures of sex determination that partially track mean annual temperature. Examining relativity in amniotic vertebrates provides a conceptual framework for multifactorial sex determination and suggests new ways of exploring adaptive hypotheses of sex allocation by focusing on the importance of frequency-dependent selection on sex.  2010 The Author(s).

Antimicrobial proteins (lysozyme, ovotransferrin, and avidin) are significant components of the avian albumen and likely aid in defense of embryos from microbial infection. Within clutches, females may enhance antimicrobial defense of early-laid eggs to protect them from the high risk of infection incurred before the onset of incubation. Among entire clutches, females may invest more resources in young sired by more attractive males because they have higher reproductive value. We tested these hypotheses by quantifying antimicrobial protein distribution within and among clutches in blue tit eggs. Contrary to our hypothesis, clutches showed no differential deposition of lysozyme or avidin within clutches, but eggs laid in the middle of the sequence had higher concentrations of ovotransferrin than eggs in the beginning and end. Consistent with our second hypothesis, we found that females produced eggs with higher concentrations of lysozyme (although not ovotransferrin or avidin) when mated to more attractive (more UV-reflective) males. Furthermore, females mated to polygynous males deposited less lysozyme than those mated to monogamous males.

Although several experiments have demonstrated that short-term food deprivation causes a temporary increase in aggression, no study has, to our knowledge, experimentally manipulated overall food supplies and considered long-term effects on chick behaviour and life history traits. We provided supplemental food to breeding pairs of black-legged kittiwakes, Rissa tridactyla, over an entire breeding season and compared the aggressive behaviour of their chicks with that of chicks of control pairs. Control A-chicks (first to hatch) showed more frequent and intense aggression than their experimental counterparts. Furthermore, the more A-chicks begged and the lower their growth rate the more aggressive they were. The consequences of increased aggression for B-chicks (second to hatch) were lower begging rate, lower growth rate and lower survival. We thus provide evidence that a sustained increase in food availability affects broodmate aggression and chick survival at the nest and we discuss the various proximate and ultimate causes involved in the evolution of broodmate aggression.  2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

One possible reason for this neglect is confusion about many of the concepts and terms that are necessary to study the development of animal personality. Here, we provide a framework for studying personality development that focuses on the properties of animal personality, and considers how and why these properties may change over time. We specifically focus on three dimensions of personality: (1) contextual generality at a given age or time, (2) temporal consistency in behavioural traits and in relationships between traits, and (3) the effects of genes and experience on the development of personality at a given age or life stage. We advocate using a new approach, contextual reaction norms, to study the contextual generality of personality traits at the level of groups, individuals and genotypes, show how concepts and terms borrowed from the literature on personality development in humans can be used to study temporal changes in personality at the level of groups and individuals, and demonstrate how classical developmental reaction norms can provide insights into the ways that genes and experiential factors interact across ontogeny to affect the expression of personality traits. In addition, we discuss how correlations between the effects of genes and experience on personality development can arise as a function of individuals' control over their own environment, via niche-picking or niche-construction. Using this framework, we discuss several widely held assumptions about animal personality development that still await validation, identify neglected methodological issues, and describe a number of promising new avenues for future research.  2009 Cambridge Philosophical Society."

Female birds are the heterogametic sex, thus potentially controlling the sex of the gamete to be fertilized. In several bird species, independent studies showed effects of maternal plasma testosterone, corticosterone, or condition on primary offspring sex ratio. Our objective was to investigate the causal relation between these two maternal hormones, body condition, and offspring sex ratio in homing pigeons (Columba livia domestica). Following our earlier study, we again implanted females with testosterone and determined embryo sex of first eggs. To identify the pathway of sex ratio adjustment, we repeatedly measured not only maternal plasma testosterone and mass but also plasma corticosterone, cholesterol, and glucose, all indicators of body condition. We also calculated the temporal change in these parameters, which has been proposed to be a more accurate predictor of offspring sex ratio compared with the absolute values. Furthermore, we analyzed testosterone concentrations inouteryolk layers, which potentially influence the first meiotic division of the gamete. We found no relation between plasma parameter and embryo sex of first eggs; testosterone treatment did not affect any of the measured parameters. However, females that increased in mass produced more male embryos, irrespective of treatment group. Outer yolk layer testosterone concentrations did not differ between treatment groups or between male and female eggs. We propose that not only the absolute values but also the complex interactions between maternal hormones and body condition ultimately affect the mechanism of primary offspring sex manipulation.  2010 by The University of Chicago.

However, key questions remain about how diet and species traits influence carotenoid allocation. We studied yolk carotenoid profiles and yolk color in relation to trophic level (based on 15N values) in five species of seabirds belonging to the family Alcidae: common murre (Uria aalge), pigeon guillemot (Cepphus columba), Cassin's auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus), rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata), and tufted puffin (Fratercula cirrhata). In three species, which ranged from low (tufted puffin) to high (pigeon guillemot) trophic level, yolks had pink to red hues and contained exclusively astaxanthin, while yolks of species from a high trophic level (common murre) and from a generalist forager (rhinoceros auklet) had yellow to orange hues and contained astaxanthin, lutein, and zeaxanthin. The absence of a systematic relationship between trophic level and carotenoid types suggests that these species possess adaptations for the uptake and use of specific carotenoids. In contrast, total yolk carotenoid concentrations were best explained by the combination of species and trophic level: lower-trophic-level feeding was linked to production of carotenoid-rich yolks, both across species and within the one generalist species. We conclude that both behavioral and physiological traits can play strong roles in the acquisition and allocation of critical nutrients from mothers to their offspring.  2010 by The University of Chicago.

The introductory chapter covers the basic body plan of birds and their still-enigmatic evolutionary history. The focus then shifts to a consideration of the essential components of that most fundamental of avian attributes: the ability to fly. The emphasis is on feather evolution and development, flight energetics and aerodynamics, migration, and as a counterpoint, the curious secondary evolution of flightlessness that has occurred in several lineages. This sets the stage for subsequent chapters, which present specific physiological topics within a strongly ecological and environmental framework. Chapter 2 covers gas exchange and thermal and osmotic balance, together with the central role of body size. Chapter 3 addresses 'classical' life history parameters - male and female reproductive costs, parental care and investment in offspring, and fecundity versus longevity tradeoffs - from an eco-physiological perspective. Chapter 4 offers a comprehensive analysis of feeding and digestive physiology, adaptations to challenging environments (high altitude, deserts, marine habitats, cold), developmental adaptations, and neural specializations (notably those important in foraging, long-distance navigation, and song production). Throughout the book, classical studies are integrated with the latest research findings. Numerous important and intriguing questions await further work, and the book concludes with a discussion of research methods and approaches - emphasizing cutting-edge technology - and a final chapter on future directions that should help point the way forward for both young and senior scientists.

Though the importance of maternal carryover effects on embryos and early juveniles is well established, it is less clear how long the effects persist and whether they can be detected in subsequent life stages of the offspring. Manipulating the amount of food available to a maternal organism is one way to manipulate maternal investment ability and thereby test maternal carryover. We collected adult brooding Leptasterias aequalis from three beaches with varying prey communities in the northern Puget Sound. When broods were released, we measured size and survival of the juveniles under starvation conditions. The maternal sea stars were then assigned to different feeding treatments and their diets were controlled for a full year until they spawned again. We measured size and growth of juveniles released from these second broods. Juvenile L. aequalis from the initial broods showed surprising resistance to starvation with 80% survival after 6 months and some juveniles living a full year with no food. Juvenile survival over time varied significantly among the mothers from the three study beaches, but we were unable to demonstrate a significant difference in the mean month of juvenile death. Juvenile size also varied significantly among mothers from the three study beaches, even when differences in female size by beach were accounted for. Adult female feeding treatments had no effect on the size of juveniles in the second broods. The patterns of juvenile performance mirrored those seen in the first year regardless of feeding treatment. The beach that a female came from seemed to have a stronger effect than a year of diet treatment. When looking at multiple generations of carryover in L. aequalis, it seems that genetic legacies, and possibly full female feeding history, have a greater effect on juvenile quality than a single year of maternal feeding.  2010 Elsevier B.V.

These changes in offspring phenotype represent examples of maternal effects and are thought to adjust offspring development to the posthatching environment. When studying the functional consequences of yolk hormones it is, therefore, crucial to manipulate the yolk androgen concentrations as well as the environmental conditions under which the study is performed. However, so far context-dependent effects of maternal yolk hormones have not sufficiently been taken into account, which might contribute to the current level of inconsistency in yolk androgen-mediated effects. We experimentally elevated the yolk testosterone concentrations and manipulated the sibling size hierarchy. We focused on the effects of yolk testosterone on growth and monitored begging behavior and parental feeding preferences in search of the underlying mechanisms of changes in growth. Experimental changes in the yolk testosterone concentrations significantly affected offspring phenotype. However, elevated yolk testosterone concentrations only improved the growth of chicks that were at a competitive disadvantage, whereas it benefited all chicks when placed in staged competition for food as juvenile. This emphasizes the compensatory role of yolk androgens in the context of hatching asynchrony and its context dependency. Enhanced growth did not coincide with intensified begging. Neither males nor females preferentially fed chicks hatching from eggs with elevated yolk testosterone concentrations. Enhanced growth rather resulted from yolk testosterone induced changes in physiology, of which the detailed mechanisms are yet unknown.  2010 The Author."

In birds, egg mass and laying/hatching order are the main determinants of offspring viability, but these effects can act differently on each sex. In a previous study, relatively large last-laid (c-)eggs of yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis) were more likely to carry a female embryo. This suggests compensatory allocation of maternal resources to daughters from c-eggs, which suffer reduced viability. In the present study, we supplemented yellow-legged gulls with food during the laying period to experimentally test whether their nutritional conditions were responsible for the observed covariation between c-egg sex and mass. As predicted, food supplementation enhanced female c-eggs' mass more than that of male c-eggs. Thus, this experiment indicates that mothers strategically allocated their resources to c-eggs, possibly in order to compensate for the larger susceptibility of daughters to hatching (and laying) order. The results also suggested that mothers decided on resource allocation depending on the sex of already ovulated c-eggs, rather than ovulating ova of either sex depending on food availability.  2009 The Royal Society."

There is also some evidence that females adjust their investment in offspring depending on the sex of the embryo during egg formation. Differential maternal investment to the eggs depending on their sex is usually interpreted as an adaptive strategy, by which females can increase competitive abilities of the smaller sex, or preferentially invest towards the sex with the potentially higher fitness returns. Here, we studied variation in egg size in relation to embryo sex and laying order in the European Blackbird Turdus merula. We found male and female eggs to differ in size, with larger eggs containing male embryos, as well as a significant interaction between embryo sex and laying order. This interaction resulted from the fact that egg size increased with the laying sequence among eggs bearing females but did not change with laying order among eggs bearing males. There was no relationship between offspring sex and the laying sequence within a clutch. We suggest that sexual dimorphism in egg size recorded in the European Blackbird may reflect favouritism of the sex which may give higher fitness returns.  2010 Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V."

Lysozyme concentration increased along the laying sequence, while avidin concentration decreased. Both antimicrobials declined during the season. In addition, avidin concentration declined from first- to last-laid male eggs, whereas the opposite was true among the female eggs. We also analysed chick body mass and size and immune response, in relation to albumen antimicrobial levels in their original egg while controlling for potential covariation between egg quality and rearing conditions by cross-fostering eggs between nests. Tarsus length decreased with avidin concentration, particularly early in the season. Avidin concentration negatively predicted tarsus length of chicks and the phytohaemagglutinin response of females, but not males. However, chick phenotype did not covary with lysozyme albumen concentration. This is the first study where maternal effects mediated by albumen antimicrobials are investigated in relation to both sex and egg features in any wild bird species. Whether the observed patterns of variation in antimicrobial concentration are the by-product of maternal physiological constraints, or reflect adaptive allocation strategies, cannot be ascertained. The covariation between chick cell-mediated immunity and albumen avidin concentration might be causal, according to the documented effects of albumen proteins on immunity in other species.

We use an orthogonal experimental design in which we increase plasma corticosterone concentration (vs. control) in placentotrophic gravid female spotted skinks (Niveoscincus ocellatus) and their offspring. We hypothesize that high concentrations of maternal corticosterone allow offspring phenotype to be pre-programmed to better cope with high concentrations of corticosterone after birth and, consequently, offspring would not suffer from its deleterious effects. We use growth as a measure of performance as corticosterone typically affects growth in reptiles. High concentrations of maternal corticosterone had significant effects on offspring body condition at birth which could have resulted from corticosterone passing through the complex placenta and/or from the indirect effects of corticosterone on maternal body condition. There was no indication of maternal pre-programming to high concentrations of corticosterone postpartum: growth rate of offspring placed in the same treatment (corticosterone vs. control) than their mother was not different to growth rate of offspring placed in a different treatment than their mother. Maternal pre-programming to corticosterone may not have been selected for in this species either because maternal chronic stress is not a reliable predictor of offspring chronic stress or because maternal pre-programming does not outweigh the costs of having reduced sensitivity to the hormone, resulting in slower, less appropriate reactions in stressful conditions. This study further demonstrates the highly versatile and context-dependent nature of maternal effects and the trade-offs between costs and benefits of maternal pre-programming.  2009 The Authors.

Longitudinal observations on the blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii) revealed a quadratic effect of female age on fledgling production and cohort differences in rate of reproductive decline. By swapping clutches between females of different ages, we tested whether reproductive senescence is due to decline in egg quality or capacity to care. As laying mothers aged, egg size, ulna length of 5-day-old chicks, and ulna growth of second chicks up to age 30 days declined, and as rearing mothers aged, ulna growth and cellular mediated immune response of second chicks diminished. Oddly, senescent females (>11 years) produced more fledglings when rearing offspring of middle-aged females (8-11 years) than when rearing offspring of senescent or young females. Thus, senescence reduced egg quality and rearing capacities, and reproductive success of senescent mothers depended on prenatal effects associated with the age of the laying mother. Reproductive senescence of boobies may involve constraints on resources allocated to reproduction as well as adaptive adjustment of provision and care according to offspring value, implying that negative effects of senescence on offspring survival can be ameliorated by plasticity in postlaying or postnatal care.  2010 by The University of Chicago."

They have been shown to influence a wide array of offspring traits, both early in life and in adulthood. One important offspring trait that is under the influence of maternal androgens is the immune system. In birds, a growing number of studies show that yolk androgens modulate immune function during the chick stage. However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding long-term effects of prenatal androgens on offspring immunity. In this study, we therefore investigated the influence of prenatal testosterone (T) on several measures of immunity in fledgling and adult zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Cell-mediated immune response (towards phytohaemagglutinin, PHA) of fledglings hatching from control eggs was negatively related to brood size, whereas there was no such association for fledglings hatching from eggs with experimentally elevated T levels (T fledglings). Male control fledglings showed reduced mass gain compared to female control fledglings within 24 h after the PHA injection. This pattern was reversed in T fledglings. Total antibody levels in fledglings were not affected by egg treatment. Neither cell-mediated immunity nor total antibody levels in sexually mature zebra finches were influenced by egg treatment. However, there was an immuno-enhancing effect of elevated egg T on both primary and secondary humoral immune responses toward diphtheria and tetanus antigens in ca 5 and 7 month old zebra finches. In addition, the covariation between different immune components differed between T and control offspring, suggesting that egg treatment may have altered the potential trade-offs between different parts of the immune system. Our results suggest that prenatal androgens could be an important factor contributing to individual variation in immune function even in adulthood.  Springer-Verlag 2009."

In these groups, embryonic development is characterized by (1) elevated progesterone concentrations, (2) 5 reduction being the primary metabolic pathway of progesterone, (3) the presence of xenobiotic-sensing nuclear receptors that can bind 5 metabolites of progesterone, and (4) increased expression of a suite of enzymes responsible for the metabolism of multiple steroids.

We found a strong seasonal decline in both egg and clutch size. Egg size increased with clutch size.

Chicks hatched from nests with higher mean egg volume had higher early body condition. We also compared individual females between different study years and found that individual body condition showed a significant repeatability between years, whereas hatching date did not. While female aging did not systematically affect hatching date, females produced clutches that hatched earlier in years of higher body condition. We could thus show for the first time that the frequently reported negative relationship between female condition and hatching date also holds true on an individual basis.

Expression and activity profiles of cyp19 and srd5beta were first established during Silurana (Xenopus) tropicalis embryogenesis from Nieuwkoop-Faber (NF) stage 2 (2-cell stage; 1 h post-fertilization) to NF stage 46 (beginning of feeding; 72 h post-fertilization). Exposures to fadrozole (an aromatase inhibitor; 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 M) and finasteride (a putative 5-reductase inhibitor; 25, 50 and 100 M) were designed to assess the consequences of inhibiting these enzymes on gene expression in early amphibian larval development. Exposed embryos showed changes in both enzyme activities and sex steroid- and thyroid hormone-related gene expression. Fadrozole treatment inhibited cyp19 activity and increased androgen receptor and thyroid hormone receptor ( and ) mRNAs. Finasteride treatment inhibited srd5beta (activity and mRNA), decreased cyp19 mRNA and activity levels and increased estrogen receptor  mRNA.

It has been proposed that steroid concentrations experienced in utero could be estimated from adults by measuring their second-to-fourth digit length ratio (2D:4D). However, there is still little direct evidence that intra-uterine steroid levels affect individual 2D:4D. We examined whether maternal pre-pregnancy testosterone and corticosterone levels (as estimates of intra-uterine testosterone and corticosterone exposure) affected the 2D:4D of pups in non-domesticated field voles (Microtus agrestis), measured by X-rays at the age of weaning (21 days). Furthermore, for the first time in a non-human species, we studied whether testosterone and corticosterone levels correlated with 2D:4D in adult females. We found that the maternal pre-pregnancy level of testosterone was not associated with offspring 2D:4D in either the left or the right paw. Instead, maternal pre-pregnancy corticosterone level was positively correlated with offspring 2D:4D in the right paw, but unrelated to 2D:4D in the left paw. In addition, the 2D:4D of adult females was not associated with either their circulating testosterone or corticosterone levels. Our results suggest that in field voles maternally administered testosterone is not a major determinant of offspring 2D:4D, whereas maternal stress appears to account for some of the variation in the 2D:4D of their offspring.  2009 Elsevier Inc.

Viviparity and TSD was regarded unlikely on theoretical grounds as viviparity allows for high stable developmental temperatures through maternal basking. However, pregnant squamates of many species choose different body temperatures from non-pregnant females and males, and we now know that differential temperature selection by viviparous species with TSD allows for the production of sons or daughters. Three species of squamate reptiles (all are skinks) are now know to exhibit TSD. The physiological mechanism by which viviparous reptiles control the sex of their offspring is not understood, but exposure to different operational sex ratios in the adult population is a factor in some species. The functional role of sex steroid hormones in egg yolk and how the hormones are manipulated in utero is still an area requiring detailed investigation. Fast maturing squamate reptiles provide an excellent, but as yet underutilized, model system for studying the adaptive significance of TSD, and the occurrence of TSD in viviparous species requires substantially more work on a phylogenetically diverse range of species.

In the present study, we compared various egg characteristics of a brood parasite, the common cuckoo Cuculus canorus, and its frequent host, the great reed warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus. As maternally-derived testosterone is known to enhance growth rate of embryos and hatchlings, cuckoo eggs are expected to contain higher concentration of testosterone than host eggs. In addition, we expected higher concentration of antioxidants in cuckoo eggs to protect embryos from oxidative stress associated with accelerated growth. Our results showed that cuckoo eggs had thicker shells and higher pore density than great reed warbler eggs. Yolk was significantly heavier in cuckoo eggs and contained higher concentrations of carotenoids and vitamin E, however, yolk androgen and immunoglobulin concentrations were lower in cuckoo eggs as compared to great reed warbler eggs. We also examined whether eggshell colour was associated to egg quality, and detected a positive association between blue-green chroma and yolk antioxidant concentration in both species, suggesting that eggshell colour reflects the antioxidant investment of the female into the eggs. Our results suggest that cuckoo females increase the size, growth rate and competitive ability of their young by providing them with more nutrients and more dietary antioxidants for embryonic development, and not through elevated yolk testosterone or antibody levels. In addition, increased porosity of cuckoo eggshells may allow embryos to develop more rapidly because of a greater capacity of gas exchange.  2010 The Authors."

We investigated the sex-specific mortality and body condition in relation to brood sex composition in nestlings of the black-billed magpie Pica pica. Neither significantly sex-biased production at hatching nor overall sex-biased mortality during the nestling period was found. Sex-specific mortality as a function of brood sex composition, however, differed between female and male nestlings. We found higher mortality for females in male-biased broods and higher mortality for males in female-biased broods, a phenomenon that we call 'rarer-sex disadvantage'. As a result, fledging sex ratios became more biased in the direction of bias at hatching, a phenomenon that cannot be readily explained by previous hypotheses for sex-specific mortality. Two temporal variables, fledging date and laying date, were also correlated with sex-specific mortality: female nestlings in earlier broods experienced higher mortality than male nestlings whereas male nestlings in later broods experienced higher mortality. We suggest that this unusual pattern of mortality may be explained by adaptive adjustments of brood sex composition by parents, either through the effects of a slight sex difference in offspring dispersal patterns on parental fitness, or owing to sex differences as regards the benefits of early fledging.  2010 The Authors."

They offer outstanding opportunities to understand the evolutionary transitions between modes of sex determination. In this review, we argue that sex allocation theory is fundamental for understanding the selective causes of such shifts. Whether selection for biased sex allocation actually results in evolutionary shifts in sex determination depends on the overall strength, direction and consistency of selection and to what extent existing reproductive systems can establish novel links between factors causing sex-specific fitness and mechanisms of sex determination. Perhaps one of the most exciting advances in recent years has been the phylogenetically diverse range in reptile taxa that form the basis of research on the evolution of sex determination. The traditional use of long-lived oviparous species (especially turtles and crocodiles) is now expanded to include a range of short-lived taxa that exhibit both genetic sex determination and environment-/temperature- dependent sex determination (particularly agamid lizards), as well as a greater emphasis on viviparous species. If selection on differential sex allocation is a key selective pressure for the evolution of sex-determining mechanisms, these taxa will provide considerable insights into the integrated fields of sex allocation biology and sex determination.

We test the effect of parental investment by males and females in the color polymorphic Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae), a species with mutual mate choice and high fitness costs when breeding with incompatible partners. Using a within-individual experimental design, in which both males and females were forced to breed with mates of the same (matched) and different (mixed) color morph, we show that females, but not males, increased their provisioning effort when breeding with compatible mates. By crossfostering offspring within and between matched and mixed pairs, we also found that foster offspring reared by matched pairs, with increased female provisioning, were healthier, grew and developed faster, and fledged earlier than offspring reared by mixed pairs. Furthermore, due to the experimental design, these effects were directly mediated by differential investment by females and not by male compensation. Thus, our results provide support for maternal (but not paternal) effects in response to mate quality."

Earlier hatching also led to an earlier onset of reproduction. Overall, increased survival probability for large hatchlings and a positive effect of clutch size on recruitment suggest consistent directional selection on both egg size and clutch size within and across years.

This is crucial for longlived species, where increased parental effort in current reproduction profoundly affects future reproduction. Indication of reproductive value or willingness to invest in reproduction may promote matching responses by mates, thus reducing the conflict over care. In birds with biparental care, blue-green eggshell color may function as a signal of reproductive value that affects parental effort, as predicted by the signaling hypothesis of blue-green eggshell coloration. However, this hypothesis has not been explored during incubation, when the potential stimulus of egg color is present, and has been little studied in longlived birds. We experimentally studied if egg color affected incubation patterns in the blue-footed booby, a longlived species with biparental care and blue eggs. We exchanged fresh eggs between nests of the same laying date and recorded parental incubation effort on the following 4 days. Although egg color did not affect male effort, original eggshell color was correlated with pair matching in incubation. Exchanged eggshell color did not affect incubation patterns. This suggests that biliverdin-based egg coloration reflects female quality features that are associated with pair incubation effort or that blue-footed boobies mate assortatively high-quality pairs incubating more colorful clutches. An intriguing possibility is that egg coloration facilitates an equal sharing of incubation, the signal being functional only during a short period close to laying. Results also suggest that indication of reproductive value reduces the conflict over care.  2009 Springer-Verlag."

The birds were housed in a common-garden environment in captivity until full independence, after which their behaviour was tested. We found that androgen-treated males were more likely than control males to explore a novel environment and showed higher activity in the presence of a novel object. In response to a simulated predator attack, androgen-treated males mainly showed freezing behaviour, while control males showed escape behaviour. Females from the androgen treatment and control group showed no differences in these behaviours. Androgen treatment did not affect neophobia (latency to approach the novel object) or dominance behaviour in either sex. Behaviour in the novel environment and towards a novel object was repeatable, but behaviours in the different experiments were mostly not inter-correlated. These results indicate that yolk androgens have various long-lasting effects on behaviour, especially in males, but that they do not induce a distinct behavioural syndrome. As behaviour is strongly linked with fitness, our results suggest that yolk androgens may play a role in determining fitness, and thus play a potentially adaptive role.  2009 Elsevier Inc.

A small blood sample was taken from each nestling on day 11 post-hatch and used to quantify levels of baseline corticosterone. The proportion of time spent by female breeders at a considerable distance from the nest was positively related to nestling corticosterone levels. Nestling corticosterone was also negatively related to parental provisioning rate, although this effect seemed to be secondary to the effect of the female's time away from the nest.

Experimental females were reared under hypodynamia, a model situation for restraint stress, from day 3 to 63 days of age. For yolk hormone analysis, four largest follicles of ovarian hierarchy (F1-F4), eggs present in the oviduct and eggs laid on the day before were collected. In chronically stressed birds, yolk testosterone concentrations decreased from F2 onwards, while yolk corticosterone content was increased from the beginning to the end of egg formation. The follicular profile of hormones suggested testosterone transfer into the yolk directly from granulosa and theca cells, with the highest accumulation during a period 48-72 h before laying the egg. Yolk corticosterone was accumulated from maternal plasma preferentially in early stages of follicular development under control conditions and also in last stages of egg formation under stress conditions. These specific patterns of hormone deposition indicate periods when stimuli experienced by female can substantially modify hormonal content of eggs. Lower testosterone and increased corticosterone yolk concentrations in stressed quail may represent signals mediating information about adverse environmental conditions from the mother to progeny.  2009 Elsevier Inc.

Cockatiels are a long-lived member of the Psittaciformes. Because asynchronous hatching may reduce sibling competition and allow for extended development periods in long-lived birds, we predicted that female cockatiels would allocate maternal resources in a way that would reinforce the brood size hierarchy. Significant within-clutch differences in egg size and steroid concentrations were observed. Eggs at the end of the laying sequence were smaller and had significantly smaller yolks than eggs early in the laying order. Fifth-laid eggs, as well as first-laid eggs, contained significantly lower concentrations of testosterone than eggs in other positions of the laying sequence. No differences in yolk androstenedione concentration were observed. Yolk corticosterone concentrations increased linearly with laying order.

However, the potential impact of this phenomenon on the physiology of animals is not yet broadly appreciated, in part because the phenomenon of epigenetics is not typically part of the design of physiological investigations. Still enigmatic and somewhat ill defined is the relationship between the overarching concept of epigenetics and interesting transgenerational phenomena (e.g. 'maternal/parental effects') that alter the physiological phenotype of subsequent generations. The lingering effect on subsequent generations of an initial environmental disturbance in parent animals can be profound, with genes continuing to be variously silenced or expressed without an associated change in gene sequence for many generations. Known epigenetic mechanisms involved in this phenomenon include chromatin remodeling (DNA methylation and histone modification), RNA-mediated modifications (non-coding RNA and microRNA), as well as other less well studied mechanisms such as self-sustaining loops and structural inheritance. In this review we: (1) discuss how the concepts of epigenetics and maternal effects both overlap with, and are distinct from, each other; (2) analyze examples of existing animal physiological studies based on these concepts; and (3) offer a construct by which to integrate these concepts into the design of future investigations in animal physiology."

In addition, maternal hormones have been suggested as a mechanism to skew brood sex ratio. This study uses one of the world's most extreme SSD species, the brown songlark Cinclorhamphus cruralis, to investigate (1) sex-specific differences of androgens in yolk and chick plasma and (2) the relationship between androgens and sex ratio bias. The study reveals no indication of sex-specific maternal allocation, but a modest sex effect during the later stages of incubation when the embryo starts to produce its own androgens. Moreover, there was a strong seasonal sex ratio bias: female-biased early and male-biased later in the season, but yolk testosterone (T) did not show a seasonal trend. Taken together these results suggest that if androgens, from any source, have a significant role in development of SSD in this species it is most likely via sex-specific sensitivity or synthesis rather than differential maternal transfer to the egg.  2009 Elsevier Inc.

We studied the natural variation of haematological and plasma biochemistry parameters (namely leucocyte, lymphocyte and heterophil counts, H/L ratio and plasma concentrations of proteins, triglycerides and carotenoids) in relation to the different measures of parental investment in males and females in the Upland goose (Chloephaga picta leucoptera), a socially monogamous species. We found no sex differences in haematological and most plasma biochemistry parameters, but a relation to different aspects of parental investment in breeding male and female Upland geese. H/L ratios were related to body condition and capture date in males while leucocyte counts, plasma protein and plasma carotenoid concentrations varied with clutch measures and hatching date in females. Higher H/L ratios of males in a low body condition and later in the year may reflect stress associated with the investment into the establishment and defence of the breeding territory. Females with higher clutch volumes had lower total leucocyte and lymphocyte numbers and higher levels of plasma protein. Earlier hatching dates were associated with lower numbers of all leucocyte types and higher values of plasma carotenoid concentrations. This indicates that differences in health state are reflected in reproductive performance in female Upland geese. We also found sexual differences in the repeatability of haematological and plasma biochemistry parameters between years and therefore suggest that their potential as a measure of individual quality differs between male and female Upland geese. Finally, numbers of leucocyte counts and plasma triglyceride concentrations of pair partners were significantly related. No study so far investigated these parameters in pair partners and we discuss possible reasons for our finding.  2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

In biparental systems, resolution of this trade-off may depend on the extent to which males mitigate the cost of female aggression. Using a population of tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) in which intrasexual aggression has been shown to be beneficial to females in acquiring a nesting cavity, but costly in terms of offspring quality, I asked if the cost of female aggression is offset by her partner. First, I determined if pairs mate disassortatively by aggressiveness and whether the degree of dissimilarity of aggressiveness correlates with parameters of reproductive success. I then experimentally handicapped males to test whether female aggressiveness becomes more costly when males provision young less. I found no evidence of disassortative mating, although pairs differing more in aggressiveness laid more and larger eggs. When male provisioning was reduced, offspring were no worse in quality, but nestling mortality increased. Aggressive behavior was only associated with a fitness cost in control nests. Therefore, males may mitigate the cost of aggression for their female partners indirectly, not by compensating for poor parenting by aggressive females, but instead by females investing more heavily in reproduction when mated to a male that is more different from her own phenotype. To the extent this differential allocation outweighs the cost of aggressiveness, male phenotype may play a key role in understanding the selective pressures shaping the evolution of aggressive behavior in females."

In species with altricial young, these signals may also predict the level of parental care an individual is expected to provide to shared offspring. In this study, we tested three hypotheses that traditionally relate sexually dimorphic traits to parental care in two populations of North American barn swallows Hirundo rustica erythrogaster. The good parent hypothesis predicts a positive relationship between an individual's ornamentation and his or her care whereas the differential allocation (more care given by individuals when paired to high quality mates) and reproductive compensation (more care given by individuals when paired to low quality mates) hypotheses predict that an individual's level of parental investment is relative to the quality of their mate. Male and female North American barn swallows have colorful ventral feathers and elongated tail streamers, but there is evidence that ventral color, not tail streamer length, predicts measures of seasonal reproductive success. Accounting for the positive correlation between within-pair feeding rates and other potentially confounding variables in all of our models, we found no support for the good parent hypothesis because in both males and females, traits shown to be under sexual selection did not predict feeding rates in either sex. However, our data reveal that male coloration, and not streamer length, predicted a female's provisioning rate to shared offspring (females fed more when paired with darker individuals) in two separate populations, supporting the differential allocation, but not the reproductive compensation hypothesis. Because genetic traits have also been shown to affect parental investment, we evaluated this variable as well and found that a male's paternity did not have significant effects on either male or female feeding rates. Overall, our results suggest that females do not pair with darker males in order to gain direct benefits in terms of his expected levels of parental care to shared offspring, but do themselves invest greater levels of care when paired to darker males. Further, our results are consistent with previous studies which suggest that ventral feather color, not streamer length, is a target of sexual selection in North American populations of barn swallow because females invested more in their offspring when paired to darker mates.  2010 The Authors.

To understand the direct fitness consequences of breeding time requires distinguishing between these two possibilities. We used egg removal and re-laying experiments to evaluate how date and parental quality affect breeding success in a zooplanktivorous seabird, Cassin's Auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus). Egg laying began at the same time in all 5 years of study at Triangle Island, British Columbia, but, compared with a cold-water year, the population laid later and less synchronously in 4 warm-water years in which prey populations peaked earlier. As a result, Cassin's Auklets were less successful in years in which they laid later. Within seasons, early-laying females whose breeding attempt we delayed did not follow the population-wide seasonal declines in hatching success. This indicates a strong role for parental quality at the egg stage, probably because early, high-quality birds maintained more constant incubation. By contrast, the experimental females followed the population-wide seasonal declines in nestling survival and fledging mass. This indicates a strong role for date at the offspring-provisioning stage, which accords well with a previous study that found that success while raising nestlings is largely determined by the degree of temporal (mis)matching with the copepod Neocalanus cristatus. Our results offer novel insight into the causes of seasonal declines in avian breeding success, indicating that date and parental effects can be differentially involved, depending on the stage of breeding.

We test the hypothesis that phenotypic variation created under natural incubation conditions will differ from that created under constant laboratory conditions in a reptile species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta). Using a split clutch design, we demonstrate that offspring morphology, behavior, and sex differed between hatchlings incubated in the field and those from the laboratory, but immune response did not. The interactions between different phenotypic parameters will ultimately determine how natural selection acts upon offspring, and consequently our data suggest that offspring developing under these differing conditions should have different fitnesses. The relationship between offspring sex and phenotype serves as the theoretical foundation on which most investigations into the evolution of TSD are built. Thus, it may be necessary to use natural incubation conditions to accurately examine how offspring sex relates to other phenotypic parameters if we are to understand the evolution of this sex determining mechanism.  2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Before their utilization carotenoids must be acquired through diet and mobilized for specific uses. The relationships between carotenoid-based coloration, circulating carotenoids and body condition have been well studied in adult birds, but little is known in nestlings. Here, we investigated variations in carotenoid-based coloration in a raptor nestling, the Montagu's harrier (Circus pygargus), both in captivity and in natural conditions, and within a vole (poor-carotenoid source and cyclic prey) specialist population. We studied these variations according to nestling age and sex, and possible limitations in carotenoid availability by comparing years of contrasted prey abundance and using carotenoid supplementation experiments. Captive nestlings, fed only with mice, were strongly carotenoid limited. Wild nestlings were also carotenoid limited, especially in a year of high vole abundance. Nestlings were in better condition but less colored during a peak vole abundance year than during a low vole abundance year, when harriers targeted more alternative preys (birds, insects). Thus, variation in vole abundance resulted in a de-coupling of body condition and carotenoid-based coloration in this population. This suggested that the positive relation between the body condition and carotenoid-based traits, typically found in adult birds, could be restricted to adults or nestlings of species that feed on carotenoid-rich food. Our results should stimulate more work on the functions and mechanisms of carotenoid-based traits in nestlings, which deserve more attention and most likely differ from those of adult birds.

Central to communication research is gaining an understanding of the information content of signals and the ecological, social and physiological factors that influence their format. It is clear that individuals which benefit from social exchange can critically influence what information is transmitted, how it is transmitted and whether it is scrambled to prevent eavesdropping. Less clear is how the physical channels through which signals are emitted and received might influence the extent to which they are prone to errors, dishonesty and manipulation. Here we show how sensory systems, perceptual physiology, cognitive decision rules and evolutionary trajectories produce the broad range of signalling modalities and contents that we see in nature. Our overview suggests that experimental evidence on the meaning, honesty and selective benefits of communication for signallers and receivers across invertebrates and vertebrates can provide a taxonomically broad but conceptually similar set of examples. This is not surprising, since studies across diverse lineages have demonstrated that the mechanism and function of communication systems both critically shape social behaviour and are being shaped by sociality. In particular, functional investigations of the sensory systems of vocal communication in songbirds, visual signals in trap-building predators, and chemical signalling in arthropods, have established clear examples of the limits to perception and discrimination of signal design.

Because most avian species maintain atrophied reproductive organs when not active, reproduction in birds requires major tissue remodeling in preparation for breeding. Females undergo rapid (days) recrudescence and regression of their reproductive organs at each breeding attempt, while males grow their organs ahead of time at a much slower rate (weeks) and may maintain them at maximal size throughout the breeding season. Reproduction is associated with significant metabolic costs. Egg production leads to a 22%-27% increase in resting metabolic rate (RMR) over non-reproductive values. This is partly due to the activity of the oviduct, an organ that may allow females to adjust reproductive investment by modulating egg size and quality. In males, gonadal recrudescence may lead to a 30% increase in RMR, but the data are inconsistent and general conclusions regarding energetic costs of reproduction in males will require more research. Recent studies on captive female zebra finches describe the impacts of these costs on daily energy budgets and highlight the strategies used by birds to maintain their investment in reproduction when energy is limited. Whenever possible, birds use behavioral flexibility as a first means of saving energy. Decreasing locomotor activity saves energy during challenges such as egg production or exposure to cold temperatures and is an efficient way to buffer variation in individual daily energy budgets. However, when behavioral flexibility is not possible, birds must rely on flexibility at the physiological level to meet energy demands. In zebra finches breeding in the cold, this results in a reduced pace of laying, likely due to down-regulation of both reproductive and non-reproductive function, allowing females to defend minimal egg size and maintain reproductive success. More research involving a range of species in captive and free-living conditions is needed to determine how phenotypic flexibility during tissue remodeling and early reproductive investment translates to natural conditions and affects fitness.  2010 Current Zoology."

We operationally define a mammalian society as complex if its social structure includes social coalitions, social alliances or social queues  well known from primates, elephants and cetaceans but also present in, for instance, some carnivores, bats, rodents and ungulates. We consider how social structure can lead to a disparity in the benefits and costs acquired by group members, and how this leads to conflicts of interest between them. We detail the social and reproductive tactics that individuals use when conflicts arise, and consider the fitness consequences associated with these tactics. We illustrate most key points using observational studies of free-ranging mammals, because experimental studies are rare, and we draw examples from a broad range of social systems and mammalian orders. Introduction How do complex societies emerge from a life in groups? Living in groups inevitably results in conflicts of interest between group members. The specific forms of these conflicts are likely to affect the strategies to cope with them. Not only will the details of these strategies shape the social relationships we can observe, they may be the consequences of evolutionary processes, and are likely to have resulted in the social complexity described for many mammalian societies.

Organisms able to acclimate to human-altered environments should have a selective advantage over those unable to do so. Over the past two decades, bats have increasingly begun to roost and raise offspring in spaces beneath pre-cast concrete bridges. Few studies have examined the health or fitness of individuals living in these anthropogenic sites. In the present study, we examined birth size and postnatal growth, as surrogates of reproductive success, in Brazilian free-tailed bat pups born at a natural and a human-made roost. Based on putative stress-related conditions (noise from vehicular traffic, chemical pollutants and a modified social environment) present at bridges, we predicted that bats at these sites would have reduced reproductive success. Contrary to our prediction, pups born at a bridge site were on average heavier and larger at birth and grew faster than those born at a cave site. Also, both birth size and growth rates of pups differ between years. We attribute observed differences to a combination of roost-related conditions (i.e. roost temperature and proximity to foraging areas), climate and maternal effects with larger mothers raising larger pups. Thus, some bridge roosts, at least in the short term, are suitable, and in some cases may provide better conditions, for raising young bat pups than cave roosts.  2009 The Zoological Society of London."

In birds, the presence of eggs stimulates incubation and, subsequently, the cessation of egg production. We propose that the same mechanism also regulates female motivation to engage in EPCs. To test this idea, we simulated the earlier onset of laying in blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), by adding model eggs to nests before natural laying commenced. Most females accepted these eggs, covering them with nest material in the natural way. As predicted, these broods hatched more asynchronously than control broods, revealing an earlier onset of incubation, and were less likely to contain extrapair offspring (EPO) suggesting that stimulation from eggs also inhibits motivation to seek EPCs. Egg stimulation is thought to cause cessation of laying a fixed number of days before clutch completion, after a certain hormonal threshold is exceeded. Similarly, a lower threshold may inhibit engagement in EPCs relative to clutch completion, explaining the proportional increase in EPO toward the extremes of clutch size, which we also observed, and would be consistent with a fertility or compatibility insurance function for EPCs. Our findings may represent the best experimental evidence for female-mediated effects on the timing of EPCs and suggest how EPP may be integrated within the regulatory mechanism of avian reproduction."

Ecological theory predicts that these fast-growing genotypes are, in the absence of trade-offs with fast growth, better competitors than low-latitude conspecifics. While knowledge on key ecological traits along latitudinal clines is important for understanding how these clines are maintained, the relative competitive ability of high latitude individuals against low latitude conspecifics has not been tested. Growth and development rates of the common frog Rana temporaria increase along the latitudinal gradient across Scandinavia. Here we investigated larval competition over food resources within and between two R. temporaria populations originating from southern and northern Sweden in an outdoor common garden experiment. We used a factorial design, where southern and northern tadpoles were reared either as single populations or as mixes of the two populations at two densities and predator treatments (absence and non-lethal presence of Aeshna dragonfly larvae). Tadpoles from the high latitude population grew and developed faster and in the beginning of the experiment they hid less and were more active than tadpoles from the low latitude population. When raised together with high latitude tadpoles the southern tadpoles had a longer larval period, however, the response of high latitude tadpoles to the competition by low latitude tadpoles did not differ from their response to intra-population competition. This result was not significantly affected by density or predator treatments. Our results support the hypothesis that high latitude populations are better competitors than their low latitude conspecifics, and suggest that in R. temporaria fast growth and development trade off with other fitness components along the latitudinal gradient across Scandinavia.

In general, this body of work follows the traditional definition that parental investment (in the current offspring) decreases that individual's ability to invest in future reproduction (Trivers 1972). However, examination of the empirical evidence shows that assuming a trade-off between parental and mating effort is not always appropriate. This overemphasis on a trade-off between mating and parental effort has arisen in part because of an oversimplification of female reproductive strategies, a failure to consider interactions between the sexes, and a tendency to consider behaviours as unifunctional, thereby ignoring the more complex relationship between mating and parental effort in many species. Here, we first examine the empirical evidence for trade-offs between mating and parental effort in males and females to ask when trade-offs occur and what pattern they take. By highlighting a number of exemplar species, we then explore how the presence or absence of trade-offs relates to mate choice and sexual selection in both sexes. Finally, we highlight the importance of considering individual variation, which has been particularly overlooked in examinations of female investment, and how preferences in one sex may influence the existence and our interpretation of apparent trade-offs in the other sex.  2009 Blackwell Verlag GmbH."

Moreover, we examined the infuence of temperature on three important egg components, i.e. the yolk carotenoids and the albumen lysozyme and avidin. In our experimental condition food was provided ad libitum, hence we were able to remove the possible indirect effects of temperature due to a concomitant effect of temperature on food availability. Temperature on the day immediately before laying (day-1) was positively related to total egg mass and albumen mass, and negatively related to shell mass. Yolk mass was positively related to temperature in the day farthest from laying (day-5). These fndings are in line with the predicted timing of the maturation of egg follicle, with yolk deposition preceding albumen and shell formation. Carotenoids and lysozyme concentration did not vary in relation to temperature, while avidin concentration was positively related to the temperature on day-1. Avidin is an albumen antibacterial substance, that could play a benefcial role during the embryonic development phases.

This integrative approach will allow the research community to continue making advances to provide functional and evolutionary explanations for the lability of biological traits found not only among reptiles but vertebrates in general. Moreover, because humans and reptiles share a common ancestor, and given the ease of using nonplacental vertebrates in experimental biology compared with mammalian embryos, painted turtles are also an emerging model system for biomedical research. For example, painted turtles have been studied to understand many biological responses to overwintering and anoxia, as potential sentinels for environmental xenobiotics, and as a model to decipher the ecology and evolution of sexual development and reproduction.

We present data on intralocus sexual conflict over immune defense in a natural population of free-ranging lizards (Uta stansburiana) and discuss the resolution of this conflict. Intralocus sexual conflict arises from correlational selection between immune defense and orange throat coloration in these lizards. Males with orange throats and high antibody responses had enhanced survival, but the same trait combination reduced female fitness. This sexual antagonism persisted across the life cycle and was concordant between the juvenile and adult life stages. The opposing selective pressure on males and females is ameliorated by a negative intersexual genetic correlation (rm,f = -0.86) for immune defense. Throat coloration was also genetically correlated with immune defense, but the sign of this genetic correlation differed between the sexes. This resulted in sex-specific signaling of immunological condition. We also found evidence for a sex-specific maternal effect on sons with potential to additionally reduce the gender load. These results have implications for signaling evolution, genetic integration between adaptive traits, sex allocation, and mutual mate choice for indirect fitness benefits.  2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution."

However, developmental effects on the neonate's future immunity are potentially costly and thus could limit yolk antibody deposition. The benefits to neonatal immunity must be balanced against costs, which may depend on neonate vulnerability to pathogens, developmental trajectories and the immunological strategies best suited to a species' pace of life. We measured yolk antibodies and life-history features of 23 species of small Neotropical birds and assessed the evidence for each of several hypotheses for life history and ecological effects on the evolution of yolk antibody levels. Developmental period and yolk antibodies are negatively related, which possibly reflect the importance of humoral immune priming through antigen exposure, and selection to avoid autoimmunity, in species with a slower pace of life. There is also a strong relationship between body size and yolk antibody concentration, suggesting that larger species are architecturally equipped to produce and transfer higher concentrations of antibodies. These results suggest that developmental effects of maternally derived antibodies, such as imprinting effects on B-cell diversity or autoimmune effects, are important and deserve more consideration in future research.  2009 The Royal Society."

We studied the effects of egg size variation on juvenile survival in a population of American coots (Fulica americana). We experimentally evaluated egg size variation at three levels: across the population, within natal nests, and within foster nests. Natal nests accounted for the most variation in population egg size. Within clutches, early-laid eggs were larger than later-laid eggs, with the exception of first-laid eggs, which were small. In the fostering experiment, posthatching survival was most strongly related to egg size relative to natal siblings and natal hatching order and less so to egg size within foster nests. These effects on survival were found even though young from natal nests were neither raised together nor raised by genetic parents. These results indicate that females allocate resources unequally among offspring such that offspring from larger, early-laid eggs have higher survival than offspring from smaller, laterlaid eggs, regardless of their size relative to foster siblings or to mean population egg size. These results suggest that egg size variation can be maintained through selection on maternal investment strategies and not on egg size per se.  2009 by The University of Chicago."

Experimentally increased T in adult female birds has been found to have both advantageous and detrimental effects on behaviour and fitness. In addition, T may also mediate maternal effects when it is deposited into the egg yolk, and variations in androgen concentration between eggs contribute to differences in offspring phenotype and fitness. In this study we examined the effects of experimentally elevated female T on reproductive success and yolk androgen deposition in the spotless starling. The administration of exogenous T in female spotless starlings before egg laying caused negative effects on reproductive performance: when compared to control females T-females laid fewer eggs and raised fewer chicks. We also found an effect of elevated female T on yolk androgen deposition: T-females laid eggs with greater amounts of yolk T than control females, whereas yolk androstenedione levels were not affected. Although some of these effects likely involved a direct interference of female T with female reproductive function, some of them could be due to effects operating in eggs through maladaptive high T levels.  2009 Elsevier B.V.

The length of egg incubation is also known to be shorter in eggs laid by high than low stress hens. 2. Here we investigated the interactive effects of quail stress line (low vs. high stress) with maternal corticosterone treatment (empty implant controls vs. corticosterone-implants) during egg formation on length of egg incubation. 3. Mean (SEM) length of egg incubation for high stress control eggs (397.300.4 h) was similarly shorter (by about 4.5 h) than that found for low stress control eggs (392.80.2 h). In addition, on average, the incubation length of eggs laid by corticosterone-implanted hens (392.90.5 h) was nearly 3 h shorter than that found for eggs laid by control hens (395.80.2 h) regardless of stress line. 4.

Our original contention that selection for exaggerated adrenocortical responsiveness is associated with a reduction in the length of egg incubation was supported. Because maternal stress-induced elevations of yolk B are known to occur, the present findings of further shortenings of the hatching times of eggs of corticosterone-treated hens of both stress lines are also important to the poultry industry because they warn producers that unless stress in hens during egg formation is minimised, abbreviated egg incubation periods may result beyond the effects that a hen's genetic predisposition to adrenocortical stress responsiveness has on the length of egg incubation.  2009 British Poultry Science Ltd."

This suggests that mothers should forego these costs to their offspring when the need for compensation for hatching asynchrony is low or when alternative compensatory strategies, e.g. in terms of increasing egg mass, are available. Here we show that in the south-temperate lesser double-collared sunbird Nectarinia chalybea, a species with hatching asynchrony but also with high survival of last-hatched chicks, mothers do not deposit resources differentially in terms of either yolk androgen concentration or egg mass across the laying sequence.

In this study, we tested several predictions regarding variation in immunocompetence and distribution of parasites within avian broods by combining parasite removal and carotenoid supplementation treatments in nests of mountain bluebirds Sialia currucoides. Last-hatched nestlings were less likely to invest carotenoids in an induced cell-mediated immune response, suggesting they may be more susceptible to parasites; however, parasite removal disproportionately benefited middle-ranked nestlings. This supports the hypothesis that some avian ectoparasites balance host resistance against nutritional benefits by preferentially parasitizing nestlings of intermediate quality and immunocompetence. We found no evidence that males positioned last in the hatching sequence were differentially affected by ectoparasites, and, contrary to some previous studies in other passerines, last-hatched nestlings in asynchronously hatching broods were not less immunocompetent than their nest mates. In fact, junior nestlings exhibited weaker immune responses than their siblings in more synchronously hatching broods, and we suggest this may reflect environment-dependent maternal effects that warrant further investigation. Overall, our results highlight the importance of understanding the feeding and host selection behaviour of ectoparasites, as well as the fitness consequences thereof, since many predictions related to within-brood distribution of parasites require that parasites are able to discern the relative quality of available hosts.  2009 Oikos."

Organism: Egernia whitii, a long-lived social reptile that exhibits within-litter variation in its timing of birth (i.e. birthing asynchrony). Methods: We measured offspring growth and survival in a natural population of E. whitii by following three cohorts of offspring from birth to their second year of life (the year before the onset of reproduction).

Here, we examine the underlying causes and selective consequences of individual variation in the temperament trait 'exploration behaviour in a novel environment' (EB, based on an 8-min assay) in a free-ranging population of a passerine bird, the great tit Parus major. 2.First, we conducted a quantitative genetic analysis on EB using a restricted maximum likelihood-based animal model with a long-term pedigree. Although repeatability was relatively high, EB was only moderately heritable and permanent environment (VPE) effects contributed as much to phenotypic variance as additive genetic effects. 3.We then asked whether heterogeneous selection acted on EB at various temporal and spatial scales. Using estimates of lifetime reproductive success, we found evidence of weak negative directional selection acting on EB amongst females which was driven by selection through recruitment, but not fecundity, in one of the four breeding years. There was no evidence of any selection on EB through survival. 4.Heterogeneous selection on EB within seasons was also observed amongst males through fecundity along two fine-scale environmental gradients - local breeding density and habitat quality; we are unaware of any previous equivalent demonstrations. 5.All of these analyses were repeated on a second measure of exploration behaviour (EB2, measured during a 2-min assay) to facilitate comparison with other studies. EB and EB2 were strongly correlated to one another at the genetic level, but were only moderately correlated at the phenotypic level and VPE was undetected in EB 2. Selection on EB2 was similar to that on EB; we conclude that both traits are broadly equivalent from an evolutionary perspective. 6.Our analyses suggest that to the extent that the temperament trait 'exploration behaviour' is subject to natural selection in this population, this selection is highly context dependent and most evident along two environmental gradients. Furthermore, the strong VPE effect detected suggests that understanding the causes and consequences of variation in this trait will require studies firmly embedded in an environmental context.  2009 British Ecological Society."

We investigate in colonial breeding black-headed gulls whether high concentrations of yolk androgens, such as those found in environments with high numbers of social interactions, facilitate aggressiveness and territorial behaviour of the chicks. Black-headed gulls are highly suitable for this, as the semi-precocial chicks defend the natal territory and food against intruders. We manipulated yolk androgen concentrations and investigated their role in both within-nest and between-nest aggression. We found that chicks hatching from androgen-treated eggs defended the natal territory more often than their nestmates fromcontrol eggs, without increasing sibling aggression.

Here, we present the first estimates of intrafemale repeatability across breeding seasons and estimates of heritability of hormonemediated maternal effects in a wild population of collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis). We found that maternal yolk testosterone (T) concentrations, yolk mass, and egg mass were moderately to highly repeatable within females across years, whereas intrafemale consistency of maternal yolk androstenedione (A4) deposition was low yet statistically significant. Furthermore, maternal yolk T transfer, yolk mass, and egg mass were significantly heritable, whereas yolk A4 transfer was not. These results strongly suggest that two major maternal yolk androgens are differentially regulated by genes and the environment.

In this particular context we tested the hypothesis that parental infestation by a haematophageous field ectoparasite, the sheep tick Ixodes ricinus, in a hole-breeding passerine bird, the great tit Parus major, ultimately leads to the reduction of nestling quality. Observational data of a long-term study show that 15 days after hatching, nestlings' body condition (body mass corrected for body size) was negatively associated with the tick load of the mother, while no association was found with tick load of the father. A field experiment was conducted to test if adult infestation by ticks leads to a reduction in offspring quality. The field experiment consisted of a two by two factorial design: neither, one or both parents were infested with a high tick load (12 nymphs) when nestlings were eight days old. Four days after manipulation of the parents, the effect of the treatment on nestlings' health was assessed by measuring haematological and biochemical parameters. Body condition of nestlings was monitored from three days after hatching, until seven days after tick manipulation of the parents. Although parental tick manipulation resulted in successful tick feeding, nestlings' health parameters were not affected. We therefore suggest that the negative association between nestling condition and parental tick load does not reflect a causal effect of parasites, but either reflects a common environmental factor affecting parental infestation levels and offspring condition, or reflects parental quality. We propose different explanations why this association is expressed in female parents only.  2009 Oikos."

In this landmark book, Stuart West synthesizes the vast literature on sex allocation, providing the conceptual framework the field has been lacking and demonstrating how sex-allocation studies can shed light on broader questions in evolutionary and behavioral biology. West clarifies fundamental misconceptions in the application of theory to empirical data. He examines the field's successes and failures, and describes the research areas where much important work is yet to be done. West reveals how a shared underlying theoretical framework unites findings of sex-ratio variation across a huge range of life forms, from malarial parasites and hermaphroditic worms to sex-changing fish and mammals. He shows how research on sex allocation has been central to many critical questions and controversies in evolutionary and behavioral biology, and he argues that sex-allocation research serves as a key testing ground for different theoretical approaches and can help resolve debates about social evolution, parent-offspring conflict, genomic conflict, and levels of selection. Certain to become the defining book on the subject for the next generation of researchers, Sex Allocation explains why the study of sex allocation provides an ideal model system for advancing our understanding of the constraints on adaptation among all living things in the natural world.  2009 by Princeton University Press.

Using Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), we found that effects of mating in the context predicting mating opportunity depend on female body condition and receptivity, while the outcome of unexpected mating depends on male behaviour. In particular, among females mated with the familiar male in the context predicting that he will appear, female condition positively affected the number of fertilized eggs and egg mass and more receptive females tended to produce more sons. Additionally, conditioned females laid heavier eggs for daughters than for sons. In contrast, in females that were mated unexpectedly and with a novel male, the number of fertilized eggs was highly dependent on male behaviour and was negatively related to maternal body condition. Egg mass was not related to body condition, and there were no indications of sex allocation. This is, to our knowledge, the first study demonstrating how female body condition and behaviour interact with the context of mating in shaping maternal reproductive investment.  2009 The Royal Society."

However, rather than routinely expecting adaptive variation within all species, the pattern and magnitude of yolk hormone deposition should theoretically relate to variation in life-histories. Here we present data on intra-clutch variation in yolk corticosterone in three species along a developmental continuum (European starling (Sturnus vulgaris): fully altricial; black guillemot (Cepphus grylle): semi-precocial; common eider (Somateria mollissima): fully precocial) to examine how and why variation in life-histories might relate to the evolution of variation in yolk steroids. Starlings and guillemots showed a significant increase in yolk corticosterone across the laying sequence; however, we found no pattern within eider clutches. Moreover, starlings showed the largest difference (94.6%) in yolk corticosterone between first- and last-laid eggs, whereas guillemots showed a moderate difference (58.9%). Despite these general species-specific patterns, individuals showed marked variation in the intra-clutch patterns of yolk corticosterone within each species indicating potential differences in intra-clutch flexibility among females. It is well documented that exposure to elevated yolk glucocorticoids reduces offspring quality at birth/hatching in many taxa and it has therefore been proposed that elevated yolk levels may modulate offspring competition and/or facilitate brood reduction under harsh conditions in birds. Our data suggests that intra-clutch variation in yolk corticosterone has the potential to act as an adaptive maternal effect in species where modulation of competition between nest-bound offspring would benefit mothers (starlings and guillemots). However, in precocial species where mothers would not benefit from a modulation of offspring quality, intra-clutch variation in yolk hormones may play little or no adaptive role. While future phylogenetically-controlled studies will be helpful in examining questions of adaptive mechanisms once more data on yolk corticosterone becomes available, our results nonetheless suggest that research on the evolutionary role of yolk hormones can benefit by a priori incorporating species-specific life-history-driven hypotheses.  2008 Elsevier Inc.

Egg size and maternally-derived steroid hormone concentrations present in yolk have been characterized for many species that lay small clutches or have altricial young, but little information is available for species that lay moderate to large clutches of precocial young. In this study, we recorded laying position, measured fresh egg mass and determined maternally-derived testosterone and estradiol concentrations present in yolks for whole clutches of free-living Canada geese Branta canadensis maxima to assess variation in maternal resources within clutches. We found that egg size varied non-linearly across the laying sequence such that first laid eggs were small, the largest eggs in the clutch occurred in the second and third positions, and size declined in eggs laid in subsequent positions. Concentration of testosterone in the yolk followed a pattern in which the first and second laid eggs have the highest concentrations within a clutch and declining concentrations in subsequently laid eggs. In contrast, maternally-derived yolk estradiol concentrations (measured in a subset of clutches) did not change across the laying sequence.  2009 J. Avian Biol."

The control of mother and offspring over hormone-mediated maternal effects is thought to play a key role in the outcome of parent-offspring conflict, but these control mechanisms have hardly been studied. We investigated the potential embryonic control by analysing the changes in distribution and metabolism of steroid hormones in the egg during the first 6 days of incubation using injections of radiolabelled testosterone and corticosterone in freshly laid eggs. After 1 day of incubation the highest amount of radioactivity was concentrated in a small area at the top of the yolk. This challenges the use of hormones in oil as mimicking natural exposure. During incubation radioactivity spread within the egg with highest concentrations in yolk and yolk sac and lower concentrations in albumen, embryo, allantois, and amnion. Steroids were metabolised to other unconjugated and conjugated steroids, perhaps facilitating embryonic steroid uptake. Our study shows that the injected radiolabel is metabolised in the egg and taken up by the embryo, giving the embryo potential control over the effects of maternal hormones and thereby limiting maternal control over the outcome of hormone-mediated maternal effects.  2009 Elsevier Inc.

In contrast to altricial birds, far less is known about maternal effects in precocial birds. In a previous experiment we found that female quail (Coturnix japonica) that were not previously habituated to humans (NH) produced eggs with less androgens (testosterone, androstenedione) and more progesterone when exposed to human disturbances than females habituated to humans (H). Here, we analysed social motivation and sexual behaviour of the male offspring of NH and H females. Classical behavioural test procedures were applied including separation, runway, partner choice and female encounter tests. As chicks, offspring of the NH females spent more time far from conspecifics than offspring of the H females. As adults, the same NH males showed less crowing and courtship behaviour (ritual preening) in female encounter tests than H males. Thus, maternal environment and egg quality may be key factors in the emergence of individual variability of appetitive behaviour, such as social proximity and courtship behaviour. Human disturbance of the mother seems to have triggered trans-generational effects resulting in consistently reduced social and sexual motivation in offspring until adulthood.  2009 Blackwell Verlag GmbH."

Steroid hormones, which govern female reproduction and are also accumulated by the developing follicle could potentially affect primary sex ratio by differential follicle development in relation to future sex and meiotic drive, or by sex specific influence on oocyte abortion or fertilization. So far, experimental results on the involvement of maternal testosterone (T) in offspring sex manipulation are ambiguous. To investigate the effect of T on primary sex ratio and elucidate underlying mechanisms, we elevated circulating T levels in female homing pigeons (Columba livia). During the course of the experiment females produced three clutches-before and during T implantation, and one year after implant removal. Intriguingly, first eggs, but not second eggs of T females were significantly male biased relative to sham-implanted controls. One year after cessation of the treatment the male bias was still present, indicating long-term effects on female reproductive physiology. T treatment did not affect maternal body condition, nor was body condition correlated with offspring sex ratio. Our data on timing of oviposition, lack of infertile eggs, and yolk weight indicate a possible role for sex specific follicle abortion, perhaps in combination with meiotic drive. However, despite T treatment elevating maternal plasma levels, egg yolk T concentrations did not differ between treatment groups and did not vary with embryo sex, suggesting that yolk T is not involved in meiotic drive.  2009 Elsevier Inc.

Despite the central importance for life-history theory, egg-size effects on offspring fitness are still considered ambiguous. Most previous studies were only observational and consequently might suffer from uncontrolled correlations between egg size and parental/territory quality. Even after cross-fostering is performed, direct genetic effects and parental adjustment of post-natal care might confound our estimates of egg-size effects per se. 2. I performed a full cross-fostering experiment in the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis) exchanging the whole clutches between pairs of nests. I statistically controlled for direct genetic effects and parental feeding frequencies. I followed young until recruitment to estimate the long-term effects of egg size and parental provisioning. In addition, I compared the effects obtained in the cross-fostering experiment with those obtained from a set of unmanipulated nests. 3. Egg size per se affected offspring morphology in both the short and long term, while having no effect on offspring survival and immunity. Egg-size effects were not confounded by parental post-natal care and direct genetic effects. 4. The number of care-givers was an influential predictor of nestling performance. Apart from the variation caused by this factor, feeding frequencies had no consistent effect on offspring performance. 5. Fitness benefits of large eggs may be difficult to establish due to variation of egg-size effects between years and habitats. Feeding frequency may affect offspring state but offspring state may also affect feeding frequency. Varying causality between feeding rate and offspring state may preclude the detection of a positive effect of the former on the latter.  2009 British Ecological Society."

One hundred and twenty Chinese inbred Langshan breeder hens were allocated randomly into two groups fed diets containing low (10%, LP) or normal (15%) crude protein levels. Low dietary protein did not affect the body weight of hens, but significantly decreased the laying rate and egg weight. The yolk leptin content was significantly lower in eggs laid by LP hens, while no differences were detected for yolk contents of corticosterone, tri-iodothyronine (T3) or thyroxine. Despite significantly lower hatch weight, the LP offspring demonstrated obviously higher serum T3 concentration, which is in accordance with the faster post-hatch growth rate achieving significantly heavier body weight and pectoralis major muscle weight 4 weeks post-hatching. Expression of 20-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20-HSD) mRNA in the yolk-sac membrane was significantly down-regulated at embryonic day 14, whereas that of transthyretin and leptin receptor (LepR) was not altered. Moreover, hypothalamic expression of 20-HSD, glucocorticoid receptors, thyrotropin-releasing hormone and LepR mRNA was significantly up-regulated in the LP group compared with their control counterparts. In the pectoralis major muscle, significantly higher expression of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and IGF-I receptor mRNA was observed in LP embryos. The present study provides evidence that maternal LP diet programmes post-hatch growth of the offspring. The associated alterations in yolk leptin deposition as well as in yolk-sac membrane, fetal hypothalamus and muscle gene expression may be involved in mediating such programming effect in the chicken."

Prolactin secretion is stimulated by exposure of the parent to tactile and visual stimuli from the nest, the eggs or the chicks, while prolactin facilitates/stimulates the expression of parental behaviors, such as incubating, brooding or feeding. Because of this role of prolactin in the expression of parental behaviors, we suggest that absolute circulating prolactin levels may reflect to the extent to which individuals provide parental care (i.e., parental effort). Stressors and energetic constraints (acute or chronic) depress prolactin levels ('the prolactin stress response') and this may be adaptive because it may disrupt the current parental effort of an individual and promote its survival. Alternatively, an attenuation of the prolactin stress response can be considered as a hormonal tactic permitting the maintenance of parental care to the detriment of parental survival during stressful situations. Therefore, we suggest that the magnitude of the prolactin stress response may reflect parental investment. Finally, we detail the interaction that links corticosterone, prolactin and stress in bird parents. We suggest that corticosterone and prolactin may mediate different components of the stress response, and, therefore, we emphasize the importance of considering both hormones when investigating the hormonal basis of parental investment.  2009 Elsevier Inc.

We estimated heritability as well as genetic and phenotypic correlations of resting metabolic rate (RMR), body mass and tarsus length with an animal model based on data from a split cross-fostering experiment with brood size manipulations. RMR and body mass, but not tarsus length, showed significant levels of explained variation but for different underlying reasons. In body mass, the contribution to the explained variation is mainly because of a strong brood effect, while in RMR it is mainly because of a high heritability. The additive variance in RMR was significant and the heritability was estimated to 0.59. The estimates of heritability of body mass (0.08) and tarsus length (0.00) were both low and based on nonsignificant additive variances. Thus, given the low heritability (and additive variances) in body mass and tarsus length the potential for direct selection on RMR independent of the two traits is high in this population. However, the strong phenotypic correlation between RMR and mass (0.643  0.079) was partly accounted for by a potentially strong, although highly uncertain, genetic correlation (1.178  0.456) between the two traits. This indicates that the additive variance of body mass, although low, might still somewhat constrain the independent evolvability of RMR.  2009 European Society For Evolutionary Biology."

We conducted a food supplementation experiment on song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) and tested whether song repertoire size, a demonstrated indicator of male quality, differed between the adult sons of fed (food-supplemented) and unfed (non-food-supplemented) parents. Counterintuitively, fed parents produced sons with smaller adult song repertoires, who may thus be expected to contribute fewer offspring, and fewer grand-offspring, to the population. Fed and unfed parents invested equally in the total biomass of their clutches and broods, and average nestling condition was comparable, but because fed parents produced more offspring, average egg and nestling sizes were reduced. Fed and unfed parents apportioned care differently within their broods, and we suggest compensatory growth of offspring emerging from light eggs, or egg size itself, may have affected adult repertoire size. Conceivably, the conservation benefits of food-supplementing populations could attenuate over time if fed parents produce offspring of poorer quality than themselves.  2009 The Royal Society."

Cross-fostering experiments revealed that canary nestling begging intensity is positively correlated with the provisioning level of their own parents (to foster chicks). When we experimentally increased food quality before and during egg laying, mothers showed higher faecal androgen levels and so did their nestlings, even when they were cross-fostered before hatching to be reared by foster mothers that had been exposed to a standard regime of food quality. Higher parental androgen levels were correlated with greater levels of post-hatching parental provisioning and (we have previously shown) increased faecal androgens in chicks were associated with greater begging intensity. We conclude that androgens mediate environmentally induced plasticity in the expression of both parental and offspring traits, which remain correlated as a result of prenatal effects, probably acting within the egg. Offspring can thus adapt their begging intensity to variable family and ecological environments.  2009 The Royal Society."

In this study, we examined whether Adlie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) chicks were sexually dimorphic and whether parents adjusted their parental investment accordingly. Male chicks were on average approximately 10% heavier than female chicks but not larger. Despite the presumed additional cost associated with male chick growth, no fitness cost differences were observed between parents rearing 1 chick whatever its sex: Adult body mass changes and resight rates during the subsequent breeding season were similar. However, the sex of offspring affected the duration of foraging trips during the early guard stage: At this stage, female adults rearing a female chick performed longer foraging trips than female adults rearing a male chick and males rearing either a male or a female chick. We propose that, because female adults present a lower survival rate after a breeding attempt, they are more prone to modify their level of parental investment than male adults. Moreover, the modulation of the foraging behavior by female adults according to the sex of the chick is likely to reduce intraspecific competition at a time when resource availability at sea is not optimal and when food requirement for female chicks may be lower than for male chicks."

Here, we investigate the factors that influence offspring competition in the communally breeding banded mongoose (Mungos mungo). We show that heavy offspring are more likely to win competitive interactions with their littermates. Heavy offspring also receive more care and are more likely to survive to independence in large communal litters where competition is most intense. Our results also indicate that offspring weight at emergence is positively correlated with the weight of the mother at conception. As a consequence, the offspring of heavy mothers are likely to enjoy marked competitive advantages during early life. Together, our findings strongly suggest that the competitive ability of offspring will influence the costs and benefits that females experience while breeding communally and highlights the need for closer examination of the factors that influence offspring competitive ability and the influence this may have on the evolution of communal breeding."

Our experimental studies now add a third mechanism to this list: sex determination via yolk allocation to the egg. Within each clutch, the eggs that produce daughters are larger than those that produce sons. If (and only if) eggs are incubated at low temperatures, removing yolk from a newly laid egg turns the offspring into a male. Adding yolk from a larger (but not smaller) egg turns the recipient egg's offspring into a female.

To explore these issues, we manipulated corticosterone levels in eggs of two Australian lizard species (Amphibolurus muricatus and Bassiana duperreyi) that exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Elevated corticosterone levels during embryonic development affected body size, growth rates, and sex ratios of the resultant offspring, but the direction and magnitude of these effects differed between the species. Corticosterone enhanced growth rates of hatchling B. duperreyi but inhibited growth of A. muricatus. Eggs with elevated levels of corticosterone produced more daughters in A. muricatus and more sons in B. duperreyi. The sex-ratio effect in A. muricatus may have been due to sex-specific embryonic mortality, but it may represent a direct effect on sex determination in B. duperreyi (because embryonic mortality was not affected by corticosterone manipulation in this species).

Although such maternally transmitted hormonal resources have been shown to influence or even interfere with the optimal developmental trajectories of offspring in many taxa, their influence on the dynamics of wild fish populations remains largely unexplored. Here, we examined the extent to which simulated hormonally mediated maternal effects influence the development and early survival of the coral reef damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis. Concentrations of cortisol in the eggs were manipulated within naturally occurring limits by immersion. We found that the proportion of embryos that delayed hatching when exposed to high levels of cortisol was considerably lower than in the other two treatments (low cortisol dose and control). High cortisol levels in P. amboinensis eggs resulted in increased egg mortality and greater asymmetry in hatchlings. For embryos that successfully hatched, individuals from the elevated cortisol treatments (especially low dose) survived longer after hatching. Although individuals that originated from eggs with elevated cortisol levels survived longer after hatching, they may not gain an overall survival advantage. Our results suggest that subtle increases in the allocation of maternally derived hormones, such as cortisol, to offspring are a direct way for stressed mothers to endow their young with an immediate survival advantage. We propose that this immediate benefit outweighs the developmental costs which may be expressed as reduced fitness at later life stages.  2009 Springer-Verlag."

This is generally assumed to be due to higher energy requirements, reflected in higher absolute growth rates of the larger sex. Poor early conditions often increase the sex differences in vulnerability. However, it is not clear whether these patterns are equally pervasive in species where females are larger, as males face an additional early disadvantage due to high levels of testosterone. We investigated sex-specific growth patterns of mass, tarsus and wing of the great skua Stercorarius skua, a seabird with reversed size dimorphism. We were particularly interested in sex-specific effects of early conditions on growth. Beside data from unmanipulated nests, we present results from an egg removal experiment, which caused chicks to hatch from smaller eggs and in poorer body condition. Half of the experimental chicks were raised by pairs in which mothers were in poor body condition. At the end of the nesting period, great skua chicks exhibited a comparable degree of size dimorphism as is found in adults, although neither sex had reached final adult size. Despite females reaching larger asymptotic values of mass and tarsus, timing of growth was not different between the sexes. Absolute growth was higher for females around the time of maximum growth, which suggests that daughters face higher energetic demands. We found sex-specific effects of poor early conditions on growth patterns, although not to the extent which we had predicted. Hatching in poor body condition was related to slowed growth in females but not males. However, our experimental manipulations had no additional negative effect on growth. Our results indicate that daughters in the great skua face higher demands during growth than sons, and that early conditions are more important for the development of the larger sex in this reversed dimorphic species.  2009 J.

We tested the hypothesis that high-quality (i.e., heavy) female eastern kingbirds (Tyrannus tyrannus) that bred early in the breeding season would produce male-biased clutches. A significant opportunity for sexual selection also exists in this socially monogamous but cryptically polygamous species, and we predicted that successful extra-pair (EP) sires would be associated with an excess of male offspring. Although population brood sex ratio did not differ from parity, it increased significantly with female body mass and declined with female breeding date, but was independent of the morphology and display (song) behavior (correlates of reproductive success) of social males and EP sires. Male offspring were significantly heavier than female offspring at fledging. Moreover, the probability that male offspring were resighted in subsequent years declined with breeding date, and was greater in replacement clutches, but lower when clutch size was large. Probability of resighting female offspring varied annually, but was independent of all other variables. Given that variance in reproductive success of male kingbirds is much greater than that of females, and that male offspring are more expensive to produce and have a higher probability of recruitment if fledged early in the season, our results support predictions of sex allocation theory: high-quality (heavy) females breeding when conditions were optimal for male recruitment produced an excess of sons.  2009 Springer-Verlag."

Numerous studies mainly on humans have supported this conclusion, but it is yet unclear how well this applies to other vertebrates. This information would be especially valuable to field biologists to whom measuring steroids in utero is often impossible. The non-human studies conducted so far have yielded inconsistent results, perhaps due to the variety of different methods employed in measuring 2D/4D. We examined the age and sex dependency and lateral asymmetry of 2D/4D in field voles (Microtus agrestis) and compared whether these effects differed between 2D/4D measurements taken from photographs and X-rays. Our results show that 2D/4D measurements from photos had a higher measurement error and gave consistently higher 2D/4D than those from X-rays. According to both measurement methods, the right paw showed higher 2D/4D values than the left paw (lateral asymmetry). Adult voles had a lower 2D/4D than juveniles when measured from X-rays, but not when measured from photographs. We found no evidence for a sex difference in 2D/4D using either of the measurement methods. Our findings thus suggest that X-rays, due to their greater accuracy, should be preferred over photographs for measuring digit ratios in rodents. Our results also indicate that in this species, 2D/4D is laterally asymmetric, but it may not be either fixed in utero or sexually dimorphic. In conclusion, 2D/4D appears to be a rather species- and method-specific measure and researchers should be careful when generalising its applicability to study early hormonal effects in vertebrates.

In many mammalian societies, offspring acquire a social position at adulthood similar to that held by their mother (""rank inheritance"") and thus obtain fitness benefits associated with this status. Mothers may influence the rank of their offspring at adulthood in at least three distinct ways. Firstly, the direct genetic inheritance of maternal traits that influence resource holding potential might predispose offspring to obtain a rank similar to that held by their mother. Secondly, the prenatal maternal environment might influence offspring rank if fetal exposure to maternal androgens is related to maternal status and affects offspring competitiveness. Thirdly, maternal behavioral support, a component of the postnatal maternal environment, may help offspring dominate individuals subordinate to their mother, thereby assisting offspring to acquire a rank similar to that of their mother. Here, we simultaneously test predictions derived from these three potential maternal effects on offspring rank acquisition at adulthood, using cases of offspring adoption in the spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta. We demonstrate that the rank of adopted offspring at adulthood was similar to that of their surrogate mother and that the competitive ability of offspring at adulthood was best explained by postnatal maternal behavioral support."

We analysed yolk steroid levels and egg quality in quail selected for either long or short duration of TI. Yolk steroids, i.e., immunoreactive progesterone and androstenedione, were found to be significantly less concentrated in eggs of the high inherent fearfulness line compared to eggs of the low inherent fearfulness line. A similar trend was found with testosterone levels. Larger eggs with lighter eggshell were also found in more fearful quail. Hence, the selection for divergent fearfulness has led to correlated changes in yolk steroid levels and egg quality. These data suggest that hormones of maternal origin, egg quality and genetic background may all contribute to line differences in phenotype. A modulation of progesterone concentrations by selection for behaviour in egg yolk is reported here for the first time. Although the effect of this hormone on avian embryos remains unknown, we argue it may have significant effects on phenotypic outcome.  2009 BRILL."

We demonstrate via a captive breeding experiment that train length of adult males reflects genetic diversity at the MHC while controlling for genome-wide diversity and that peahens lay more, and larger, eggs for males with a more diverse MHC, but not for males with longer trains.

Fitness of an individual then depends on decisions made concerning energy allocation to particular life-history traits in a given environment. In reptiles and other ectotherms, individuals on a poor diet commonly reach smaller size and invest less in reproduction, but they often produce larger eggs than well-fed individuals. Several lineages of reptiles including geckos have evolved an invariant clutch size as a derived mode of reproduction. Gecko females produce maximally two large eggs per clutch, but clutches are unusually frequent. Therefore, geckos serve as an interesting group for studying the generality of nutrition-dependent plasticity in life-history. In a laboratory experiment, we manipulated diet in adult females of the Madagascar ground gecko Paroedura picta. Both food-limited and well-fed females followed the same growth trajectory in body and head length. In contrast, allocation to reproduction was highly nutrition-dependent. Although females in both treatment groups reproduced, food-limited females compromised both quantity and quality of their progeny: they laid clutches of smaller eggs in longer intervals. Fat storage was formed only in well-fed females. We propose that the results are best explained by the consecutive hierarchical allocation of resources to growth, reproduction and storage, and discuss the consequences for investigation of life-history trade-offs.  2008 British Ecological Society."

In this study we experimentally manipulated the perceived attractiveness of male starlings Sturnus unicolor by increasing the amount of green material in some nests (a male courtship display in this species). We predicted that, if female investment before laying is related to male attractiveness, experimental females would increase their reproductive investment in response to the addition of plants in their nests when compared to control females. We found that our manipulation caused variations in female reproductive investment in a way that seems to influence offspring quantity but not offspring quality: Females laid larger clutch sizes but not larger eggs when green plant material was added. However, yolk androgens contents were not related to the experimental manipulation. Contrary to expectations, females breeding in experimental nests laid eggs with smaller amounts of eggshell pigments. Interestingly, we found that eggs laid later in the sequence had higher testosterone levels and showed more intense egg colouration than eggs laid earlier in the sequence. These differences at the within-clutch level suggest that selection has favoured compensatory strategies for hatching asynchrony. Alternatively, since nest sabotages by other females are most common at the beginning of laying, this could be seen as female strategy to minimise losses due to nest sabotages. As far as we know, this is the first study to show that an external egg characteristic such as blue-green colouration reflects yolk androgen concentration.  2009 Journal of Avian Biology."

The traits that are important in male competition may additionally affect mate choice decisions and a female's investment in the current brood. In a field study on blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, we increased intrasexual competition by experimentally limiting nest sites in experimental plots and compared these plots to control plots. Birds breeding in experimental plots did not differ phenotypically from birds in control plots. However, females that bred in the nest site-limited plots fed their offspring at a higher rate than control females. This result indicates that increased competition for limited resources led to more investment in current reproduction, either because successful females were of higher intrinsic quality or because they adjusted their investment in relation to superior territory or male characteristics.  2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

In this colonially and communally breeding African bird, morphology, condition, age-specific survival rates and reproductive investment vary with colony size. 2. This variation might arise from non-adaptive constraints imposed by density dependence, or from adaptive life-history responses to colony size-dependent selection pressures. To attempt to distinguish these, the environments in which adults made reproductive decisions and in which offspring developed were manipulated. 3. When food supplementation improved the pre-breeding environment of adults, they bred earlier but did not change investment in eggs or incubation. 4. Nestling and subsequent adult phenotypes were unaffected by supplementary feeding, although post-fledging survival improved. Nestling origin and not rearing environment predicted phenotype in a cross-fostering experiment between colonies. 5. Phenotypic differences among colonies hence seemed not to be plastic responses to resource availability. Life-history differentiation, mediated either genetically or maternally, might have taken place over relatively narrow temporal and spatial scales. 6. Adaptive variation in reproductive investment could thus mitigate costs of large colony size, by reducing costs of reproduction and hence improving adult survival. If so, then fine-scale life-history adjustment could help to maintain stable variation in colony size.  2008 British Ecological Society."

In female European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) that do not differ in age, experimental manipulation of photostimulation experience (photoexper- ience) affects hypothalamic, pituitary, and gonadal activity associated with reproductive development. Does photoexperience also affect activity in forebrain regions involved in processing a social cue, the song of males, which can influence mate choice and reproductive timing in females? Female starlings prefer long songs over short songs in a mate-choice context, and, like that in other songbird species, their auditory telen- cephalon plays a major role in processing these signals. We manipulated the photoexperience of female starlings, photostimulated them, briefly exposed them to either long or short songs, and quantified the expression of the immediate-early gene ZENK (EGR-1) in the cau- domedial nidopallium as a measure of activity in the auditory telencephalon. Using an information theoretic approach, we found higher ZENK immunoreactivity in females with prior photostimulation experience than in females experiencing photostimulation for the first time. We also found that long songs elicited greater ZENK immunoreactivity than short songs did. We did not find an effect of the interaction between photoex- perience and song length, suggesting that photoexper- ience does not affect forebrain ZENK-responsiveness to song quality. Thus, photoexperience affects activity in an area of the forebrain that processes social signals, an effect that we hypothesize mediates, in part, the effects of age on reproductive decisions in photoperiodic songbirds.  2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The aim of these models is often to estimate fixed effects and to test their significance. This is usually done by including random intercepts, that is, intercepts that are allowed to vary between individuals. The widespread belief is that this controls for all types of pseudoreplication within individuals. Here we show that this is not the case, if the aim is to estimate effects that vary within individuals and individuals differ in their response to these effects. In these cases, random intercept models give overconfident estimates leading to conclusions that are not supported by the data. By allowing individuals to differ in the slopes of their responses, it is possible to account for the nonindependence of data points that pseudoreplicate slope information. Such random slope models give appropriate standard errors and are easily implemented in standard statistical software. Because random slope models are not always used where they are essential, we suspect that many published findings have too narrow confidence intervals and a substantially inflated type I error rate. Besides reducing type I errors, random slope models have the potential to reduce residual variance by accounting for between-individual variation in slopes, which makes it easier to detect treatment effects that are applied between individuals, hence reducing type II errors as well."

Experimental elevation of yolk corticosterone did not affect hatching success, incubation period or offspring sex ratio. However, corticosterone did have a sex-specific effect on skeletal growth during embryonic development. Male embryos exposed to relatively high levels of corticosterone were smaller on average than control males at hatching whereas females from hormone-treated eggs were larger on average than control females. The data thus suggest that males are not just more sensitive to the detrimental effects of corticosterone but rather that the sexes may have opposite responses to corticosterone during development. Positive selection on body size at hatching for both sexes in this species further suggests that increased corticosterone in egg yolk may have sex-specific fitness consequences, with potential implications for sex allocation and the evolution of hormone-mediated maternal effects."

The T-box transcription factor Tbx6 functions downstream of Macho-1 as a direct activator of Mesp expression. However, Tbx6 cannot account for the restricted expression of Mesp in the B7.5 lineage since it is expressed throughout the presumptive tail muscles. Here we present evidence that the LIM-homeobox gene Lhx3, a direct target of -catenin, is essential for localized Mesp expression. Lhx3 is expressed throughout the presumptive endoderm and B7.5 blastomeres. Thus, the B7.5 blastomeres are the only cells to express sustained levels of the Tbx6 and Lhx3 activators. Like mammalian Lhx3 genes, Ci-Lhx3 encodes two isoforms with distinct N-terminal peptides. The Lhx3a isoform appears to be expressed both maternally and zygotically, while the Lhx3b isoform is exclusively zygotic. Misexpression of Lhx3b is sufficient to induce ectopic Mesp activation in cells expressing Tbx6b. Injection of antisense morpholino oligonucleotides showed that the Lhx3b isoform is required for endogenous Mesp expression.

This species exhibits reversed hatching asynchrony and provides a unique model to test whether there is a strategic investment in corticosterone favoring the B-chick, which is most likely to survive. We found that rockhopper penguins had the highest yolk concentrations of any wild bird species studied so far. Contrary to our expectations, B-eggs had more yolk corticosterone both in concentration and in quantity than A-eggs, independently of the laying period and the level of human disturbance. Additionally, females deposited more yolk corticosterone in their eggs when they were disturbed. However, this disturbance effect was particularly strong for A-eggs and for late-laid eggs. The present data support neither the predictions for an active regulation nor for a passive deposition, and hormone deposition mechanisms still need to be explored.

This suggests that other egg components correlated with yolk androgen levels, rather than yolk androgen levels per se, may influence male parental effort. In conclusion, yolk androgens per se do not appear to mediate sexual conflict over parental investment in the collared flycatcher.  2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Most of the hormone-mediated maternal effects are highly important in the context of sibling competition. However, there is also increasing evidence for long-lasting effects far beyond the nestling period, and these effects may have important consequences on the reproductive success of the offspring. Here, we investigated the effects of experimentally elevated yolk testosterone concentrations on growth and reproduction in female canaries. Elevated yolk testosterone concentrations enhanced the post-natal growth rate, but not the asymptotic mass, and reduced the survival probability. The latter may be a consequence of the higher growth rate, which may have rendered females hatching from testosterone-treated eggs (T-females) more vulnerable to harsh environmental conditions. Adult T-females made a larger investment in their clutch by laying more but not heavier eggs than females hatching from control-treated eggs. Our results suggest that the observed long-lasting effect on clutch size relates to changes in the growth trajectory rather than being a direct consequence of testosterone, since studies manipulating early growth conditions obtained similar results. Clearly, further studies are now required in order to investigate the intriguing relationship between yolk testosterone, elevated growth rates, and clutch size.  2009 Springer-Verlag."

In this study, we investigated whether experimentally elevated social interactions and number of neighbouring pairs influence yolk composition of collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis). Social challenge was simulated by presentation of a conspecific female. Experimental females spent more time near the cage and produced eggs with higher androgen concentration, but local breeding density did not affect yolk androgen level. Moreover, we found that females exposed to more intra-specific interactions and those that bred at higher density produced eggs with smaller yolk. These females may be more constrained in foraging time due to more frequent social encounters, and there might be increased competition for food at areas of higher density. In contrast, the present study did not reveal any evidence for the effect of social environment on yolk antioxidant and immunoglobulin levels. However, we found that yolk lutein and immunoglobulin concentrations were related to the female's H/L ratio. Also, yolk lutein and -tocopherol levels showed a seasonal increase and were positively related to the female's plasma carotenoid level. Mothers may incur significant costs by transferring these compounds into the eggs, thus only females in good physiological condition and those that lay eggs later, when food is probably more abundant, could allocate higher amounts to the eggs without compromising their defence mechanisms. Our results suggest that environmental circumstances during egg formation can influence conditions for embryonic development.  2009 Springer-Verlag."

Gulls are sexually size dimorphic with males larger than females, and there is good evidence that parents in poor body condition switch their investment to the smallest sex. In the present study, we examined the primary sex ratio and the survival of male and female chicks of lesser black-backed gull (Larus fuscus fuscus) in relation to their blood levels of organochlorines (OCs), perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (BDE-47). We show that females with high levels of OCs (but not PFCs and BDE-47) are likely to skew their sex ratio at hatching towards female offspring. Few females had very high levels of OCs, and the many females with low levels of OCs overproduced sons resulting in a male skew at hatching (59%). The survival of female offspring was lower than the survival of male offspring, causing an even stronger male skew in sex ratio (71%). There is evidence to conclude that circulating levels of OCs in the blood of females may have detrimental effect on the sex allocation strategy and could be of serious threat to the population.  2009 Springer-Verlag."

Recently, there have been an increasing number of studies investigating whether pheromones are used in mate choice. Yet, little attention has been paid in exploring the effects of pheromone-based mate choice on reproductive investment. We first tested this hypothesis by providing virgin Scytodes sp. females with a choice between two virgin males in the presence of chemical signals alone and found strong evidence of an odor-based mate preference. We then examined the consequences of the odor-based mate choice by allowing female Scytodes sp. that had previously made an odor-only mate choice to mate with preferred and non-preferred males, respectively. We measured the success of copulation, mortality of male, pre-oviposition interval, egg-sac weight, egg weight, fecundity, fertility, embryonic period, and size of offspring at hatching. Females that mated with the preferred males produced significantly heavier egg sacs that contained more and larger eggs with a greater fertility. Significantly more non-preferred males than preferred males were killed by spitting. However, pre-oviposition interval, embryonic period, and hatchling size were not affected by female mate choice.

In birds, however, few studies have explicitly examined the benefits of mating with several different males; instead, the focus has been on whether or not extra-pair mating occurs, and its adaptive significance remains controversial. We examined the hypothesis that offspring quality, particularly immune response (phytohaemagglutinin assay) and growth, increases with the number of sires in broods of socially monogamous tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor). We found one of the highest known levels of multiple paternity in birds (84% of nests with two or more extra-pair young had at least two extra-pair sires). Among nests with extra-pair young, the number and diversity of sires continued to increase linearly with the number of extra-pair young, so there was no evidence that some males monopolized paternity at high levels of extra-pair fertilization. Indeed, the number of sires was actually greater than expected in large broods, suggesting that some females might be seeking more mates. We found no effect of the number of sires on nestling immune response or growth. In mixed paternity broods, the immune response of extra-pair young did not differ from that of their within-pair half-siblings. However, among all broods, nestlings had a stronger immune response in nests with at least one extra-pair nestling than in nests with all within-pair nestlings. These results are not consistent with a good genes benefit of extra-pair mating, but they do suggest that there are environmental effects associated with extra-pair mating that increase nestling immune response. These environmental effects could produce indirect genetic effects on sexual selection if they are heritable. The extraordinarily high number of sires in this species highlights a relatively unexplored source of sexual selection in birds.  2009 Springer-Verlag."

The phenomenon of phenotype-genotype uncoupling (plasticity) causes problems in species delineations, and has been suggested as a cause underlying a mismatch between morphology and genetics between the Natal Midlands dwarf chameleon (Bradypodion thamnobates) and the KwaZulu dwarf chameleon (Bradypodion melanocephalum). The two species are morphologically distinct, but are very poorly distinguished genetically. It has been hypothesized that B. melanocephalum and B. thamnobates may be phenotypically plastic populations of the same species, since environmental conditions, the driving force behind developmental plasticity, varies between the distributions of these two allopatric taxa. We raised juveniles of both species under identical controlled laboratory conditions. Two treatments were used. These varied in both habitat structure and temperature, each approximating conditions that one of the species would encounter naturally. Although not specifically controlled or monitored, all other environmental factors (e.g. humidity, light and wind) were standardized since chameleons were raised in the artificial conditions created in environmental chambers. If taxa are developmentally plastic, phenotypes would reflect treatment conditions, irrespective of specific associations. Neither B. thamnobates nor B. melanocephalum were phenotypically plastic over the environmental differences tested; species developed into the expected phenotypes, irrespective of treatment conditions. The low genetic difference between B. thamnobates and B. melanocephalum may indicate their recent divergence from a common ancestor or the mitochondrial gene fragments (ND2 and 16S) used in previously published phylogenetic analyses of the genus may not be representative of divergence for the genome as a whole."

One physiological system that links an individual to changes in environmental circumstances during development is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Mammalian studies have linked early postnatal stress to later changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; however, the physiological link [lactational corticosterone (CORT) transfer] between mother and offspring during postnatal development constrains the ability to determine the direct effects of such stressors on subsequent physiology and behavior. Here we present a novel model using an avian species, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), in which maternal hormonal transfer during postnatal development is likely to be absent. Postnatal exposure of chicks to the stress hormone CORT was manipulated for a 16-d period up until nutritional independence (28 d), and the long-term effects on the physiological response to stress determined. CORT doses were scaled to mimic the physiological response of juvenile birds to a capture-handling-restraint protocol. CORT-fed birds showed exaggerated and prolonged responses to acute stress at 60 d of age. Our results clearly demonstrate that postnatal stress has significant long-term effects on the physiological stress response in birds and provides a potential mechanism underlying long-term behavioural responses to developmental conditions. This study represents the first direct evidence for postnatal glucocorticoid programming of the stress response using this novel model for postnatal stress. This model therefore provides an important tool with which to investigate the role of glucocorticoids in shaping adult phenotypes. Copyright  2009 by The Endocrine Society."

Differences in nutritional provisioning in birds during the first month of life can lead to differences in growth, reproductive success and survival. Yet, under natural conditions shorter periods of nutritional stress will be more prevalent. Individuals may respond differently, depending on the period of development during which nutritional stress was experienced. Such differences may surface specifically when poor environmental conditions challenge individuals again as adults. Here, we investigated long term consequences of differences in nutritional conditions experienced during different periods of early development by female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) on measures of management and acquisition of body reserves. As nestlings or fledglings, subjects were raised under different nutritional conditions, a low or high quality diet. After subjects reached sexual maturity, we measured their sensitivity to periods of food restriction, their exploration and foraging behaviour as well as adult resting metabolic rate (RMR). During a short period of food restriction, subjects from the poor nutritional conditions had a higher body mass loss than those raised under qualitatively superior nutritional conditions. Moreover, subjects that were raised under poor nutritional conditions were faster to engage in exploratory and foraging behaviour. But RMR did not differ among treatments. These results reveal that early nutritional conditions affect adult exploratory behaviour, a representative personality trait, foraging and adult's physiological condition. As early nutritional conditions are reflected in adult phenotypic plasticity specifically when stressful situations reappear, the results suggest that costs for poor developmental conditions are paid when environmental conditions deteriorate.  2009 Krause et al."

In this study, we used an integrative approach to examine the influence of yolk androgens on the development of immune function in jackdaw (Corvus monedula) nestlings. Specifically, we tested whether the effects of yolk androgens on offspring immunity may extend over the first few days of life and be detectable even after several weeks. We manipulated yolk androgen concentrations in jackdaw eggs and estimated immune responsiveness by challenging the young with different pathogens at different stages of the nestling period. Six-day-old chicks hatched from eggs with elevated yolk androgen levels had lower pre-challenge antibody titres against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) than control chicks. However, antibody titres against LPS did not differ between treatment groups eight days after a challenge with LPS. During the late nestling phase, both humoral (towards diphtheria/tetanus antigens) and cell-mediated (towards phytohaemagglutinin) immune responsiveness were lower in chicks from yolk androgen-treated eggs compared with control chicks. Our experimental study on jackdaw chicks shows that elevated yolk androgen levels result in a general immunosuppression in offspring; this conclusion was based on results for several immunological tests of both humoral and cell-mediated immunity conducted at 1-2 and 3-4 weeks of age."

In our experiments on Canaries, we investigated how mothers transfer their dietary carotenoid-related benefits to their offspring; either through the egg, or through the diet (during chicks' feeding). Female Canaries were allowed to access -carotene enriched food during egg formation and/or chicks' feeding. We sorted the chicks into four groups using the period when they assimilated the beta-carotene as a variable. The four groups were: (i) before hatching (from yolk), (ii) after hatching (from maternal feeding), (iii) before and after hatching, or (iv) never. Colorimetry and HPLC analysis from sub-samples of yolks confirmed the maternal transfer of dietary carotenoids to the yolk. Our results show that benefits from maternal dietary carotenoids are transferred to the chicks, but according to the period when they are assimilated by the chicks, the physiological effects are different. It was found that the chicks' growth was enhanced when carotenoids were assimilated both before and after hatching. However an increase in cellular immunity efficiency only occurs when the assimilation takes place after hatching.  2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Because female Japanese quail selected for exaggerated (high stress, HS) rather than reduced (low stress, LS) plasma B response to brief mechanical restraint deposit more B into their eggs, these stress lines provide an excellent model to study the relationship between embryonic B and incubation length and hatchling body weight. 2. Differences in the duration of incubation and chick body weight at emergence were assessed using eggs laid by LS and HS quail. 3. On average, eggs from HS hens hatched 3.7 h sooner than did eggs from LS hens while mean body weight at emergence was similar in hatchlings of both lines. Thus, selection for exaggerated adrenocortical responsiveness is associated with a reduction in the length of egg incubation without altering hatchling body weight. 4. This finding is important to the poultry industry because it warns layer, breeder farm and hatchery managers that unless stress in hens during egg formation is avoided, an abbreviated incubation period may result.  2009 British Poultry Science Ltd."

This seemingly conspicuous coloration has puzzled biologists since Wallace, as natural selection should favor reduced egg visibility to minimize predation pressure. The sexual signaling hypothesis posits that blue green egg coloration serves as a signal of female quality and that males exert post-mating sexual selection on this trait by investing more in the nests of females laying more intensely blue green eggs. This hypothesis has received mixed support to date, and most previous studies have been conducted in cavity-nesting species where male evaluation of his partner's egg coloration, relative to that of other females, may be somewhat limited. In this study, we test the sexual signaling hypothesis in colonially nesting ring-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis) where males have ample opportunity to assess their mate's egg coloration relative to that of other females. We used correlational data and an experimental manipulation to test four assumptions and predictions of the sexual signaling hypothesis: (1) blue green pigmentation should be limiting to females; (2) extent of blue green egg coloration should relate to female quality; (3) extent of blue green egg coloration should relate to offspring quality; and (4) males should provide more care to clutches with higher blue green chroma. Our data provide little support for these predictions of the sexual signaling hypothesis in ring-billed gulls. In light of this and other empirical data, we encourage future studies to consider additional hypotheses for the evolution of blue green egg coloration.  2009 Springer-Verlag."

However, both the term allostasis and its underlying model have generated criticism. Here we propose the Reactive Scope Model, an alternate graphical model that builds on the strengths of allostasis and traditional concepts of stress yet addresses many of the criticisms. The basic model proposes divergent effects in four ranges for the concentrations or levels of various physiological mediators involved in responding to stress. (1) Predictive Homeostasis is the range encompassing circadian and seasonal variation - the concentrations/levels needed to respond to predictable environmental changes. (2) Reactive Homeostasis is the range of the mediator needed to respond to unpredictable or threatening environmental changes. Together, Predictive and Reactive Homeostasis comprise the normal reactive scope of the mediator for that individual. Concentrations/levels above the Reactive Homeostasis range is (3) Homeostatic Overload, and concentrations/levels below the Predictive Homeostasis range is (4) Homeostatic Failure. These two ranges represent concentrations/levels with pathological effects and are not compatible with long-term (Homeostatic Overload) or short-term (Homeostatic Failure) health. Wear and tear is the concept that there is a cost to maintaining physiological systems in the Reactive Homeostasis range, so that over time these systems gradually lose their ability to counteract threatening and unpredictable stimuli. Wear and tear can be modeled by a decrease in the threshold between Reactive Homeostasis and Homeostatic Overload, i.e. a decrease in reactive scope. This basic model can then be modified by altering the threshold between Reactive Homeostasis and Homeostatic Overload to help understand how an individual's response to environmental stressors can differ depending upon factors such as prior stressors, dominance status, and early life experience. We illustrate the benefits of the Reactive Scope Model and contrast it with the traditional model and with allostasis in the context of chronic malnutrition, changes in social status, and changes in stress responses due to early life experiences. The Reactive Scope Model, as an extension of allostasis, should be useful to both biomedical researchers studying laboratory animals and humans, as well as ecologists studying stress in free-living animals.  2008 Elsevier Inc.

Strong sibling competition might result in a pattern of resource allocation favoring larger nestlings, but active food allocation towards smaller offspring may compensate for the negative effects of asynchronous hatching. We examined patterns of resource allocation by green-rumped parrotlet parents to small and large broods under control and food-supplemented conditions. There was no difference between parents and among brood sizes in visit rate or number of feeds delivered, although females spent marginally more time in the nest than males. Both male and female parents preferentially fed offspring that had a higher begging effort than the remainder of the brood. Mean begging levels did not differ between small and large broods, but smaller offspring begged more than their older nestmates in large broods. Male parents fed small offspring less often in both brood sizes. Female parents fed offspring evenly in small broods, while in large broods they fed smaller offspring more frequently, with the exception of the very last hatched individual. These data suggest male parrotlets exhibit a feeding preference for larger offspring-possibly arising from the outcome of sibling competition-but that females practice active food allocation, particularly in larger brood sizes. These differential patterns of resource allocation between the sexes are consistent with other studies of parrots and may reflect some level of female compensation for the limitations imposed on smaller offspring by hatching asynchrony."

An increase of competition among adults or nestlings usually negatively affects breeding output. Yet little is known about the differential effects that competition has on the offspring sexes. This could be important because it may influence parental reproductive decisions. 2. In sexual size dimorphic species, two main contradictory mechanisms are proposed regarding sex-specific effects of competition on nestling performance assuming that parents do not feed their chicks differentially: (i) the larger sex requires more resources to grow and is more sensitive to a deterioration of the rearing conditions ('costly sex hypothesis'); (ii) the larger sex has a competitive advantage in intra-brood competition and performs better under adverse conditions ('competitive advantage hypothesis'). 3. In the present study, we manipulated the level of sex-specific sibling competition in a great tit population (Parus major) by altering simultaneously the brood size and the brood sex ratio on two levels: the nest (competition for food among nestlings) and the woodlot where the parents breed (competition for food among adults). We investigated whether altered competition during the nestling phase affected nestling growth traits and survival in the nest and whether the effects differed between males, the larger sex, and females. 4. We found a strong negative and sex-specific effect of experimental brood size on all the nestling traits. In enlarged broods, sexual size dimorphism was smaller which may have resulted from biased mortality towards the less competitive individuals i.e. females of low condition. No effect of brood sex ratio on nestling growth traits was found. 5. Negative brood size effects on nestling traits were stronger in natural high-density areas but we could not confirm this experimentally. 6. Our results did not support the 'costly sex hypothesis' because males did not suffer from higher mortality under harsh conditions. The 'competitive advantage hypothesis' was also not fully supported because females did not suffer more in male-biased broods. 7. We conclude that male nestlings are not likely to be more expensive to raise, yet they have a size-related competitive advantage in large broods, leading to higher mortality of their on average lighter female nest mates.  2008 The Authors."

In this case, the compensatory investment (CI) hypothesis predicts higher investment for low-quality males, because low genetic quality offspring are more dependent on maternal resources. Here, we show that female zebra finches invested more resources, both in terms of egg volume and yolk carotenoid content, when paired to a low genetic quality male, as judged from his previous ability to obtain extra-pair paternity in aviary colonies. We also found that females deposited slightly larger amounts of testosterone into eggs when paired to a low parental quality male, as judging from his previous success in rearing offspring.

Using an experimental elevation of yolk corticosterone (embryonic signal of low maternal quality), we examined potential impacts of embryonic exposure to maternally derived stress on flight performance, wing loading, muscle morphology and muscle physiology in juvenile European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). Here we report that fledglings exposed to experimentally increased corticosterone in ovo performed better during flight performance trials than control fledglings. Consistent with differences in performance, individuals exposed to elevated embryonic corticosterone fledged with lower wing loading and had heavier and more functionally mature flight muscles compared with control fledglings. Our results indicate that the positive effects on a survival-related trait in response to embryonic exposure to maternally derived stress hormones may balance some of the associated negative developmental costs that have recently been reported.

Variation in the quality of the offspring environment can lead to the evolution of variable offspring provisioning. For variable offspring provisioning to evolve, the magnitude of provisioning per offspring must have effects on offspring and parental fitness. 2. Females of the quacking frog, Crinia georgiana, produce clutches of eggs in which egg size varies between individuals in the population and also within clutches, independent of female size or condition. A trade-off between egg size and number exists. 3. Using microsatellite markers to trace offspring to parents, and therefore clutch type, we tested the performance of tadpoles from clutches of large, small and variable-sized eggs in ponds in the field. 4. Clutches of large eggs resulted in the highest parental fitness and clutches of small eggs resulted in lower parental fitness values. 5. The parental fitness indicated that conditions in these ponds were harsh. Clutches with variable egg sizes had intermediate parental fitness but may be of benefit as a bet-hedging strategy when the qualities of ponds are unpredictable. 6. This study provides new empirical evidence of important offspring and parental fitness consequences of variable maternal provisioning under natural conditions in the field and demonstrates the importance of moving experimental life-history studies out of the laboratory into the field where realistic selection pressures act on developing offspring.  2008 The Authors."

In the Australian zebra finch, we investigated whether domesticated stock, bred in captivity over tens of generations, differ in their response to a life-history manipulation, compared to birds taken directly from the wild. In a 'common aviary' experiment, we thereto experimentally manipulated the environmental conditions experienced by nestlings early in life by means of a brood size manipulation, and subsequently assessed its short- and long-term consequences on growth, ornamentation, immune function and reproduction. As expected, we found that early environmental conditions had a marked effect on both short- and long-term morphological and life-history traits in all birds. However, although there were pronounced differences between wild and domesticated birds with respect to the absolute expression of many of these traits, which are indicative of the different selection pressures wild and domesticated birds were exposed to in the recent past, manipulated rearing conditions affected morphology and ornamentation of wild and domesticated finches in a very similar way. This suggests that despite significant differentiation between wild and domesticated birds, selection has not altered the relationships among traits. Thus, life-history strategies and investment trade-offs may be relatively stable and not easily altered by selection. This is a reassuring finding in the light of the widespread use of domesticated birds in studies of life-history evolution and sexual selection, and suggests that adaptive explanations may be legitimate when referring to captive bird studies.  2008 The Authors."

We review evidence and functional explanations for the relationship between androgen concentrations in avian eggs and male attractiveness. Experimental studies in captive birds show generally positive relationships, but results from correlational and experimental field studies are less consistent, perhaps because they lack a within-female design to control for confounding between-female variation. We analyzed the effect of male attractiveness on yolk levels of maternal androgens in a wild bird, using a correlational and experimental approach with a within-female design. We manipulated the sexually selected UV coloration of the crown feathers of male blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) after their female had laid the second egg and measured the subsequent effect on androgen concentrations (testosterone and androstenedione) in the fifth, seventh, and ninth eggs relative to that in the second egg. Levels of testosterone, but not androstenedione, in eggs 5 and 7 were higher for control (attractive) than for UV-reduced (unattractive) males. This effect disappeared in the ninth egg, coinciding with the recovery of UV coloration after manipulation. This suggests that females are capable of rapid adjustments of testosterone deposition in response to changes in their mate's ornamental plumage. However, androgen concentrations in the second egg and pretreatment male crown coloration were not correlated. Possibly, the combination of relatively small variation in UV coloration before treatment and the influence of unknown confounding variables in the correlative approach resulted in insufficient statistical power to detect such a correlation.

However, if females are unable to regulate deposition, then the corticosterone concentration in eggs should reflect that in female plasma and should be influenced by stressors to the females. We measured corticosterone levels in the albumen of rockhopper penguins, and assessed their relationship with hatching order, human disturbance and laying date. Rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome) lay two eggs, of which the second egg (B-egg) is larger and hatches faster than the first egg (A-egg). The chick hatching from the B-egg is also much more likely to survive than its sibling. Albumen corticosterone concentrations were lower in B-eggs. However, as B-eggs contained more albumen than A-eggs, the total corticosterone deposited in the albumen was not significantly different between the two eggs. Daily disturbance by human observers during albumen production did not influence albumen corticosterone levels. Laying date had an effect on total albumen corticosterone through a higher albumen mass. However, we observed a high individual component in the composition of eggs from the same clutch. Thus, more work is required to explore the hypotheses of passive versus active transfer to eggs and to understand the adaptive value of contrary effects on the amount and concentration of corticosterone.  2009 Elsevier Inc.

Such a diversity of perspectives illustrates the composite nature of parental effects that, depending on the stage of their expression and whether they are considered a pattern or a process, combine the elements of developmental induction, homeostasis, natural selection, epigenetic inheritance and historical persistence. Here, we suggest that by emphasizing the complexity of causes and influences in developmental systems and by making explicit the links between development, natural selection and inheritance, the study of parental effects enables deeper understanding of developmental dynamics of life cycles and provides a unique opportunity to explicitly integrate development and evolution. We highlight these perspectives by placing parental effects in a wider evolutionary framework and suggest that far from being only an evolved static outcome of natural selection, a distinct channel of transmission between parents and offspring, or a statistical abstraction, parental effects on development enable evolution by natural selection by reliably transferring developmental resources needed to reconstruct, maintain and modify genetically inherited components of the phenotype. The view of parental effects as an essential and dynamic part of an evolutionary continuum unifies mechanisms behind the origination, modification and historical persistence of organismal form and function, and thus brings us closer to a more realistic understanding of life's complexity and diversity.  2009 The Royal Society."

Paradoxically, their effects can be strikingly specific given the often substantial concentrations present at oviposition, and they do not appear to uniformly affect all steroid-sensitive processes. To better understand the dynamics of yolk steroids across embryonic development, we quantified levels of progesterone, testosterone, and estradiol at 5-day intervals throughout development in eggs of the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta) incubated at both male- and female-producing temperatures. We also assessed the effect of season on yolk steroid levels. For all steroids assayed, the concentrations in yolk declined significantly by day 15 of embryonic development despite large differences in initial concentrations among steroids. We found that estradiol was the only steroid whose initial concentration varied significantly with season, while only the decline in testosterone was affected by incubation temperature. These findings illustrate the complex nature of yolk steroid dynamics and suggest that maternal steroids may be rapidly degraded or subject to embryonic processing, emphasizing the need for studies aimed at understanding the mechanisms through which yolk steroids may elicit their effects.  2009 Elsevier Inc.

Especially in close-ended learning species like the Bengalese finch, conditions experienced during the critical song-learning period can have a profound influence on song quality. Therefore, to understand song evolution from a life-history perspective, we investigated early ontogenetic effects on song quality. In particular, we focused on maternal effects and sibling competition. In asynchronously hatching bird species, the age hierarchy among nestlings affects physical development due to competition for food; mothers may influence this competition by adjusting their investment in each egg according to its sequence in the laying order. To independently assess these effects, chicks of the Bengalese finch were cross-fostered so that the age hierarchies formed in fostered broods were independent of the laying order. Our results indicate that song quality partially reflects early ontogenetic conditions, whereas song duration and note-type repertoire were independent of either laying order or age hierarchy. The syntactical complexity of note order declined over the laying sequence. This finding suggests that the song learning ability is influenced by within-clutch variation in maternal investment toward eggs. Considering that song syntactical complexity is subject to female preference in the Bengalese finch, it is likely that maternal resource allocation strategies play a role in song evolution.  2008 Springer-Verlag."

These signals have recently been shown to be influenced by maternal effects. Indeed, yolk-derived carotenoids are essential for embryos to develop efficient carotenoid metabolism in posthatching life. Maternal effects facilitate adaptation to environmental variability and influence the evolution of phenotypic traits such as secondary sexual signals. Here we propose that maternal investment in yolk carotenoids promotes the evolution of carotenoid-based ornaments. We conducted a comparative analysis of lipid-soluble antioxidants (carotenoids and vitamins A and E) in the eggs of 112 species of bird. Species with large clutch sizes deposited higher yolk concentrations of the three antioxidants. There was a significant positive relationship between yolk carotenoids and the expression of male carotenoid-based signals, but not between yolk carotenoids and sexual dichromatism in these signals. These relationships were specific to carotenoids, as they were not found for vitamins A and E. This provides evidence consistent with the hypothesis that maternal effects mediated by yolk carotenoids play a role in the evolution of carotenoid-based signals as a response to sexual selection, likely based on organizational effects of carotenoids during embryo development.  2009 by The University of Chicago."

Yolk testosterone concentrations and the yolk testosterone content decreased from the early to the latest stage of reproductive period. Testosterone concentrations in the egg yolk as well as the age-dependent pattern significantly differed among individual females. We found high repeatability of yolk testosterone among 3 eggs of individual females together with high repeatability between 3 stages of the reproductive cycle. Testosterone in the egg yolk correlated positively with eggshell weight. Our results suggest that precocial birds with long laying sequences display higher inter-female differences in yolk testosterone concentrations compared with intra-individual variability.

A number of long-lasting effects concern traits of which the expression or development is modulated by androgens. This suggests that the nature of yolk hormone-mediated maternal effects may be organizational. Maternal androgens may therefore play an important role in sexual selection, since the expression of sexually selected male characters is often androgen-dependent. We experimentally manipulated the yolk androgen concentrations of European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris) eggs. Subsequently we followed 49 unrelated males from hatching until year of first reproduction. We investigated the expression of multiple sexually selected male characters (song, beak color and throat feather characteristics), taking into account whether a trait is androgen-dependent. Elevated levels of yolk androgens affected the length of the embryonic period, but did not modify the expression of either androgen-dependent or androgen-independent sexually selected male characters including song phenotype at adulthood. Thus the most important function of yolk androgens in starlings and possibly other bird species may relate to the early developmental period. The outcome of our study together with the results of our meta-analysis indicates that the effects of yolk androgens on sexually selected male characters may be comparatively small. Our results suggest that this may relate to the numerous other environmental and/or genetic factors influencing the expression of sexually selected male characters.  2008 Elsevier Inc.

These strategies are maintained by natural selection resulting from spatial and temporal variation in resource abundance and are particularly evident during range expansion. Yet the mechanisms that maintain close alignment of such strategies with resource availability, integrate suites of dispersal traits and generate variability in dispersal propensity are rarely known. Breeding females can influence offspring phenotype in response to changes in current environmental conditions, making maternal effects uniquely suited to bridge fluctuations in resource abundance in the maternal generation and variation in offspring dispersal ability. Western bluebirds' (Sialia mexicana) dependence on nest cavities - an ephemeral resource - has led to the evolution of two distinct dispersal phenotypes: aggressive males that disperse and non-aggressive males that remain philopatric and cooperate with their relatives. Over the last 40 years, western bluebirds rapidly expanded their geographical range, providing us with an opportunity to test, in newly established populations, the importance of maternal effects for generating variability in dispersal propensity. Here, I show that, under variable resource conditions, breeding females group offspring of different competitive ability in different positions in the egg-laying order and, consequently, produce aggressive males that are more likely to disperse when resources are low and non-aggressive philopatric males when resources are abundant. I then show experimentally that the association between resource availability and sex-specific birth order is robust across populations. Thus, this maternal effect enables close tracking of resource availability and may explain how variation in dispersal is generated in newly colonized populations. More generally, these results suggest that, as a key source of variation in colonizing phenotypes, maternal effects are of crucial importance for understanding the dynamics of range expansion.  2009 The Royal Society."

In birds, maternal androgens enhance both growth and competitive behaviour, but also suppress the immune system. It has been hypothesised that high levels of egg androgens could also influence the prooxidant-antioxidant balance through their positive effect on growth and metabolism. We tested this hypothesis in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata). Eggs were injected with testosterone dissolved in sesame oil or sesame oil only (control). We subsequently assessed the effect of the egg hormone manipulation on nestling growth and nestling plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Growth rates of zebra finch nestlings were not significantly affected by egg hormone treatment. However, male offspring hatched from eggs with experimentally elevated testosterone had reduced plasma TAC at 10 days of age compared with male offspring hatching from control eggs. At the age of 34 days, males had similar plasma TAC irrespective of egg treatment. No effects of egg testosterone manipulation on nestling plasma TAC were found in females. Our results demonstrate that embryonic exposure to elevated levels of testosterone modulates chick antioxidant status, but this seems to be independent of chick growth. Sex-specific effects of prenatal testosterone on plasma TAC of zebra finch nestlings may have important consequences for sex allocation."

We investigated (1) if nestling Great Tits Parus major originating from eggs with naturally high levels of maternal yolk IgG are less susceptible to a common, nest-based ectoparasite, (2) if maternal yolk IgGs influence nestling development and in particular, their own immune defence, and (3) if there is a negative correlation between levels of maternal yolk IgG in host eggs and the reproductive success of ectoparasitic fleas feeding on the nestlings. Counter to expectations, we found no indication that maternally transferred yolk IgGs have direct beneficial effects on nestling development, nestling immune response or nestling resistance or tolerance to fleas. Furthermore, we found no negative correlation between host yolk IgG levels and parasite fecundity. Thus, whereas previous work has unequivocally shown that prenatal maternal effects play a crucial role in shaping the parasite resistance of nestling birds, our study indicates that other egg components, such as hormones, carotenoids or other immuno-active substances, which bird females can adjust more quickly than yolk IgG, might mediate these effects.  2008 The Authors."

The ubiquity of this process contrasts with our ignorance of its evolutionary significance: whereas within-generation accommodation of novel external inputs has clear fitness consequences, current evolutionary theory cannot easily link functional importance and inheritance of novel accommodations. One hundred and twelve years ago, J. M. Baldwin, H. F. Osborn and C. L. Morgan proposed a process (later termed the Baldwin effect) by which non-heritable developmental accommodation of novel inputs, which makes an organism fit in its current environment, can become internalized in a lineage and affect the course of evolution. The defining features of this process are initial overproduction of random (with respect to fitness) developmental variation, followed by within-generation accommodation of a subset of this variation by developmental or functional systems ('organic selection'), ensuring the organism's fit and survival. Subsequent natural selection sorts among resultant developmental variants, which, if recurrent and consistently favoured, can be inherited when existing genetic variance includes developmental components of individual modifications or when the ability to accommodate novel inputs is itself heritable. Here, I show that this process is consistent with the origin of novel adaptations during colonization of North America by the house finch. The induction of developmental variation by novel environments of this species's expanding range was followed by homeostatic channelling, phenotypic accommodation and directional cross-generational transfer of a subset of induced developmental outcomes favoured by natural selection. These results emphasize three principal points. First, contemporary novel adaptations result mostly from reorganization of existing structures that shape newly expressed variation, giving natural selection an appearance of a creative force. Second, evolutionary innovations and maintenance of adaptations are different processes. Third, both the Baldwin and parental effects are probably a transient state in an evolutionary cycle connecting initial phenotypic retention of adaptive changes and their eventual genetic determination and, thus, the origin of adaptation and evolutionary change.  2009 The Royal Society."

Some disciplines in biology have been quicker to appreciate maternal effects than others, and some organisms provide better model systems for understanding the causes and consequences of the maternal environment for ecology and evolution than others. One field in which maternal effects has been poorly represented, and yet is likely to represent a particularly fruitful area for research, is the field of cooperative breeding (i.e. systems where offspring are reared by carers in addition to parent(s)). Here, we attempt to illustrate the scope of cooperative breeding systems for maternal effects research and, conversely, highlight the importance of maternal effects research for understanding cooperative breeding systems. To this end, we first outline why mothers will commonly benefit from affecting the phenotype of their offspring in cooperative breeding systems, present potential strategies that mothers could employ in order to do so and offer predictions regarding the circumstances under which different types of maternal effects might be expected. Second, we highlight why a neglect of maternal strategies and the effects that they have on their offspring could lead to miscalculations of helper/worker fitness gains and a misunderstanding of the factors selecting for the evolution and maintenance of cooperative breeding.

Additional measurements of plasma corticosterone were taken at days 1, 5, and 10 during the 10-day exposure, which occurred during the last third of gestation (of 4-month gestation). These pregnant snakes were from replicate populations of fast- and slow-growth ecotypes occurring in Northern California, with concomitant short and long lifespans. Field corticosterone levels of pregnant females of the slow-growth ecotype were an order of magnitude higher than fast-growth dams. In the laboratory, corticosterone levels increased over the 10days of corticosterone manipulation for animals of both ecotypes, and reached similar plateaus for both control and treated dams. Despite similar plasma corticosterone levels in treated and control mothers, corticosterone-treated dams produced more stillborn offspring and exhibited higher total reproductive failure than control dams. At one month of age, offspring from fast-growth females had higher plasma corticosterone levels than offspring from slow-growth females, which is opposite the maternal pattern. Offspring from corticosterone-treated mothers, although unaffected in their slither speed, exhibited changes in escape behaviors and morphology that were dependent upon maternal ecotype. Offspring from corticosterone-treated fast-growth females exhibited less anti-predator reversal behavior; offspring from corticosterone-treated slow-growth females exhibited less anti-predator tail lashing behavior.  2008 Elsevier Inc.

The red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans) exhibits temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), a system where incubation temperature during a temperature-sensitive period of development determines offspring sex. However, gonadal sex is sensitive to both temperature and hormones during this period-particularly estrogen. We present a model for temperature-based differences in aromatase expression as a critical step in ovarian determination. Localized estrogen production facilitates ovarian development while inhibiting male-specific gene expression.

The current focus on static outcomes of sex-determination provides little insight into the dynamic developmental processes by which some mechanisms acquire the role of sex determinants. Systems that combine ""genetic"" pathways of sex-determination (i.e., sex chromosomes) with ""environmental"" pathways (e.g., epigenetically induced segregation distortion) provide an opportunity to examine the evolutionary relationships between the two classes of processes and, ultimately, illuminate the evolution of sex-determining systems. Taxa with sex chromosomes typically undergo an evolutionary reduction in size of one of the sex chromosomes due to suppressed recombination, resulting in pronounced dimorphism of the sex chromosomes, and setting the stage for emergence of epigenetic compensatory mechanisms regulating meiotic segregation of heteromorphic sex chromosomes. Here we propose that these dispersed and redundant regulatory mechanisms enable environmental contingency in genetic sex-determination in birds and account for frequently documented context-dependence in avian sex-determination. We examine the evolution of directionality in such sex-determination as a result of exposure of epigenetic regulators of meiosis to natural selection and identify a central role of hormones in integrating female reproductive homeostasis, resource allocation to oocytes, and offspring sex. This approach clarifies the evolutionary relationship between sex-specific molecular genetic mechanisms of sex-determination and non-sex-specific epigenetic regulators of meiosis and demonstrates that both can determine sex. Our perspective shows how non-sex-specific mechanisms can acquire sex-determining function and, by establishing the explicit link between physiological integration of oogenesis and sex-determination, opens new avenues to the studies of adaptive sex-bias and sex-specific resource allocation in species with genetic sex-determination.  2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Towards understanding the role of the CRF system in vertebrate development, we describe the ontogeny of the CRF system, cortisol, and the stress response in the zebrafish, Danio rerio. Early embryonic expression of mRNA encoding CRF, urotensin I (UI), CRF-binding protein (CRF-BP), and two CRF receptors (CRF-R1 and CRF-R2) suggest a function in the early organization of the developing embryo. The expression patterns of CRF, UI, and CRF-BP in the larval brain are consistent with the adult distribution patterns for these genes and support HPI-axis independent functions. The relative amounts of CRF and UI mRNA in the heads and tails of developing and adult zebrafish suggest that CRF functions primarily in the brain while UI also plays an important role in the caudal neurosecretory system. The amount of cortisol in developing zebrafish is low and relatively constant through the first 6 days of development. The commencement of feeding after 4 dpf, however, significantly increases basal cortisol production. Finally, we show that zebrafish larvae are able to respond to an osmotic stressor as early as 3 dpf. Overall, results from this study establish the zebrafish as a model species for research on stress during ontogeny and offer new insights into an HPI-axis independent function for the CRF system during embryogenesis.  2009 Elsevier Inc.

The majority of studies focuses on androgens, but also significant amounts of progesterone as well as other steroid hormones have been measured. The question if corticosterone is also present in eggs of chickens is currently under debate. The only analytical validation performed so far has failed to demonstrate corticosterone in the yolk of chickens, suggesting that antibodies for corticosterone measurement cross-react with other steroids present in the yolk. In order to investigate this assumption and to characterise potential cross-reacting hormones in more detail, we performed high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analyses of chicken yolk extracts and determined the concentration of immunoreactive corticosterone, progesterone and cortisol. The progesterone antibody revealed several immunoreactive substances, including progesterone, pregnenolone and two substances with lower polarity. The corticosterone enzyme immunoassay detected immunoreactive substances at exactly the same elution positions as the progesterone assay and a very small peak at the elution position of corticosterone. Immunoreactive cortisol was not found. In addition, inner and outer regions of the yolk sphere were analysed separately via HPLC. We found different concentrations of immunoreactive substances between the inner and outer yolk regions, probably reflecting the steroidogenic activity of the follicle cells during oocyte growth. We conclude that in homogenised yolk extracts without previous clean-up, the measured corticosterone concentrations may actually reflect those of progesterone and its precursors, most probably being 5- and 5-pregnanes and pregnenolone.  2009 Elsevier Inc.

Exposures to environmental EDCs may have devastating effects on the individual, its offspring, and even populations. Reproductive neuroendocrine systems, hormones, and sexual behaviors are especially vulnerable to endocrine-disruptive exposures that occur during key periods of development. The vertebrate brain may be perturbed by even very low-level, subtoxic EDC exposures during the critical period of brain sexual differentiation (particularly embryonic and early postnatal developmental stages) because of its extremely high sensitivity to hormones or hormonally active compounds at these life stages. Often, these effects of EDCs are not manifested at birth, enabling the organism to develop, mature, and even potentially to reproduce. This is of serious concern since these animals compete with healthy conspecifics, and may pass on genetic or epigenetic traits to subsequent generations, thereby proliferating the problem.

The developmental stress hypothesis proposes that suboptimal early development affects the costly brain structures involved in male song learning and, as a consequence, song quality. As an extension of this hypothesis we tested in this study whether developmental conditions also modulate female song preference acquisition. We tested song preferences in adult female zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, originating from a brood size manipulation experiment that had induced differences in mass, condition, immune response and levels of plasma testosterone at the early nestling stage. During the song-learning phase, juvenile birds were housed in small mixed-treatment groups with unrelated adult male song tutors. Adult females' song preferences were tested in an operant set-up where females could trigger different song playbacks by pecking different response keys. When females could choose between their own and an unfamiliar tutor's song they preferred their tutors' songs independent of experimental brood size. However, when females chose between two unfamiliar songs there was a significant effect of experimental brood size on preference strength: females from small broods showed significantly stronger preferences than those from medium and large broods. Hence, both females' rearing environment and sensory learning processes appear to contribute to variation in the direction and strength of female preference for male mating signals.  2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

This chapter focuses on the present state of the field of fertilization and the nature of sperm-egg interactions (SEIs), with particular emphasis on evolutionary mechanisms and processes that have driven this important aspect of the life history of sexual organisms. The goal of the chapter is to illustrate the variation in fertilization systems at the level of SEIs and common/disparate SEI processes and to provide evidence for the evolutionary significance of SEIs. A detailed understanding of the molecular makeup of sperm will be necessary to fully assess the role sperm play in SEIs. They contain other essential elements necessary for production of a viable diploid organism carried into the maternal cytoplasm during fertilization. During fertilization and early embryonic development, sperm and egg interact in a variety of ways. The chapter primarily focuses on the initial stages of sperm-egg interactions near/at their surfaces and ending at the stage of the first mitotic division of the embryo. The SEIs discussed encompass those interactions that take place between the gametes both at their surfaces, at or near these surfaces, and subsequently, once sperm are inside the egg at the terrestrial invertebrates. &copy; 2009 Copyright  2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Eggs were collected and analyzed for carotenoid content and stable isotopes (15N and 13C) in the yolk to determine whether variation in the type of food eaten contributes to egg size. We also report on the isotopic analysis of American Coot tissues and their eggs to assess evidence of endogenous versus exogenous protein and lipid allocations to reproduction. We provide isotopic evidence that American Coots used endogenous lipid, but not protein, reserves for egg formation and that egg size is more dependent on exogenous sources of nutrients. Laying sequence was the only variable across nesting locales that had a significant influence on the size of eggs. There was an effect of provisioning food at only one site; however, this response was driven by a component of diet quality other than carotenoids. Yolk 13C values were positively correlated with egg volume, which further suggests the importance of diet quality in determining egg size in American Coots.

Both innate and adaptive type of immunity are transferred of from mother to offspring in fishes. These factors include immunoglobulin (Ig)/antibody, complement factors, lysozymes, protease inhibitors like  macroglobulin, different types of lectins and serine proteases like molecules. Among different types of Ig viz. IgM, IgD, IgT/IgZ and IgM-IgZ chimera types, IgM is present in most of the teleostean fishes. In teleosts, IgM either as a reduced/breakdown product or monomeric form is usually transferred to the offsprings. The maternally derived IgM usually persists for a limited duration, exhausts within the completion of yolk absorption process, and completely disappears thereafter during larval stages. Maternal transfer of immunity which provides defense to embryo and larvae depends upon the health as well as the immune status of brood fish. The overall health status of brood fish can affect breeding performances, quality seed production and protection of offsprings. However, factors such as age, maturation, reproductive behaviour and nutrition (micro and macro-nutrients) may affect the immunity in brood fishes. Besides these, seasonal changes such as photoperiods, temperature, adverse environmental conditions, and stress conditions like handling, crowding, and water pollution/contamination can also affect the immunity of brood fishes. The maintenance of the brood stock immunity at high level during vitellogenesis and oogenesis, is utmost important for reducing mortalities at larval/post larval stages through maximum/optimum transfer of maternal immunity. Brood stock immunization prior to breeding as well as selective breeding among the disease resistant families might be the ideal criteria for producing quality seed.  2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Although various components of these complex interactions can be studied in a reductionistic manner, they also lend themselves to analysis at all levels from organismic to cellular and molecular. This review offers a synthesis of behavioral and neuroendocrine research with cellular work and provides a theoretical framework with which to approach the study of feminine sexual behavior from multiple directions and at multiple levels.

The latter raised the possibility that estrogens' membrane-initiated actions can synergize with their genomic actions. We have turned this possibility into a reality by first using cultured cells and then whole animals. With cultured neuroblastoma and MCF-7 breast cancer cells, we demonstrated that membrane-initiated estrogen actions could facilitate subthreshold doses of estradiol to accomplish a transcriptional facilitation, and found that the facilitation was mediated, at least in part, by pathways involving PKA and PKC. Using the estrogen-dependent rodent female sexual behavior, lordosis, as a study model, we found that implantation of a membrane-impermeable estrogen, which by itself could not induce the behavior, in the hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus (VMN) of female rats facilitated subthreshold estradiol similarly implanted later to induce lordosis. These findings, to our knowledge, comprise the first demonstration of the synergism between estrogen's membrane-initiated and genomic actions. Consistent with our cell culture studies, the facilitation of lordosis induction also required functioning PKA and PKC. Several lines of evidence indicated that an increase in neuronal activity during the initial stage of estrogen administration is required for the induction of lordosis. Therefore, whether the activity of VMN neurons is modulated by the membrane-initiated actions of the estrogen applied to the hypothalamus was investigated. With extracellular single-neuron recording of VMN cells in hypothalamic slices of female rats, it was found that acutely applied estradiol (acute E2) could i) potentiate the excitation mediated by two distinct types of receptors, G protein-coupled excitatory histamine (HA) receptors and NMDA ion channel/receptors, and ii) attenuate inhibition caused by G protein-coupled inhibitory HA receptors. These findings raised the possibility that acute E2 can potentially working through three independent mechanisms to modulate these responses. This possibility was evaluated using whole cell patch clamp studies. Corresponding to extracellular recording findings, HA could evoke de- and/or hyper-polarization, and NMDA could evoke only depolarization. Acute application of E2 could, again, potentiate HA and NMDA depolarization and attenuate HA hyperpolarization. To search for mechanisms, pharmacological analyses of HA responses were performed to define receptors responsible for excitation and inhibition, and effects of acute E2 on individual types of HA receptors were studied. Results from these studies, together with current knowledge about HA receptors, point to a likely mechanism underlying non-genomic estrogen modulations of HA responses: acute E2 inhibits K + channels through the facilitation of G q/11 coupled to histaminergic H1 receptors, to potentiate HA depolarization/ excitation as well as to attenuate hyperpolarization/inhibition. We also searched for mechanism(s) underlying acute E2 potentiation of NMDA depolarization/excitation by characterizing NMDA actions. We found that both NMDA and acute E2 could reduce afterhyperpolarizations, which are mediated by Ca ++ -activated K + channels. Therefore, attenuation of these channels appears to be one way acute E2 can potentiate NMDA depolarization/excitation. Thus, in the induction of lordosis at least, membrane-initiated non-genomic estrogen actions appear to facilitate genomic actions by both activating signaling pathways involving PKA and PKC and by inhibiting certain K + channels. 2009 by The Chinese Physiological Society."

This includes its ability to live successfully within a social group. We show that there is a tendency for right brain hemisphere dominance when performing social cognitive actions. As such, chicks show a left hemispatial bias for approaching a signalled target object, tend to perceive gaze and faces of human-like masks more effectively when using their left eye, are able to inhibit a pecking response more effectively when viewing a neighbour tasting a bitter substance with their left eye, and are better able to perform a transitive inference task when exposed to light in the egg and when forced to use their left eye only compared to dark-hatched or right eye chicks. Some of these effects were sex specific, with male chicks tending to show an increased effect of lateralization on their behaviours.

Interpreting this result in light of studies of sex steroid hormone involvement in sex determination, they suggested that maternally derived yolk steroid hormones could constrain sex-determining mechanisms in TSD reptiles. We have worked extensively with this species and have routinely incubated clutches at constant temperatures. To test the consistency of high frequency same-sex clutches across different incubation temperatures, we examined our records of clutches at the University of Texas at Austin from 1992 to 2001. We observed that clutches in which eggs were incubated at the same incubation temperature produced mixed-sex clutches as well as same-sex clutches. Furthermore, cases in which eggs within a clutch were separated and incubated at different temperatures produced the expected number of mixed-sex clutches. These results suggest that maternal influences on sex determination are secondary relative to incubation temperature effects.  2008 Springer-Verlag."

Long-term organizational effects of yolk hormones on adult behavior and the underlying mechanisms that generate them have been largely ignored. Using an experiment in which hand-reared house sparrows (Passer domesticus) from testosterone- or control-treated eggs were kept under identical conditions, we show that testosterone treatment in the egg increased the frequency of aggressive, dominance, and sexual behavior of 1-year-old, reproductively competent house sparrows. We also show that circulating plasma levels of progesterone, testosterone, 5-dihydrotestosterone, and 17-estradiol did not differ between treatment groups. Thus, a simple change in adult gonadal hormone secretion is not the primary physiological cause of long-term effects of maternal steroids on adult behavior. Rather, differences in adult behavior caused by exposure to yolk testosterone during embryonic development are likely generated by organizational modifications of brain function. Furthermore, our data provide evidence that hormone-mediated maternal effects are an epigenetic mechanism causing intra-sexual variation in adult behavioral phenotype.  2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Many diverse forms of genomic conflict have been identified, but this extant tally may be incomplete. Here, we show that the unusual characteristics of the sex chromosomes can, in principle, lead to a previously unappreciated form of sexual genomic conflict. The phenomenon occurs because there is selection in the heterogametic sex for sex-linked mutations that harm the sex of offspring that does not carry them, whenever there is competition among siblings. This harmful phenotype can be expressed as an antagonistic green-beard effect that is mediated by epigenetic parental effects, parental investment, and/or interactions among siblings. We call this form of genomic conflict sexually antagonistic ""zygotic drive"", because it is functionally equivalent to meiotic drive, except that it operates during the zygotic and postzygotic stages of the life cycle rather than the meiotic and gametic stages. A combination of mathematical modeling and a survey of empirical studies is used to show that sexually antagonistic zygotic drive is feasible, likely to be widespread in nature, and that it can promote a genetic ""arms race"" between the homo- and heteromorphic sex chromosomes. This new category of genomic conflict has the potential to strongly influence other fundamental evolutionary processes, such as speciation and the degeneration of the Y and W sex chromosomes. It also fosters a new genetic hypothesis for the evolution of enigmatic fitness-reducing traits like the high frequency of spontaneous abortion, sterility, and homosexuality observed in humans.  2008 Rice et al."

However, some studies imply that this opportunistic breeding may be superimposed on an underlying seasonality, which has effects on the readiness to breed when conditions are favourable. The zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) is the classic opportunistic breeder and widely used as such in studies. In a series of laboratory-based breeding experiments, we found evidence to suggest that there are seasonal differences in maternal reproductive investment in the zebra finch even when photoperiod, temperature, relative humidity and diet were held constant. Females showed highly significant seasonal differences in clutch size and egg mass with laying order. Clutch size showed a spring/summer peak typical of multi-brooded species in the wild. There was also a significant increase in egg mass with laying order in all seasons except winter. This variation in breeding parameters with season may allow females to adjust investment depending on the potential fitness returns from a given reproductive attempt.

We measured digits and other morphological traits of birds from three orders (Passeriformes, house sparrow, Passer domesticus; tree swallow, Tachycineta bicolor; Pscittaciformes, budgerigar, Melopsittacus undulates; Galliformes, chicken, Gallus domesticus) to test this prediction. None were sexually dimorphic for 2D:4D and there were no associations between 2D:4D and other sexually dimorphic traits. When we pooled data from all four species after we averaged right and left side digits from each individual and z-transformed the resulting digit ratios, we found that males had significantly larger 2D:4D than did females. Tetrapods appear to be sexually dimorphic for 2D:4D with 2D:4D larger in males as in some birds and reptiles and 2D:4D smaller in males as in some mammals. The differences between the reptile and mammal lineages in the directionality of 2D:4D may be related to the differences between them in chromosomal sex determination.

Yolk lutein supplementation enhanced the growth of sons from first eggs but depressed that of sons from last eggs, enhanced survival of daughters late in the season, and promoted immunity of male chicks and chicks from small eggs. Lack of variation in egg carotenoids in relation to sex and egg features, and the contrasting effects of lutein on sons and daughters, do not support the hypothesis of optimal sex-related egg carotenoid allocation.

The present study examined the relationship between plasma and egg albumen corticosterone concentrations and then determined what affect exposing hens to known stressors had on egg albumen corticosterone concentrations. Laying hens were given subcutaneous injections of either 0, 5, or 10mg of corticosterone suspended in peanut oil and then the concentrations of corticosterone in the plasma and egg albumen determined. Also, groups of hens were handled, exposed to high ambient temperature and moved to new cages, all events known to be stress provoking, and then the concentrations of corticosterone in albumen determined. The injections increased plasma corticosterone concentrations substantially and these were directly related to the concentrations measured in the egg albumen. When hens were exposed to the various stressors, the level of corticosterone in the egg albumen increased.

In this study we examine differences in chick development in relation to sex and hatching order in the socially monogamous bearded tit Panurus biarmicus. Our results revealed that significantly more female than male nestlings were the biggest in the brood. Allometric measurements seem to be a good predictor of age (hatching order). This consequently means that female nestlings frequently hatch earlier and have a higher initial body mass. In contrast male nestlings seem to develop much faster than female nestlings. By modifying the hatching order in favour of female nestlings, mothers seem to promote daughters to compensate for their slower growth."

Stress is an animal welfare parameter that has been found to alter laying hens' physiology and social behaviour. Our study aims to test the effects of the different housing systems (laying cage, barn and free range) on the laying hens' welfare. In this study we have taken a new approach to determine stress levels by measuring corticosterone and androgen concentrations in the eggs laid by hens housed in different farming systems. We found no relationship between commercial egg production type and androgen (testosterone and androstenedione) levels. Contrary to our expectations, we observed an almost significant positive trend between corticosterone levels and welfare quality: free range eggs contained the highest corticosterone concentrations. This would initially suggest that free range hens are more stressed than battery or barn hens. However, considering that chronic stressors can reduce an organism's hormonal output, our results could suggest that the low levels of corticosterone in battery hens are an indication of a chronic stress situation. Our data suggest that measuring corticosterone in eggs is a novel non-invasive method to determine stress levels in laying hens.

Of particular interest to fisheries scientists and managers is the role of the demographic structure of the adult component of fish populations in the formation of future year classes. Traditionally, fisheries managers tended to assess whole populations without regard to variation between the individuals within the population. In doing so, they overlooked the variation in spawning production between individual females as a source of variation to recruitment magnitude and fluctuation. Indeed, intensive and/or selective harvesting of larger and older females, those that may produce more-and higher quality-offspring, has been implicated in the collapse of a number of important fish stocks. In a fisheries resource management context, whether capture fisheries or aquaculture, female demographics and inter-female differences warrant serious consideration in developing harvesting and breeding strategies, and in understanding general population dynamics.

The sign of sexual dimorphism in digit ratios may, however, vary both within and between vertebrate classes. It has been hypothesized that sex differences in digit ratios arise via differential prenatal exposure of the two sexes to steroids, which may affect the expression of the Hox genes controlling the osteometric development of digits and appendices. Among birds, the evidence for sex dimorphism in hind-limb digit ratios is conflicting, though all previous studies were based on measurements of undissected digits, implying that results could be confounded by sex-related variation in soft tissues. Here we report that digit ratios derived from radiographs of both feet of a large passerine bird, the hooded crow (Corvus corone), are sexually dimorphic, males showing larger 2D:3D (effect size, r = 0.33) and 2D:4D than females (effect size, r = 0.28). We also observed a good agreement (r = 0.45) between radiographic estimates of digit ratios and digit ratios calculated based on undissected digit measurements (thus including soft tissues). Importantly, we found that the patterns of sex and side differences were largely coherent between the two methods. Therefore, our findings show for the first time in avian species that sex differences in digit ratios have an osteometric basis, a fundamental prerequisite for a role of Hox genes in originating such dimorphism.  2008 The Authors Journal compilation  2008 Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland."

Social dominance was strongly associated with clutch sex ratio, with the difference in clutch sex ratio between the most and least dominant pairs being 30-40%. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an association between social dominance and sex allocation in birds. However, the direction of this effect varied between years. Dominant jackdaws produced more sons during the first years of the study but fewer sons during the last years. Offspring sex was not related to laying order within a clutch, and the effect of social dominance on sex ratio was similar on eggs laid first, middle, or last. We investigated the effect of 2 factors (laying date and parental condition) that could have mediated the shift in the effect of social dominance on sex allocation in the course of the study. Laying date was positively associated with the proportion of males, but this effect was independent of social dominance. Maternal condition (residual mass over tarsus and egg volume) was related to social dominance but not to clutch sex ratio. Paternal condition (residual mass over tarsus) was not related to clutch sex ratio. We discuss how spatial or temporal variation in effects of variables such as social dominance on sex allocation can contribute to our understanding of the evolution of sex allocation in species with complex life histories.

Maternal identity had strong effects on offspring morphology, but the nature of maternal effects differed among successive clutches produced by females throughout the reproductive season (i.e. maternal identity by environment interactions). The among-female and among-clutch variation in offspring traits (including sex ratios) was not mediated through maternal body size, egg size, or variation in yolk steroid hormones. This lack of nongenetic maternal effects suggests that phenotypic variation may be generated by gene by environment interactions.

Thus, when sexual ornaments signal the quality of the male, females might invest in reproduction as a function of the attractiveness of their mate. We tested whether breeding conditions and male feet colour influence reproductive decisions of blue-footed booby females. In the blue-footed booby, male feet colour is a dynamic condition-dependent sexually selected trait that is related to paternal effort. During two consecutive years, an El Nio year (poor breeding conditions) and a year with good breeding conditions, we experimentally reduced male attractiveness by modifying their feet colour after the first egg was laid and recorded female investment in the second egg. We found that, relative to the first egg in the clutch, females laid heavier second eggs during the poor year than during the good year. Females paired with males with duller feet colour reduced second-egg mass and volume and delayed the laying of the second egg, independently of the year. Absolute yolk androstenedione (A4) concentration (but not testosterone, T) in second eggs was higher during a poor year than during a good year. Only during a year with poor breeding conditions, females paired with experimental males decreased the relative A4 concentration (but not T) in the second egg compared to control females. Thus, blue-footed booby females probably favour brood reduction by decreasing egg quality and increasing size asymmetry between chicks when the breeding and the mate conditions are poor.  2008 Springer-Verlag."

Although embryonic exposure to maternally derived glucocorticoids (i.e., corticosterone) generally reduces offspring quality, effects may adaptively match maternal quality with offspring demand. We present results from an interannual field experiment in European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) designed explicitly to examine the fitness consequences of exposing offspring to maternally derived stress hormones. We combined a manipulation of yolk corticosterone (yolk injections) with a manipulation of maternal chick-rearing ability (feather clipping of mothers) to quantify the adaptive value of corticosterone-induced offspring phenotypes in relation to maternal quality. We then examined how corticosterone-induced ""matching"" within this current reproductive attempt affected future fecundity and maternal survival. First, our results provide support that low-quality mothers transferring elevated corticosterone to eggs invest in daughters as predicted by sex allocation theory. Second, corticosterone-mediated sex-biased investment resulted in rapid male-biased mortality resulting in brood reduction, which provided a better match between maternal quality and brood demand. Third, corticosterone-mediated matching reduced investment in current reproduction for low-quality mothers, resulting in fitness gains through increased survival and future fecundity. Results indicate that the transfer of stress hormones to eggs by low-quality mothers can be adaptive since corticosterone-mediated sex-biased investment matches the quality of a mother to offspring demand, ultimately increasing maternal fitness. Our results also indicate that the branding of the proximate effects of maternal glucocorticoids on offspring as negative ignores the possibility that short-term phenotypic changes may actually increase maternal fitness.  2008 by The University of Chicago.

This hypothesis is based in the antioxidant properties of biliverdin whose costly deposition in the eggshell is expected to signal female antioxidant capacity and egg quality. Since maternally derived androgens are costly to produce and may adaptively affect offspring phenotype, high-quality females may benefit by signalling their androgen investment through egg colouration. Our aim was to investigate whether egg colour variation in the spotless starling reflected the amount of pigments on the eggshell and whether egg pigmentation was related to female and egg quality. Chromatography analyses revealed that spotless starling eggshells contained two different pigments: biliverdin and protoporphyrin IX with no correlation between them. Biliverdin contents correlated positively with egg colouration indicating that darker eggs with a higher peak in the blue-green segment of the spectrum contained higher amounts of biliverdin. Eggs containing more biliverdin were laid by high-quality females and contained higher yolk testosterone levels. However, despite the strong correlation between biliverdin and colorimetric variables, egg colouration did not reflect accurately female and egg quality. Our results provide evidence that eggshell pigmentation in the spotless starling is related to female and egg quality as shown by the yolk testosterone levels. However, the lack of relation between egg colour and female condition and egg quality do not provide evidence to support the signalling function of egg colouration.  2008 Springer-Verlag."

The evolutionary conflict over the duration and amount of parental care is thought to promote the evolution of offspring begging behaviours either as honest signals of need or as competitive signals with the potential to manipulate parents into investing more. In most social insects, parental care is not obligatory and may represent a less derived state than in vertebrate systems making them more appropriate to test ancestral conditions for the evolution of begging signals. Here, we review forms of maternal care in insects ranging from protection to food provisioning and evidence of offspring begging behaviours influencing maternal care, including condition-dependent chemical cues produced by offspring that may turn out to be solicitation pheromones. Since behavioural parent-offspring interactions are embedded in the reproductive and developmental physiology of mother and offspring, we stress the need for behavioural studies to be complemented by physiological measurements which will allow us to understand better the nature of conflict resolution. We propose a hypothetical mechanism of maternal care regulation by direct internal chemical signals (i.e. hormones) and indirect external chemical signals (i.e. solicitation pheromones) influencing maternal reproductive physiology and future reproduction.

Passerine birds typically use a combination of physiological mechanisms and environmental cues to ensure that breeding, moult and migration occur without major temporal overlap and under the most favourable conditions. However, late in the breeding season some individuals initiate additional clutches, whereas others initiate moult. Such alternative strategies are thought to reflect trade-offs between reproductive benefits and timely investment in maintenance and survival. The degree of seasonal plasticity differs between species, depending on the mechanisms that govern their annual routine. Migrants are generally under pressure to complete breeding and moult before the autumn departure and often show little plasticity. We studied seasonal plasticity of breeding and moult schedules in the European Stonechat Saxicola rubicola. This species, an obligate short-distance migrant in Central Europe, sometimes initiates late clutches after typically at least two earlier breeding attempts. Based on life-history theory and on observations in captivity, which revealed photoperiodic regulation of breeding and moult, we predicted relatively little seasonal plasticity in Stonechats. We further predicted that reproductive gains of late breeders should be offset by reduced survival. These predictions were tested on long-term field data, using Underhill-Zucchini models to estimate moult. Late breeding occurred in c. 40% of pairs and increased their reproductive success by a third. Both sexes modified moult timing but in different ways. Late breeding females postponed moult approximately until chick independence without compensating for delay by faster moult. Males started moult on time and overlapped it with breeding, associated with markedly slowed plumage change. Sex differences in moult score increased with lay date, but due to their respective modifications, both sexes delayed moult completion. Nonetheless, we could not detect any evidence for survival costs of late breeding. Breeding and moult of European Stonechats appear relatively flexible, despite migratory schedules and photoperiodic programs for seasonal timing. Individuals can modify seasonal behaviour in late summer, presumably depending on their condition, and may profit considerably from extended breeding.  2008 The Authors."

Using a laboratory model system, the soil mite Sancassania berlesei, we show that, controlling for egg size, older mothers lay eggs that hatch later, develop more slowly, and mature at larger body sizes. 3. Such differences in life histories lead to marked population dynamical effects lasting for multiple generations, as evidenced by an experiment initiated with similarly sized eggs that came from young or old mothers. Differences in maturation from the initial cohort led to differences in population structure and life history that propagated the initial differences over time. 4.

The thinking was that steroids passively entered the lipophillic yolk during yolk deposition and then were deposited in the yolk until they were passively delivered to the embryo as the yolk was used. Subsequent studies revealed that the system is much more dynamic than that. Here, we explore questions about how dynamic the system really is and look at questions like: Is transfer of maternal steroids to the yolk passive or is it actively regulated At what stages of the maternal reproductive cycle are steroids transferred During reproduction, how dynamic are the levels of yolk steroids Especially in the case of potentially deleterious steroids (e.g., androgens in female offspring; glucocorticoids), once deposited can they come out of the yolk over time Can they be metabolized by the yolk or by the embryo During incubation, how much do steroid levels in the yolk change Can steroids diffuse from the yolk to the embryo prior to yolk utilization Does the embryo contribute to yolk steroid levels as it develops We believe that comprehensive answers to questions like these will eventually allow us to generate a much more accurate and complete model of the transfer and utilization of yolk steroids and that this model will be much more dynamic and active than the one initially proposed."

We documented the effects of body condition on plasma testosterone (T) and corticosterone (CORT)steroids with frequently opposing effectsin breeding females and on the T and CORT content of their eggs. We chose to manipulate body condition via diet because resource availability is a relevant, fluctuating variable in the environment to which females can be expected to respond. Field-collected females were housed in the laboratory and kept on either a reduced, standard, or enhanced diet (differing in nutritional quality and/or quantity) for ten weeks. Although females did not differ in body condition at the beginning of the study, we found these diet regimes effective in producing females that differed in condition by the end of the study. Females on diets of enhanced quality were in better condition, produced more, but not heavier, eggs, and had higher plasma T concentrations than did females on a standard diet or one of reduced quality. There was also a significant positive relationship between laying sequence of eggs and yolk T for females on diets of enhanced quality, but not for the females on diets of standard or reduced quality. There were no effects of quality of diet on CORT in plasma or yolk, but yolk T and yolk CORT exhibited a strong positive correlation irrespective of treatment. Females on diets of reduced quality did not differ from females on standard diets either with respect to reproductive output or to endocrine profiles, in spite of being in worse body condition. These results demonstrate that females' body condition, physiology, and reproductive output can be manipulated by quality of diet, and that changes in deposition of yolk steroids in response to diet may be minimal."

Results indicate that exogenous estradiol is converted to a water-soluble form during the first 15 days of development, concurrent with an increase of sulfotransferase activity in the yolk and extra-embryonic membranes. Based on these data, we propose a mechanistic model based upon the sulfotransferase/sulfatase pathway as a means through which developing eggs can convert steroids to a water-soluble form that can be transported to the embryo. These sulfonated steroids may then serve as precursors for subsequent steroid production via sulfatase activity. This model utilizes a mechanism known to be important for the modulation of maternal steroid signals in placental mammals, at the same time addressing several previously unanswered questions regarding the mechanisms underlying the effects of yolk steroids."

Research in laboratory mammals has suggested that maternally-induced stress can cause significant variation in the responsiveness of an offspring's HPA axis involving both pre- and post-natal developmental mechanisms. However, very little is known regarding effects of maternal stress on the variability of offspring adrenocortical functioning in free-living vertebrates. Here we use an experimental approach that independently lowers the quality of both the pre- and post-natal developmental environment to examine programming and plasticity in the responsiveness of the HPA axis in fledglings of a free-living passerine, the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris). We found that mimicking a hormonal signal of poor maternal condition via an experimental pre-natal increase in yolk corticosterone decreased the subsequent responsiveness of the HPA axis in fledglings. Conversely, decreasing the quality of the post-natal developmental environment (by decreasing maternal provisioning capability via a maternal feather-clipping manipulation) increased subsequent responsiveness of the HPA axis in fledglings, apparently through direct effects on nestling body condition. The plasticity of these responses was sex-specific with smaller female offspring showing the largest increase in HPA reactivity. We suggest that pre-natal, corticosterone-induced, plasticity in the HPA axis may be a 'predictive adaptive response' (PAR): a form of adaptive developmental plasticity where the advantage of the induced phenotype is manifested in a future life-history stage. Further, we introduce a new term to define the condition-driven post-natal plasticity of the HPA axis to an unpredictable post-natal environment, namely a 'reactive adaptive response' (RAR). This study confirms that the quality of both the pre- and post-natal developmental environment can be a significant source of variation in the responsiveness of the HPA axis, and provides a frame-work for examining ecologically-relevant sources of stress-induced programming and plasticity in this endocrine system in a free-living vertebrate, respectively.  2008 Elsevier Inc.

To help address the ensuing question of what prevents selection from favoring higher levels of T in male juncos, we manipulated T in female juncos. A previous study demonstrated no effect of experimentally elevated T on female incubation behavior, suggesting that female parental behavior might be insensitive to T. In this study we asked whether experimentally elevated T mediates other female parental behaviors and whether variation in T-mediated parental behavior might influence reproductive success. We videotaped free-living control- and T-females during nesting to quantify brooding behavior when young were 3days old and provisioning behavior when young were 6days old. Nest defense was measured by quantifying responses to a mounted predator placed near the nest. Reproductive success was assessed via fecundity, nestling quality, and nest survival. T-females spent less time than control females brooding but did not differ in provisioning rate. T-females performed fewer dives at the predator mount and, unlike controls, failed to increase defense as nesting progressed. T-females also had lower daily nest survival and lower nest success (odds of producing at least one fledgling). We conclude that some aspects of female parental behavior are sensitive to experimentally elevated T while others are not and consider the implications for the evolution of T-mediated characters in both sexes.  2008 Elsevier Inc.

The fitness consequences of parental effects at evolutionary equilibrium will depend on how conflicts can be resolved by modifications of developmental processes, suggesting that proximate studies of development can inform ultimate questions.

Maternal effects have been suggested to function as a mechanism for transgenerational plasticity, in which the environment experienced by the mother is translated into the phenotype of the offspring. In birds and other oviparous vertebrates where early development is within the egg, mothers may be able to improve the viability prospects of their offspring at hatching by priming eggs with immunological and nutritional components. 2. We studied how resource availability affects maternal investment in offspring by feeding Ural owl (Strix uralensis, Pall.) females prior to egg-laying in 3 years of dramatically different natural food conditions. 3. Supplementary feeding prior to laying increased body mass and the level of Igs of females measured at clutch completion. Supplementary fed Ural owl females laid larger eggs than control females, and had offspring with higher levels of Igs at hatching compared to offspring of control females. 4. We found variation in maternal allocation of resources to the eggs in response to environmental conditions: during a year of rapidly declining food abundance, maternal Igs in hatchlings were higher, whereas egg size was smaller compared to years with a more stable food supply. 5. Egg size had a positive effect on offspring body mass at fledging, whereas Igs at hatching did not affect Igs at fledging. 6. We conclude that maternal body condition and maternal Igs, as well as hatchling Igs and egg size are limited by food resources during egg production. Hatchlings rely on maternally derived Igs and, hence, our results suggest that mothers with high levels of Igs passively transfer higher Igs levels to their eggs instead of active manipulation of Igs levels in eggs. Ural owl egg size appears to be highly sensitive to short-term changes in food abundance, with important consequences for nestling growth.  2008 The Authors."

In species where the sexes differ in size or other phenotypic traits, they may also have different optimal developmental rates. This influences both parental sex allocation strategies and susceptibility of the sexes to early developmental conditions. However, sex differences in developmental rate and vulnerability to environment during the embryonic period are not well understood. In birds, sibling competition and hatching asynchrony may select for accelerated embryonic development of the last offspring in order to reduce their competitive disadvantage after hatching. They may advance their hatching in response to vocal stimuli by the older siblings. It is, however, unclear whether this flexibility in developmental rates is sex specific. In this study, we experimentally manipulated between-embryo contact and tested whether this affected the pre-natal developmental rate and post-hatching performance of male and female offspring from last-laid eggs in the herring gull. Post-hatching performance was measured both in competitive and non-competitive situations. Among young incubated in isolation, males hatched faster than females, but both sexes fledged in similar, relatively good condition. Among young incubated with normal between-embryo contact, hatching time did not differ between sexes, but males fledged in poorer condition than females, regardless of whether they were reared singly or in a brood. These results suggest that male and female offspring differ in their ability to mitigate the costs of hatching asynchrony.  2008 Springer-Verlag."

However, studies manipulating both the amount of maternal pre-hatching resources and the harshness of post-hatching environment have seldom been performed to date. In this experimental study of Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica) nestlings, we tested the consequences of a reduction in the albumen content of the eggs for fitness-related offspring traits, while performing an unbalanced partial cross-fostering soon after hatching, either increasing or decreasing brood size by one nestling. By molecular sexing of the chicks, we additionally tested for sex-specific sensitivity of individual nestlings to experimental treatments and to sex ratio variation in nestmates. We predicted that chicks hatching from albumen-deprived eggs should suffer more than control chicks from the harsher rearing conditions of enlarged broods. However, although albumen removal depressed chick body mass, chicks hatching from control eggs did not fare better than those hatching from eggs with reduced albumen content in enlarged vs. reduced broods. Albumen removal had sex-specific effects on immunity, with males, but not females, hatching from eggs with reduced albumen content showing a lower T-cell-mediated immune response than controls, suggesting that the two sexes were differentially susceptible to resource deprivation during early ontogeny. In addition, both immune response and chick body mass at age 7 days, when maximum growth rate is attained, declined with an increasing proportion of male nestmates. The effect of brood size manipulation on chick body mass at age 12 days, when peak body mass is attained, was also found to depend on brood sex composition, in that an increase in the proportion of male nestmates depressed offspring body mass in reduced broods, while the reverse was true in enlarged broods. On the whole, these findings suggest that sex differences may exist in environmental sensitivity and patterns of resource allocation among different body functions, and that brood size variation and sex composition may affect offspring fitness-related traits.  2008 by the Ecological Society of America."

Females should therefore prevent prospecting females from settling on the territory. We studied the male and female behavioral and hormonal responses to simulated female territorial intrusions in free-living bluethroats during the pre-laying period. In the study population, polygyny occurs with potential fitness costs for the resident female. We recorded different aspects of aggressive behavior before and after presentation of a live female decoy and playback of female song. These behaviors were compared with a set of intrusions using a male decoy. At the end of a trial, the birds were captured, and blood samples were analyzed for androstenedione, testosterone, estradiol and corticosterone. During the pre-intrusion period, none of the females were observed. Females generally responded strongly to the female decoy by increased flight rate, vocalizations, and by conspicuous perching. Nearly half of the males displayed to the female decoy but never while the resident female was present. We suggest that resident female aggression in bluethroats prevents courtship by her mate and signals her mating status to the female intruder. Female aggression could therefore prevent additional females to settle on the territory and shape the mating system. Females that responded with song had higher levels of estradiol. These findings suggest that estradiol may support aggression in breeding female birds.  2008 Springer-Verlag."

It has been proposed that the dynamics of female testosterone may represent a correlated response to selection acting on male testosterone. However, several costs and benefits of enhancing the circulating levels of testosterone in females have been documented in a number of species, suggesting that female testosterone may be the product of direct selection. Despite this, no study has tried to quantify the long-term fitness consequences of manipulating female testosterone. We report the results of an experiment in which we implanted females with testosterone (T-females) and recorded the consequences of this manipulation on investment and reproductive success throughout their lifetime in relation to control females (C-females). Our results show that T-females bred more years in the colony than C-females. The onset of laying was delayed in T-females compared with C-females, but this effect decreased in the years following manipulation. The T-females laid fewer eggs per year, but eggs were heavier than those laid by C-females. The T-females fed nestlings at a lower rate than C-females in the 3 years in which feeding rates were measured and raised fewer fledglings than C-females in the manipulation year. However, since T-females accomplished more breeding attempts than C-females, as a result of their longer stay in the colony, there were no significant differences between the lifetime reproductive success of T- and C-females. There were no overall differences in body size of nestlings raised by T- and C-females, but the body mass of fledglings reached a peak 2-3 years after manipulation for C-females, a tendency not recorded in offspring of T-females. Also, young that were fledged in broods of C-females tended to recruit into the study colony more frequently than those fledged in T-females' nests. All these results indicate that our testosterone manipulation improved the ability of females to acquire and maintain a breeding site but interfered with their reproductive biology and parental investment. Thus, our main conclusion is that under the ecological conditions of our experiment, the addition of exogenous testosterone reduced female fitness. However, differences in population density and female-female competition are likely to alter the fitness landscape of this trait and change the adaptiveness of increased testosterone as a component of female reproductive strategies.  2008 by The University of Chicago.

In this study, we measured the blue-green chroma of collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis eggs, and investigated the associations between egg colour and parental characteristics, laying date, clutch size and laying order. We also analysed the possible correlations between egg size, yolk carotenoid and antibody levels and eggshell pigmentation. Our results revealed no significant relationships between egg colour and female age, morphological and serological variables. Blue-green colour intensity of eggs increased throughout the breeding season, which could be the result of either a proximate constraint or an adaptive strategy. We found a positive association between egg colour saturation and yolk lutein concentration. This relationship could be the result of the seasonal improvement of caterpillar supply, which could influence the deposition of both components into the egg. Furthermore, we found that females mated to lower-quality males produced eggs with higher biliverdin pigmentation. It is possible that deposition of biliverdin is correlated to some unmeasured aspect of egg quality that could enhance the viability of offspring of lower-quality fathers. We found that intensity of blue-green coloration increased with laying order between the first and fifth eggs."

Here we compare these organizational effects of perinatal androgens in closely related Nazca (Sula granti) and blue-footed (S. nebouxii) boobies that differ in neonatal social system. The older of two Nazca booby hatchlings unconditionally attacks and ejects the younger from the nest within days of hatching, while blue-footed booby neonates lack lethal aggression. Both Nazca booby chicks facultatively upregulate testosterone (T) during fights, motivating the prediction that baseline androgen levels differ between obligately siblicidal and other species. Methodology/Principal Findings: We show that obligately siblicidal Nazca boobies hatch with higher circulating androgen levels than do facultatively siblicidal blue-footed boobies, providing comparative evidence of the role of androgens in sociality. Although androgens confer a short-term benefit of increased aggression to Nazca booby neonates, exposure to elevated androgen levels during this sensitive period in development can also induce long-term organizational effects on behavior or morphology. Adult Nazca boobies show evidence of organizational effects of early androgen exposure in aberrant adult behavior: they visit unattended non-familial chicks in the colony and direct mixtures of aggression, affiliative, and sexual behavior toward them. In a longitudinal analysis, we found that the most active Non-parental Adult Visitors (NAVs) were those with a history of siblicidal behavior as a neonate, suggesting that the tendency to show social interest in chicks is programmed, in part, by the high perinatal androgens associated with obligate siblicide. Data from closely related blue-footed boobies provide comparative support for this interpretation. Lacking obligate siblicide, they hatch with a corresponding low androgen level, and blue-footed booby adults show a much lower frequency of NAV behavior and a lower probability of behaving aggressively during NAV interactions. This species difference in adult social behavior appears to have roots in both pleiotropic and experiential effects of nestling social system. Conclusions/Significance: Our results indicate that Nazca boobies experience life-long consequences of androgenic preparation for an early battle to the death.  2008 Muller et al."

Selection thus favours mechanisms that allow females to elicit a higher paternal investment from their partners. In oviparous species, the allocation of maternal yolk androgens to the eggs might represent such a female adaptation to sexually antagonistic selection. To test this hypothesis, we experimentally blocked the effects of maternal yolk androgens by an injection of the antiandrogen flutamide or a control substance in the eggs of great tits, Parus major. We subsequently manipulated the food demand of the brood in a brood size manipulation experiment, and recorded the parental feeding rates. The males' food-provisioning rates were not significantly influenced by the actions of maternal yolk androgens, whereas females adjusted their parental effort to androgen-mediated nestling signals, in particular in enlarged broods. These results show that female great tits do not exploit the male's contribution to parental care by allocating high concentrations of yolk androgens to their eggs. However, they indicate that variation in yolk androgen allocation among females has evolved through a process of coadaptation that matches maternal food provisioning and offspring demand.  2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

The first studies on the functional consequences of maternal yolk androgens have focused on early life stages and their role in sibling competition. However, recent longitudinal studies reported long-lasting effects of maternal yolk androgens on offspring phenotype, mostly concerning traits that are sensitive to androgens. This suggests that maternal yolk androgens could play an important role in sexual selection, since the expression of many male sexual characters is testosterone-dependent. Using male canaries as a model, we examined the consequences of an experimental elevation of yolk testosterone concentrations on early development as well as long-lasting effects particularly on song, which is one of the most important sexual characters in male songbirds. Elevated yolk testosterone concentrations inhibited male growth, possibly in interaction with an existent ectoparasite exposure. Males hatched from testosterone-treated eggs (T-males) did not have enhanced competitive skills, in contrast to previous studies. The elevation of yolk testosterone concentrations delayed song development but did not affect adult song phenotype. This is intriguing, as yolk testosterone possibly induced developmental stress, which is known to reduce song quality. We hypothesize that yolk testosterone has either no direct effect on adult song phenotype, or that positive effects are merged by the negative effects of developmental stress. Finally, females mated with T-males invested more in their clutch indicating that females either assess T-males as more attractive (differential allocation hypothesis) or compensated for lower offspring viability (compensation hypothesis).  2008 Elsevier Inc.

Given that yolk steroids can significantly affect offspring phenotype and that in many species the levels of yolk steroids have been found to increase with laying order, the maternal transfer of steroids to egg yolk has been proposed as a mechanism for females to offset the deleterious effects of ASH. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether yolk steroids varied with laying order or clutch size in Common Grackles (Quiscalus quiscula). Because ASH varies with clutch size (hatching span averages 48 h in five-egg clutches, 24 h in four-egg clutches) and regularly results in the starvation of later hatched nestlings, we predicted: (1) testosterone and 17-estradiol levels should increase with laying order in both clutch sizes to mitigate the negative effects of ASH on last-hatched nestlings, and (2) the increase should be greater in five-egg clutches due to more pronounced hatching asynchrony. Using a competitive-binding steroid radioimmunoassay, we found no systematic variation in either testosterone or estradiol levels relative to laying order or clutch size. In the absence of evidence that yolk steroids interact adaptively with ASH, research must look elsewhere for potential benefits that might compensate for the costs these steroids impose on nestlings.

Almost all these studies focus on the function of maternal steroid hormones for offspring development, but lack of knowledge about the underlying mechanisms hampers further progress. We discuss several hypotheses concerning these mechanisms, point out their relevance for ecological and evolutionary interpretations, and review the relevant data. We first examine whether maternal hormones can accumulate in the egg independently of changes in hormone concentrations in the maternal circulation. This is important for Darwinian selection and female physiological trade-offs, and possible mechanisms for hormone accumulation in the egg, which may differ among hormones, are reviewed. Although independent regulation of plasma and yolk concentrations of hormones is conceivable, the data are as yet inconclusive for ovarian hormones. Next, we discuss embryonic utilization of maternal steroids, since enzyme and receptor systems in the embryo may have coevolved with maternal effect mechanisms in the mother. We consider dose-response relationships and action pathways of androgens and argue that these considerations may help to explain the apparent lack of interference of maternal steroids with sexual differentiation. Finally, we discuss mechanisms underlying the pleiotropic actions of maternal steroids, since linked effects may influence the coevolution of parent and offspring traits, owing to their role in the mediation of physiological trade-offs. Possible mechanisms here are interactions with other hormonal systems in the embryo. We urge endocrinologists to embark on suggested mechanistic studies and behavioural ecologists to adjust their interpretations to accommodate the current knowledge of mechanisms.  2007 The Royal Society."

The latter encompasses not just the current environment, but also indirect, and sometimes lagged, components that result from environmental effects on its parents that are transmitted to their developing offspring in various ways and at various stages. These environmental effects can simply constrain development, for example, where poor maternal condition gives rise to poorly provisioned, low-quality offspring. However, it is also possible that environmental circumstances during development shape the offspring phenotype in such a way as to better prepare it for the environmental conditions it is most likely to encounter during its life. Studying the extent to which direct and indirect developmental responses to environmental effects are adaptive requires clear elucidation of hypotheses and careful experimental manipulations. In this paper, I outline how the different paradigms applied in this field relate to each other, the main predictions that they produce and the kinds of experimental data needed to distinguish among competing hypotheses. I focus on birds in particular, but the theories discussed are not taxon specific.

Parents, mothers in particular, may influence incubation periods and resulting offspring quality through proximate pathways, while variation in maternal strategies among species can result from selection by adult and offspring mortality. Parents of long-lived species, as is common in the tropics and subtropics, may be under selection to minimize costs to themselves during incubation. Indeed, time spent incubating is often lower in the tropical and subtropical species than the related north temperate species, causing cooler average egg temperatures in the southern regions. Decreased egg temperatures result in longer incubation periods and reflect a cost imposed on offspring by parents because energy cost to the embryo and risk of offspring predation are both increased. Mothers may adjust egg size and constituents as a means to partially offset such costs. For example, reduced androgen concentrations in egg yolks may slow development rates, but may enhance offspring quality through physiological trade-offs that may be particularly beneficial in longer-lived species, as in the tropics and subtropics. We provide initial data to show that yolks of tropical birds contain substantially lower concentrations of growth-promoting androgens than north temperate relatives. Thus, maternal (and parental) effects on embryonic development rates may include contrasting and complementary proximate influences on offspring quality and deserve further field study among species.  2007 The Royal Society."

Despite the expectation that genetic sex determination should not produce consistent bias in primary sex ratios, extensive and adaptive modifications of offspring sex ratio in relation to social and physiological conditions during reproduction are often documented. Such discordance emphasizes the need for empirical investigation of the proximate mechanisms for modifying primary sex ratios, and suggests epigenetic effects on sex-determining mechanisms as the most likely candidates. Birds, in particular, are thought to have an unusually direct opportunity to modify offspring sex ratio because avian females are heterogametic and because the sex-determining division in avian meiosis occurs prior to ovulation and fertilization. However, despite evidence of strong epigenetic effects on sex determination in pre-ovulatory avian oocytes, the mechanisms behind such effects remain elusive. Our review of molecular and cytological mechanisms of avian meiosis uncovers a multitude of potential targets for selection on biased segregation of sex chromosomes, which may reflect the diversity of mechanisms and levels on which such selection operates in birds. Our findings indicate that pronounced differences between sex chromosomes in size, shape, size of protein bodies, alignment at the meiotic plate, microtubule attachment and epigenetic markings should commonly produce biased segregation of sex chromosomes as the default state, with secondary evolution of compensatory mechanisms necessary to maintain unbiased meiosis. We suggest that it is the epigenetic effects that modify such compensatory mechanisms that enable context-dependent and precise adjustment of primary sex ratio in birds. Furthermore, we highlight the features of avian meiosis that can be influenced by maternal hormones in response to environmental stimuli and may account for the precise and adaptive patterns of offspring sex ratio adjustment observed in some species.  2007 The Royal Society."

Moreover, in many seasonally breeding vertebrates, male plasma T levels typically show a pronounced peak during the breeding season. While such population-level patterns are fairly well worked out, the sources and the implications of the large variability in individual T levels within the seasonal cycle remain surprisingly little understood. Understanding the potential sources of individual variation in T levels is important for behavioural and evolutionary ecologists, for at least two reasons. First, in 'honest signalling' theory, T is hypothesized to play a critical role as the assumed factor that enforces honesty of the expression of sexually selected quality indicators. Second, T is often considered a key mediator of central life-history trade-offs, such as investment in survival versus reproduction or in mating versus parental care. Here, we discuss the patterns of within- and between-individual variation in male plasma T levels in free-living populations of birds. We argue that it is unclear whether this variability mainly reflects differences in underlying individual quality (intrinsic factors such as genetic or maternal effects) or in the environment (extrinsic factors including time of day, individual territorial status and past experience). Research in avian behavioural endocrinology has mainly focused on the effects of extrinsic factors, while other sources of variance are often ignored. We suggest that studies that use an integrative approach and investigate the relative importance of all potential sources of variation are essential for the interpretation of data on individual plasma T levels.  2007 The Royal Society."

Carotenoids on the other hand are suggested to be beneficial because they can counteract the oxidative stress and the immune-depressive effect of T. In this study we analyzed the effect of prenatal T exposure in the grey partridge. We injected eggs with three doses of T (high, intermediate, and physiological). After hatching, chicks exposed to a prenatal high dose of T were fed with two diets (rich or poor) differing in -carotene content. We found a significant effect of T on both chick growth and cell-mediated immunity, with high T doses resulting in detrimental effects while low doses were beneficial. Detrimental effects of the high dose of T on immunity were mitigated by -carotene consumed in the diet. The differences between groups were observed in the early period of life (age 10 days for mass, and age 10 and 21 days for immunity), and disappeared in the following period, and up to 1 and 2 years later. Overall, our observations show that T in the egg is not detrimental but beneficial, and that negative effects are found only at supraphysiological concentrations. The negative effects of T on immunity could be balanced if chicks could consume a diet rich in -carotene.  2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

One of the primary axes of life-history variation involves the proportion of embryonic development for which the offspring is retained within its parent's body; understanding trade-offs associated with prolonging that period thus is a critical challenge for evolutionary ecology. 2. Prior to oviposition, most oviparous squamate reptiles retain developing eggs in utero for about one-third of embryogenesis; the strong conservatism in this trait is a major puzzle in reptilian reproduction. To clarify fitness consequences of this prolonged uterine retention, we need to experimentally modify the trait and examine the effects of our manipulation. 3. We used transdermal application of corticosterone to induce gravid scincid lizards (Bassiana duperreyi) to lay their eggs 'prematurely', with relatively undeveloped embryos. Corticosterone application induced females to oviposit sooner (mean of 5.41  0.51 days post-treatment) at earlier embryonic developmental stage (27  0.21) than did controls (13.2  1.22 days; embryonic stage 30.4  0.16). 4. Corticosterone levels in the egg yolk were unaffected by maternal treatment, so effects of earlier oviposition should not be confounded by endocrine disruption of embryogenesis. Nonetheless, early oviposition reduced hatchling fitness. Hatching success was lower, incubation periods post-laying were increased, and neonates from eggs laid at earlier embryonic stages were smaller and slower. 5. These results suggest that retention of developing eggs in utero by oviparous squamates enhances maternal fitness, and does so via modifications to offspring phenotypes rather than (for example) due to accelerated developmental rates of eggs in utero compared to in the nest. 6. More generally, our data support optimality models that interpret interspecific variation in the duration of maternal-offspring contact in terms of the selective forces that result from earlier vs. later termination of that maternal investment.  2008 The Authors."

Especially in larger groups, laying hens often develop damaging behaviours, such as feather pecking and cannibalism, leading to impaired animal welfare. We hypothesise that the propensity to develop feather pecking and cannibalism is affected by a bird's genetic background and by its early-life history. The genetic background can be influenced by genetic selection. Laying hens are traditionally selected on individual performance, which may lead to co-selection of feather pecking and cannibalism. For hens kept in small groups, it has recently been demonstrated that a novel group selection method, focusing on group performance, can help to reduce cannibalism. However, the biological background behind the success of group selection is unknown. It is also not known whether these results from small groups can be translated to larger groups of laying hens. Regarding early-life history, laying, brooding and rearing conditions have been shown to have major effects on behavioural development and on feather pecking and cannibalism. The presence of a hen during rearing has been shown to improve foraging- and social behaviour, to decrease feather pecking and to decrease fearfulness in chicks. Applying group selection and rearing laying hens in a more natural environment may be key factors in solving the problems caused by feather pecking and cannibalism, especially if the promising results of group selection from small groups in experimental settings can be translated to large-group housing systems.  2007 Elsevier B.V.

This competition may lead to mortality, the probability of which may be a function, in part, of the individual offspring's production order. In birds, serial ovulation followed by hatching asynchrony of simultaneous dependents leads to differences in-post-hatching survival that largely depend on ovulation (laying) order. This has led to the widespread assumption that early laid eggs are of greater value and therefore should possess different maternally manipulated characteristics than later-laid eggs. However, this perspective ignores the potential effect of laying order on pre-hatching viability, an effect which some studies suggest should offset the effect of laying order on post-hatching viability, I examined the relationship between laying order and hatching and fledging probability in wild, free-living Lincoln's sparrows (Melospiza lincolnii). In broods with complete hatching success, first-laid-and therefore first-hatched offspring had the highest probability of fledging, and fledging probability declined with increasing laying order. Horwever, first-laid eggs were less likely than later-laid eggs to hatch. This effect of laying order on pre-hatching viability seemed to offset that on post-hatching viability, and consistently, maternal investment in egg size varied little if at all with respect to laying order. These results suggest that ovulation order mediates a trade-off between pre-hatching and post-hatching viability and should encourage a re-evaluation of the solitary role post-embryonic survival often plays when researchers make assumptions about the value of propagules based on the order in which they are produced.  2008 Keith Sockman."

Failure to consider asynchronous hatching (ASH) may have confounded previous analyses. We assessed effects of egg size and ASH on growth and survival of common grackle (Quiscalus quiscula) nestlings to test the hypothesis that females adjust the size of last-laid eggs to modify effects of ASH. Although positive, the effect of egg size on nestling growth and survival was overwhelmed by the effect of ASH, with late-hatched nestlings being most likely to starve. Egg size did significantly affect growth late in the nestling period, but only because starvation had greatly reduced hatching asynchrony among surviving nestlings. Similarly, in experimentally synchronized nests, egg size and hatching asynchrony both affected offspring growth early in the nestling phase. Our results suggest that there is unlikely to be an adaptive advantage to females from varying the size of last-laid eggs in species with substantial ASH and that studies to assess the effect of a given maternal effect (e.g., varying egg size) should be done in the context of other maternal effects that may be operating simultaneously (e.g., ASH).  2008 by The University of Chicago.

Interaction among these components, especially in species where males and females differ in the costs and requirements of growth, limits inference about the evolution of maternal strategies from their expression in the offspring phenotype alone. As an alternative approach, we examine divergence in the proximate mechanisms underlying maternal effects across three house finch populations with contrasting patterns of sex allocation: an ancestral population that shows no sex-biased ovulation, and two recently established populations at the northern and southern boundaries of the species range that have opposite sequences of ovulation of male and female eggs. For each population, we examined how oocyte acquisition of hormones, carotenoids and vitamins was affected by oocyte growth and overlap with the same and opposite sexes. Our results suggest that sex-specific acquisition of maternal resources and sex determination of oocytes are linked in this system. We report that acquisition of testosterone by oocytes that become males was not related to growth duration, but instead covaried with temporal exposure to steroids and overlap with other male oocytes. In female oocytes, testosterone acquisition increased with the duration of growth and overlap with male oocytes, but decreased with overlap with female oocytes. By contrast, acquisition of carotenoids and vitamins was mostly determined by organism-wide partitioning among oocytes and oocyte-specific patterns of testosterone accumulation, and these effects did not differ between the sexes. These results provide important insights into three unresolved phenomena in the evolution of maternal effects - (i) the evolution of sex-specific maternal allocation in species with simultaneously developing neonates of both sexes; (ii) the link between sex determination and sex-specific acquisition of maternal products; and (iii) the evolution of context-dependent modulation of maternal effects.  2008 The Authors."

The concentration of all the main carotenoids (lutein, zeaxanthin, and dehydrolutein) pooled also declined with date and increased with egg mass. We also performed a partial reciprocal cross-fostering of eggs between clutches and investigated the covariation between morphology, T cell-mediated immunity, and plasma carotenoid concentrations of the chicks and carotenoid concentrations in their original eggs. Absolute plasma carotenoid concentrations did not covary with those in the yolk, whereas a positive covariation was found for relative concentrations. Yolk and absolute plasma carotenoid concentrations positively predicted chick body mass and size but not the intensity of the cell-mediated immune response. Thus, yolk carotenoid concentrations may affect chick carotenoid profile and growth, possibly mediating early maternal effects. However, rearing conditions also contributed to determining relative concentrations of circulating carotenoids. Since yolk or plasma antioxidant capacity did not correlate with carotenoid concentrations, future studies of maternal effects mediated by antioxidants should integrate information on carotenoids with information on other components of the antioxidant systems.  2008 by The University of Chicago.

The parental favoritism hypothesis predicts that egg mass, yolk mass and yolk androgens should decline with laying order less in the blue-footed booby than in the brown booby, to promote the survival of the former's junior chick. The eggs of the blue-footed booby had higher yolk concentrations of 5-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and lower concentrations of testosterone (T); both species had similarly high yolk concentrations of androstenedione (A). Intra-clutch variation in yolk DHT, T and A failed to support our predictions. In both species, first and second eggs showed similar concentrations of all three hormones and were of similar size, although in the blue-footed booby (only) yolk masses declined with laying order. Brown booby mothers make junior chicks vulnerable to siblicide by hatching them 5 d after their broodmates, but not by differential allocation of egg androgens or nutrients. Blue-footed booby mothers appear to prepare junior chicks for thriving in a subordinate non-provocative role by hatching them 4 d after their broodmates and providing them with 10% less yolk.

However, the proposed mechanisms of steroid effects are thought to differ between TSD and GSD: a direct effect of oestrogens on gonad feminisation in TSD species vs a differential induction of male-producing or female-producing gametes in GSD species. Geckos offer an ideal opportunity for testing these suggested mechanisms. Closely related gecko species differ in their modes of sex determination. They lay clutches of two synchronously formed eggs; both eggs share equal steroid levels. If identical hormonal composition and environment during vitellogenesis, gravidity and incubation determine the sex of the progeny, siblings should share the same gender in both TSD and GSD geckos. We found strong support for this prediction in a TSD gecko species. Among clutches that were incubated at the temperature that produced both sexes, there were no clutches with siblings of the opposite sex. On the other hand, about half of the clutches yielded siblings of the opposite sex in four GSD species. These results suggest that sex-determining systems constrain the ability of the female to produce single-sex siblings and, hence, it seems that the GSD mechanism constrains the opportunities for sex ratio manipulation in geckos via yolk steroid manipulation.  2007 Springer-Verlag."

However, the predicted negative relationship appeared after incubation when young with many siblings were on average lighter than conspecifics in nests with fewer young. Such a pattern might be generated by differences in hatching success and energy consumption by developing embryos among particular nests. Our data indicate that females which had laid clutches containing many big eggs lost a much larger amount of energy invested and, moreover, produced hatchlings of relatively lower body mass if compared with females having few small eggs.

In three different experiments, we allowed females to choose between males that had been raised in different experimental brood sizes.

Testosterone is present in both sexes and implanting it can provoke a rise of individual aggressiveness leading consequently to an increase of social status. Many researchers have studied the relationship between plasma testosterone and dominance but few have focused on yolk testosterone and social hierarchy. Thus we aimed to study the possible influence of the mother's social status on egg yolk testosterone deposition. Our hypothesis is that dominant females lay eggs containing more testosterone than subordinate females. We recorded the social hierarchy of 24female domesticated canaries, Serinus canaria, and studied the influence of their social status on the concentration of testosterone in their egg yolks and on other egg characteristics. Our results show a significant relationship between a mother's social status and the amount of testosterone deposited in its yolks: the more dominant the females are, the more concentrated in testosterone their eggs are. Our results also show that yolk testosterone increases with laying order, whereas no relationship between mothers' rank number and their clutch size or egg mass was found. We conclude that there is a clear effect of maternal social status on yolk testosterone and discuss dominance inheritance.  2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

Here, we reveal a number of novel aspects of the H+/K+-ATPase module in chick and frog embryos. Maternal H+/K+-ATPase subunits are asymmetrically localized along the left-right, dorso-ventral, and animal-vegetal axes during the first cleavage stages, in a process dependent on cytoskeletal organization. Using a reporter domain fused to molecular motors, we show that the cytoskeleton of the early frog embryo can provide asymmetric, directional information for subcellular transport along all three axes. Moreover, we show that the Kir4.1 potassium channel, while symmetrically expressed in a dynamic fashion during early cleavages, is required for normal LR asymmetry of frog embryos. Thus, Kir4.1 is an ideal candidate for the K+ ion exit path needed to allow the electroneutral H+/K+-ATPase to generate voltage gradients. In the chick embryo, we show that H+/K+-ATPase and Kir4.1 are expressed in the primitive streak, and that the known requirement for H+/K+-ATPase function in chick asymmetry does not function through effects on the circumferential expression pattern of Connexin43. These data provide details crucial for the mechanistic modeling of the physiological events linking subcellular processes to large-scale patterning and suggest a model where the early cytoskeleton sets up asymmetric ion flux along the left-right axis as a system of planar polarity functioning orthogonal to the apical-basal polarity of the early blastomeres.  2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The origin of complex adaptations is one of the most controversial questions in biology. Environmental induction of novel phenotypes, where phenotypic retention of adaptive developmental variation is enabled by organismal complexity and homeostasis, can be a starting point in the evolution of some adaptations, but empirical examples are rare. Comparisons of populations that differ in historical recurrence of environmental induction can offer insight into its evolutionary significance, and recent colonization of North America by the house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus) provides such an opportunity. Results. In both native (southern Arizona) and newly established (northern Montana, 18 generations) populations, breeding female finches exhibit the same complex adaptation - a sex-bias in ovulation sequence - in response to population-specific environmental stimulus of differing recurrence. We document that, in the new population, the adaptation is induced by a novel environment during females' first breeding and is subsequently retained across breeding attempts. In the native population, first-breeding females expressed a precise adaptive response to a recurrent environmental stimulus without environmental induction. We document strong selection on environmental cue recognition in both populations and find that rearrangement of the same proximate mechanism - clustering of oocytes that become males and females - can enable an adaptive response to distinct environmental stimuli. Conclusion. The results show that developmental plasticity induced by novel environmental conditions confers significant fitness advantages to both maternal and offspring generations and might play an important role not only in the successful establishment of this invasive species across the widest ecological range of extant birds, but also can link environmental induction and genetic inheritance in the evolution of novel adaptations.  2008 Badyaev and Oh; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

Two dominant hypotheses about the function of yolk androgens in avian eggs concern maternal manipulation of sibling competition and post hatching paternal care. In megapodes, however, neither sibling competition nor post hatching parental care exists. Eggs are incubated by external heat sources, and chicks dig themselves out of their underground nest and live independently of their parents and their siblings. In this first study on egg androgens of such a megapode, the Australian Brush-turkey Alectura lathami, we found nevertheless substantial amounts of maternal androgens. Since size of the incubation mound, incubation temperature, egg size and laying date greatly vary in this species, we analysed variation in testosterone (T), androstenedione (A4) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in relation to these factors. T concentrations were significantly higher in eggs from bigger mounds and laid at greater depth, which may compensate via anabolic effects for the longer duration and higher energetic requirements of chicks when digging themselves out. T concentrations were higher in smaller eggs, and both yolk A4 and T concentrations increased with laying date, perhaps as a compensatory measure, while DHT concentrations only varied across different mounds. These results indicate that maternal androgens may influence offspring development outside the contexts of sibling competition or parental care.  2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Mothers can therefore increase the survival probability of their young by providing them with passive immunity, e.g. in the form of maternal antibodies transferred via the placenta or the eggs. The maternal responses are only induced when parasites are present, and have been observed not only in vertebrates but also in invertebrates. However, while these parasite-induced maternal effects are known to reduce the harmful effects of common parasites, they may also impose costs for the young, either because the maternal response impairs parental performance, or because maternally transmitted products moderate offspring development. We experimentally tested these two hypotheses in a wild great tit population. We exposed birds to a common ectoparasite before egg-laying to induce the maternal response, and thereafter separated egg-mediated maternal effects from effects on post-laying parental performance by cross-fostering whole clutches. To assess the costs of this response without its confounding benefits, we kept nests free of parasites after hatching. Since the costs of maternal effects can be expressed differently under relaxed and harsh rearing conditions, we simultaneously manipulated clutch size. First, parasite-exposed parents raised lighter young, suggesting that parasite defence or the induced maternal response are costly to the parents and reduce their capacity to raise young. Second, under relaxed but not under harsh rearing conditions, young with the flea-induced maternal effect were heavier and were in better body condition than controls, suggesting that the maternally transferred products can be allocated to physiological functions beyond parasite defence.

In the American kestrel (Falco sparverius), experimental elevation of yolk androgens in the first-laid egg of a clutch (a-egg) to the concentrations found naturally in a clutch's later-laid eggs reduces the growth rate of a-egg nestlings compared to controls. These findings, together with discoveries from other species that the effects of yolk androgens on growth of female nestlings may differ from their effects on growth of male nestlings, raise the hypothesis that natural changes in yolk-androgen concentrations with laying order are ultimately due to a difference between the sexes in their yolk-androgen sensitivity and between early- and late-laid eggs in their sex ratio. By re-analyzing previously published data and adding to the analysis data from previously unanalyzed blood samples used for sex determination, we investigated possible sex-specific effects of yolk-androgens in the context of a potential sex-biased laying order in free-living American kestrels. We used a multi-level, mixed model with a Gompertz function to analyze growth of nestlings hatching from a-eggs that were control-treated or in which we experimentally elevated yolk-androgen concentrations shortly after laying to the higher concentrations naturally found in later-laid eggs. We discovered that male nestlings were more susceptible than female nestlings to growth inhibition by yolk-androgen elevation but did not find a bias in sex ratio with respect to laying order. Together, these findings do not support the above hypothesis. However, they are consistent with the hypothesis that sex differences in yolk-androgen sensitivity enable mothers to economically tune reproductive effort to an individual offspring's reproductive value, which can vary more for one sex than the other.  2007 Springer-Verlag."

Recently it has been recognized that reproduction itself or the regulatory (hormonal) mechanisms underlying reproduction might result in 'costs' (cf. resource-allocation based mechanisms). As one example, it has been suggested that the decrease in hematocrit observed during egg production in birds might be due to antagonistic pleiotropic effects of estrogens. This could generate costs of reproduction by reducing oxygen-carrying capacity during subsequent aerobically demanding stages such as chick-provisioning. Here we show that the reduction in hematocrit during egg-laying is dependent on receptor-mediated actions of endogenous estrogens: blocking estrogen receptors using the anti-estrogen tamoxifen reduces the decrease in hematocrit during egg production in female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) such that hematocrit at the 1-egg stage is not significantly different than pre-breeding, baseline values. We also show that both pre-breeding hematocrit and the decrease in hematocrit associated with egg production are repeatable, and that females with the highest pre-breeding hematocrit values tend to show the largest decreases in hematocrit during egg production. We suggest that hematological changes during egg production are a good candidate mechanism for a regulatory-network based trade-off involving antagonistic pleiotropic effects of estrogens, which otherwise have essential reproductive functions."

Small birds, for example, are often kept as pets and used in a wide variety of behavioural and physiological experiments where 'best' housing conditions are based on advice from experienced keepers as opposed to being tested experimentally. We investigated the effects of two husbandry conditions on the welfare of captive zebra finches: a) optional cover and b) rewarded handling versus random rewards. As a correlate of welfare in the four conditions (cover + reward, cover, reward, nothing), we recorded the time to settle and perform normal behaviours after an experimenter entered the room throughout the study (ie habituation to disturbance). In addition, we measured female preference for males in the four conditions to see whether welfare situation affected attractiveness as a mate. Birds in the two conditions where a reward was provided settled most quickly, and their settling time decreased across the study. Birds provided with cover alone become more disturbed by the entry of the experimenter as the study progressed. However, the birds taking longest on average to settle were those in cages with no cover and no reward. Females preferred males in the reward conditions as mates, either due to the fact that these males settled more quickly or because less-stressed males are more attractive in some other way. Thus, rewarding birds after disturbance is an effective and simple way to improve habituation to handling and human presence. In addition, these birds are more attractive to females, implying that males more habituated to captivity may be preferred as mates. Provision of cover may help under certain circumstances, but appears paradoxically to lead to increased fearfulness over time under the conditions studied here.  2008 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare."

For instance, the down-regulation of immunity is a commonly observed phenomenon under stressful conditions. However, physiological mechanisms that regulate resources allocation to growth and immune functions in response to competition for resources, as well as inter-sexual differences in physiological strategies, are still poorly investigated. To partially fill this gap, we first conducted a descriptive study on chicks of the collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto), a species producing two chicks per brood. Our results show that first hatchlings (seniors) were bigger, showed lower baseline corticosterone levels (CORT) and showed a higher cell-mediated immunoresponsiveness (CMI) than late hatchlings (juniors). However, when controlling for body size, only CMI remained weaker in junior chicks suggesting differences in strategies of resource allocation between siblings. Interestingly, CORT in juniors increased with increasing within-brood hierarchy. But, while within-brood variation in CMI followed the opposite pattern of variation in CORT, we found no evidence that inter-individual variation in CMI was directly related to CORT. In addition hatching-rank related differences in body size, CMI and CORT was similar between sexes. To ensure that the lower phenotypic value expressed by juniors was not fully related to a lower quality of the late-laid egg, we experimentally suppressed the competitive stress experienced by juniors by removing the first-laid egg (i.e. the egg normally producing a senior chick). In the absence of their brood mates, juniors were bigger, had lower levels of CORT and showed a higher CMI than juniors raised in two-brood chicks, suggesting that body size, CMI and CORT in juniors were modulated by the competitive stress. Overall, this study suggests that juniors respond to within-brood competition by elevating CORT and down-regulating CMI. In this context, the role of CORT, as a mechanism regulating physiological strategies related to growth and immunocompetence is discussed.  2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

However, recent studies showed that the relation between digit ratio and steroids seems inconsistent and may vary among species and populations. We tested the hypothesis that digit ratios would be correlated with the expression of secondary sexual characters, using the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) as a model system. This was done by testing whether variation in 2D:4D ratio was correlated with tail length and features of song, which are important secondary sexual characters positively correlated with circulating steroid concentration in adult birds. Furthermore, we examined the prediction that male and female digit ratios would correlate with body mass in an antagonistic way. There was no significant sexual dimorphism in digit ratio, which may be due to low levels of sexual selection in this population. Adult right 2D:4D ratio was negatively linked to tail length but not to male song output. Moreover, right 2D:4D ratio was negatively correlated with body mass in male and positively in females.

In birds, the maternal transfer of corticosterone to eggs was recently proposed as a hormonal mechanism by which offspring phenotype is matched to the relative quality of the maternal environment. However, current hypotheses lack supporting information on both intra- and inter-clutch variation in yolk corticosterone for wild birds. As such, we examined variation in yolk corticosterone levels in a wild population of European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). Maternal condition, clutch size and nesting density were all negatively related to yolk corticosterone deposition; females with high condition indices, those laying larger clutches and those nesting in high-density associations deposited lower amounts of the hormone into eggs than those with low condition indices, laying small clutches and nesting in isolation. Alternatively, we found no effects of maternal age or human disturbance on yolk corticosterone deposition. Intra-clutch variation of yolk corticosterone was significant, with levels increasing across the laying sequence in all clutch sizes examined, with the difference between first and last-laid eggs being greater in large versus small clutches. Given the reported effects of yolk corticosterone on offspring size and growth, intra-clutch variation in yolk corticosterone has the potential to alter the competitive environment within a brood. Furthermore, our results indicate that variation in yolk corticosterone can originate from variation in both the mother's quality as well as the quality of her breeding environment. The presence of inter-female variation in particular is an important pre-requisite in testing whether the exposure of offspring to maternally-derived corticosterone is a mechanistic link between offspring phenotypic plasticity and maternal quality.  2007 Elsevier Inc.

First, we found no relationship between concentrations or amounts of yolk androgens and carotenoids. Yolk carotenoids decreased with laying order, whereas we found no relationship between yolk androgens and laying order. Second, we tested the Investment Hypothesis, which predicts that high-quality females or females paired to high quality mates, allocate differentially more of these yolk compounds to their offspring. For carotenoids, we mostly found evidence to counter predictions of the Investment hypothesis: (1) Carotenoid concentrations varied among females, (2) heavier eggs contained lower carotenoid concentrations, although heavier yolks contained greater amounts of carotenoids, (3) eggs of earlier-laying females had lower concentrations in their eggs, and (4) yolk carotenoids were not correlated with clutch size or male plumage ornamentation. For androgens, we found weak support for the Investment Hypothesis: (1) Yolk androgens varied among females, (2) heavier eggs and yolks contained greater amounts, although not concentrations of androgens, (3) females paired to more colorful males laid eggs with greater concentrations of androgens, and (4) no effects of laying date or morphological correlates of female quality on androgen concentrations in egg yolks.

Two groups of Japanese quail, one habituated to humans (H) and a second non-habituated (NH), were exposed daily to brief human disturbances. We analysed egg quality, offspring growth, and offspring emotional reactivity. NH females produced eggs with less androgens (testosterone and androstenedione) and more immunoreactive progesterone compared to birds habituated to humans. NH females produced eggs with less yolk, heavier shell and chicks hatching later and being smaller as compared to habituated individuals. A lower emotional reactivity was found in young of NH females compared to young of H females. Thus, human disturbance of the mother triggered different effects on chick phenotype depending on previous experience of mother birds with humans.

Maternal carotenoids in the egg yolk have been hypothesized to promote maturation of the immune system and protect against free radical damages. Depending on availability, mothers may thus influence offspring quality by depositing variable amounts of carotenoids into the eggs. Sex allocation theory predicts that in good quality environments, females should invest into offspring of the sex that will provide larger fitness return, generally males. 2. In a field experiment we tested whether female great tits bias their investment towards males when carotenoid availability is increased, and whether male offspring of carotenoid-supplemented mothers show higher body condition. We partially cross-fostered hatchlings to disentangle maternal effects from post-hatching effects, and manipulated hen flea Ceratophyllus gallinae infestation to investigate the relationship between carotenoid availability and resistance to ectoparasites. 3. As predicted, we found that carotenoid- supplemented mothers produced males that were heavier than their sisters at hatching, while the reverse was true for control mothers. This suggests that carotenoid availability during egg production affects male and female hatchlings differentially, possibly via a differential allocation to male and female eggs. 4. A main effect of maternal supplementation became visible 14 days after hatching when nestlings hatched from eggs laid by carotenoid-supplemented mothers had gained significantly more mass than control nestlings. Independently of the carotenoid treatment, fleas impaired mass gain of nestlings during the first 9 days in large broods only and reduced tarsus length of male nestlings at an age of 14 days, suggesting a cost to mount a defence against parasites. 5. Overall, our results suggest that pre-laying availability of carotenoids affects nestling condition in a sex-specific way with potentially longer-lasting effects on offspring fitness.  2007 The Authors."

In evolutionary and behavioral ecology, assigning natural and sexual selection a creative and anticipatory role unmasks the need to explicitly consider the link between a trait's functional importance and its inheritance and results in confusion about selection as an adaptive modifier of development versus selection as a passive filter of already produced forms. In developmental genetics, an emphasis on regulatory versus coding aspects of molecular evolutionary change overlooks the fundamental question of the origination of an inherited developmental toolkit and assignment of its regulatory functions. Because maternal effects, by definition, combine developmental induction of functionally important changes and their inheritance, they bridge the origin and evolution of organismal adaptability, at least on short time scales. The explosion of empirical studies of maternal effects raises a question - are maternal effects ubiquitous but short-term adjusters and fine-tuners of an evolved form with only secondary importance for evolutionary change? Or are they a particularly clear example of a stage in a continuum of inheritance systems that accumulates, internalizes, and passes on the most consistent and adaptive organism-environment interactions?

Because most avian studies have focused on multi-egg clutch species, and interpreted results within the framework of sibling competition, we still know little about how yolk androgens might be allocated in direct response to environmental conditions. Most oceanic birds are long-lived and lay single-egg clutches, and their breeding success is tightly linked to highly variable marine production. That combination: a variable breeding environment, long lives, and single-egg clutches, makes oceanic birds good subjects to test hypotheses about yolk androgen allocation strategies. We measured concentrations of two yolk androgens, androstenedione (A4) and testosterone (T), in the single-egg clutches laid by early-laying Cassin's (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) and rhinoceros (Cerorhinca monocerata) auklets at Triangle Island, British Columbia, Canada, in 2002-2004. Environmental conditions including sea-surface temperatures and the timing and intensity of marine primary production varied over the 3 years, and in response, both the timing and success of seabird breeding varied. As in other avian species, concentrations of A4 and T varied markedly among individual eggs in both species (by factors of 3-8), yet contrary to expectation, little of the variation could be attributed to year effects. The high interindividual variation and the lack of interannual variation suggest a non-adaptive explanation for yolk androgen deposition relative to environmental conditions in these species.  2008 Elsevier Inc.

Testosterone (T) levels increased significantly with increasing density. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels increased with the number of nest boxes available. The number of nest boxes monopolized by a breeding male negatively affected androstenedione (A4) levels, positively affected DHT levels and did not affect T levels. Other factors related to social interactions or competition among females (including polygyny) did not influence yolk hormone levels. Within-female yolk androgen levels were highly consistent over two consecutive years even though females were breeding in opposite breeding densities during each year, suggesting that individual characteristics are important determinants of variation in maternal androgen allocation in addition to potential effects of environmental conditions.

Hence, if conditions are good, hosts can tolerate a certain number of parasites without suffering severe effects. In addition, the presence of other parasites can influence the virulence of a focal parasite either positively or negatively. We tested whether an experimental tick infestation reduced nestling performance in Great Tits (Parus major) and whether the effect was altered by a maternal response induced by Hen Fleas (Ceratophyllus gallinae) that is known to protect nestlings against flea infestations (i.e., we tested whether one parasite can alter the virulence of another parasite across host generations). We induced the maternal effect by experimentally infesting half the birds' nests with fleas during egg laying. After hatching, nestlings were cross-fostered into broods that then contained both nestlings with and without the maternal effect. Half of these broods were infested with five tick larvae per nestling. This resulted in tick infestation levels similar to levels found in natural populations. The tick infestation did not affect nestling mass, tarsus length, or time until fledging. Thus, an effect of the flea-induced maternal effect on tick virulence was not detectable. From these results, we concluded that either tick larvae do not affect nestlings, or nestlings or their parents can compensate for the negative consequences of tick infestations in numbers similar to those that occur in nature.  2008 by The American Ornithologists' Union.

As a prenatal stressor social instability was used: we studied male guinea pig offspring whose mothers lived in a stable social environment (SE-sons) or in an unstable social environment during pregnancy (UE-sons). Eight experimental groups were established, consisting of one SE-son, one UE-son and five females, respectively. In all groups females were regularly exchanged to create a situation of social instability. We hypothesised that if mothers prenatally adapt their offspring to an unstable social environment, UE-sons will be dominant, display agonistic and courtship behaviour more frequently, have higher body weights, be less reactive to moderate stressors and have higher testosterone concentrations than SE-sons. Our results revealed no significant differences between SE- and UEsons concerning behaviour, dominance status, body weights, cortisol or testosterone. However, we found differences between dominant and subdominant males. Subdominant males had significantly higher cortisol levels than dominant males, pointing to a higher degree of stress. Regarding testosterone, dominant males had higher testosterone levels directly after the establishment of dominance hierarchies. Thus, these results do not provide evidence that mothers adjust their offspring prenatally to prevailing social conditions. They also do not support the hypothesis that instability of the mother's environment during pregnancy inevitably results in behavioural disorders or pathological endocrine profiles. Rather do the sons' behavioural and endocrine responses later in life reflect typical reactions to socially challenging situations.  2007 Elsevier Inc."

However, to gain an in-depth understanding of how yolk androgens function in an adaptive context, we must first understand the complex entanglement of physiological and endocrine interrelationships that change after exposure to yolk androgens.

Evidence to date suggests that patterns of yolk androgen deposition could provide females with a means to manipulate sibling competition and, thereby, increase their fitness. We examined yolk testosterone (T) concentrations in eggs of the smooth-billed ani (Crotophaga ani) to understand patterns of androgen deposition in eggs of this plural-breeding joint-nesting cooperatively breeding species. We tested the hatching asynchrony adjustment hypothesis, which states that increases in yolk androgen levels over the laying sequence function to mitigate the disadvantage of being a later-hatched chick in species without adaptive brood reduction. We also investigated the effect of group size on yolk T deposition to test the hypothesis that females in multi-female groups could give a competitive edge to their own chicks by depositing higher T levels in their eggs. Predictions of the hatching asynchrony adjustment hypothesis were supported in both single- and multi-female groups as yolk testosterone levels increased from early- to late-laid eggs. This suggests that ani females can influence nestling competition and chick survival by within-clutch differential T allocation. Unexpectedly, we did not observe an effect of group size on yolk T deposition. Yolk testosterone concentrations may not be a mere reflection of a female's hormonal status as female plasma circulating levels of T did not vary in the same direction as yolk T levels. Results of this study therefore support the idea that females may adaptively manipulate chick behavior through hormonal deposition in eggs.  2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

During stress, metabolic alterations often result in the mobilization of energy away from energy-sensitive functions such as growth, which could have significant implications for developing animals. However, little is known about the implications of stress hormones for energy consumption in growing individuals. We experimentally increased corticosterone (CORT) levels in nestling zebra finches via oral administration, between the ages of 7 and 18 days. The standard metabolic rate (SMR) of birds was measured twice overnight when birds were between 11-13 and 55-65 days of age. Developmental CORT administration significantly elevated overnight variability in SMR (sd) in nestling birds (during the treatment period), but not at 55-65 days (5-6 weeks after the treatment period). The effect on variability was seen more prominently in birds from larger brood sizes and in females. We found no effects of our treatments on mean SMR overnight. However, brood size and sex had interactive effects, with males from larger brood sizes having higher SMR at 55-65 days of age. These results suggest that stress hormones can have significant effects on energy metabolism and possibly nocturnal arousal and sleep fragmentation. However, there were no detectable long term effects of our treatments on SMR, suggesting that these effects are only short-lived, in order to maintain homeostasis in the short term.  2008 Elsevier Inc.

There is a rich literature on ARTs in a broad diversity of reptile lineages, and our contribution is therefore not an exhaustive one. Rather, we attempt to cover topics of general significance to many fields of study, including differences in male and female reproductive behavior, sex ratio adjustment and progeny gender manipulation, and the role of parthenogenesis in mating systems. Our goal is to provide a representative portrait of the diversity of tactics displayed among reptilian lineages, but we often illustrate more elaborate points using data from side-blotched lizards, Uta stansburiana, a system that we have been working on together for a decade. Throughout the chapter we emphasize the distinction between the proximate and the ultimate mechanisms that underlie the evolution of alternative tactics. We conclude with a brief discussion of potentially exciting future research directions in reptilian systems. INTRODUCTION Exploring alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) in reptiles presents a great challenge given the diverse nature of these taxa. Modern reptilian lineages are paraphyletic with ancient histories. Some extinct reptilian groups such as the dinosaurs undoubtedly exhibited alternative reproductive tactics, given the documented dichotomy between precocial (Geist and Jones 1996, Varricchio et al. 1997) and altricial young (Horner 2000) in various dinosaur lineages. This dichotomy in the developmental tactics of young is strongly associated with the mating systems in the surviving descendants of dinosaurs, the birds.

However, effects of socio-positive behavior prior to fledging in relation to corticosterone excretion in altricial birds have not been investigated yet. We here monitored corticosterone excretion patterns in three groups of hand raised juvenile ravens (n = 5, 6 and 11) in the nest, post-fledging (May-July) and when ravens would be independent from their parents (September-November). We related these corticosterone excretion patterns to socio-positive behavior. Behavioral data were collected via focal sampling in each developmental period considered. We analyzed amounts of excreted immunoreactive corticosterone metabolites (CM) using enzyme immuno assays. We collected fecal samples in each developmental period considered and evaluated the most appropriate assay via an isolation stress experiment. Basal CM was significantly higher during the nestling period than post-fledging or when birds were independent. The time nestlings spent allopreening correlated negatively with mean CM. Post-fledging, individuals with higher CM levels sat close to (distance < 50cm) conspecifics more frequently and tended to preen them longer. When birds were independent and a stable rank hierarchy was established, dominant individuals were preened significantly longer than subordinates. These patterns observed in ravens parallel those described for primates, which could indicate that animal species living in a complex social environment may deal with social problems in a similar way that is not restricted to mammals or primates.  2007 Elsevier Inc.

I examined consecutive offspring produced by A. carolinensis and A. sagrei from four locations in the southeastern United States over three years under a common garden design in order to identify population and species level variation in patterns of offspring sex independent of maternal and incubation environments. These data do not indicate sequential alternation of offspring sex in either species and allow for rejection of even small deviations from the pattern expected under random production of the sexes. I conclude, therefore, that anole reproduction is not universally constrained to a pattern of sequential alternation of offspring sex and speculate that this pattern is conditionally manifest depending on interactions between stress hormones and fluctuations in parental resources in the form of maternally deposited yolk steroids.  2007 by the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists."

Here we suggest that the focus on the consequences of maternal effects for offspring fitness only and the use of 'snapshot' estimates of fitness have misdirected our effort to understand the evolution of maternal effects. We suggest that selection typically acts on maternal effects to maximise maternal rather than (or in addition to) offspring fitness. We highlight the importance of considering how maternal effects influence maternal fitness across a mother's lifetime and describe four broad types of maternal effects using an outcome-based approach. Overall, we suggest that many maternal effects will have an adaptive basis for mothers, regardless of whether these effects increase or decrease survival or reproductive success of individual offspring.  2007 The Authors."

One mechanism by which the behavioral phenotype of an individual can be shaped is via transmission of maternal sex steroids. In this study, we examined the role of yolk testosterone (T) in controlling neophobia in 9-month-old, sexually mature zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Offspring hatched from either T-treated or control eggs were subjected to a sequential series of behavioral tests in which we measured the neophobic response and its persistence towards two unfamiliar stimuli. Birds from T-treated and control eggs did not differ in their latencies to approach and eat a novel food source during their first encounter. However, egg treatment affected subsequent habituation. Latencies decreased in both groups over a habituation period of 5days, but considerably more so in T-offspring. Although males appeared to approach novel food faster than females, there was no overall sex effect during the habituation period. When a novel object was added in combination with the previously learned food stimulus, this caused an behavioral shift in approach latencies. In males, control offspring had significantly shorter latencies than T-offspring, whereas there was no difference among females. The latency to eat in the same test was not significantly affected by sex or egg treatment. Our results demonstrate long-term effects of prenatal T on neophobic responses in adult zebra finches. We hypothesize that prenatal T may be one underlying mechanism for individual differences routine formation.  2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

We tested whether CORT is immunosuppressive by studying humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in populations of captive zebra finches selected for divergent peak levels of CORT. We also investigated whether selection for peak CORT has an effect on the quality of several sexually selected regions of the male zebra finch; in addition we compared morphometric parameters and the dominance ranking in males from the different selection lines. We also tested whether different components of the immune system compete for limited resources. We found that selection for divergent levels of peak CORT had little effect on humoral immunity, male sexual signal quality or dominance ranking. However, contrary to expectations, we did find a positive relationship between CORT titre and cell-mediated immunity, as well as a greater cell-mediated response in the birds selected for high CORT titre than those selected for low CORT titre. Consistent with predictions, significant negative relationships were found between both testosterone and CORT titre on humoral immunity. Birds from the low CORT lines were significantly larger in terms of skeletal size than those from the high CORT lines. Overall, our results suggest that the cell-mediated immune response is associated with a reduction in the humoral response, but only in males, and that there is no simple relationship between peak CORT levels and immune function."

First-generation laboratory-reared fish showed similar behaviour to their wild parents suggesting that boldness has a heritable component. In addition, repeated chasing with a net increased boldness in both high- and low-predation offspring, showing that boldness is also heavily influenced by life experiences. Differences between males and females were also sustained in the laboratory-reared generation indicating that sex differences in boldness are also heritable.

Accordingly, we tested the effect of embryonic corticosterone exposure (5.5 ng/ml egg) and intermittent handling after hatching on the behaviour and growth of 88 vehicle-treated (40 males and 48 females) and 88 corticosterone-treated (40 males and 48 females) chicks. The injection treatment did not have any significant effects on tonic immobility (P  0.23), but tended to increase the male's willingness to feed in a competitive environment (P  0.10). However, post-hatch handling increased the duration of tonic immobility in corticosterone-treated birds but not in controls (P  0.01), as reflected in the interaction between the injection and handling treatments (P  0.01). Intermittent handling but not corticosterone treatment reduced the willingness of male birds to eat in a competitive situation, but neither treatment affected this behaviour in females.

Sex ratio manipulation occurs in many taxa, but the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon in vertebrates remain largely unknown. Factors favoring skewed sex ratios, such as reduced maternal condition or food availability, also induce elevated corticosteroids. Recent experimental studies support a causal relationship between corticosteroids and sex ratio. Evidence of a natural correlation between maternal corticosteroids and offspring sex ratio has been lacking, however. Without such evidence, the importance of corticosteroids in influencing sex ratios in natural populations was unknown. We measured baseline corticosteroids in 19 free-ranging female white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys) and the sex ratios of their offspring. Females with high corticosteroids produced more daughters than females with low hormone levels. We then conducted a controlled, field-based experiment investigating the effects of moderately increased maternal corticosteroids on offspring sex ratios to determine if the observed correlation reflects a causal relationship between maternal corticosteroids and offspring sex ratio. Hormone-implanted females produced more female embryos than control females. These findings provide the first evidence of a natural correlation between maternal corticosteroids and offspring sex ratios in free-ranging birds, and the first experimental evidence of a causal link between moderate increases in corticosteroids and biased primary sex ratios.

A pilot study confirmed that nestling T levels could be elevated within a natural physiological range using an oral dose of T. After T-dosing, nestling begging behaviour was measured as: i) the duration of begging displays and ii) the maximum height of begging stretches. Our results show that nestling T levels were elevated at 90min post dosing and that at this time point both measures of begging behaviour were performed more intensely by T-dosed nestlings than controls. Nestling begging displays in response to dosing varied between individuals, which in part was explained either by the date in the breeding season or nestling mass.

Given the role carotenoids play in mitigating oxidative stress produced during physical activity and as immunostimulants, one behavioral function on which they may have a significant impact is an individual's capacity to provide parental care. We tested this hypothesis using three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), a species in which males provide obligate and intensive paternal care. Males were fed either high or low (but biologically realistic) levels of carotenoids and monitored throughout incubation, during which we quantified 2 key aspects of parental care: their ability to fan their eggs under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (when both the costs and requirements of fanning increase) and their ability to defend their nest against a simulated conspecific male. High-carotenoid diet males fanned their eggs at a significantly higher rate during hypoxic (but not normoxic) conditions and had higher clutch hatching success than males fed the low-carotenoid diet. There was no evidence that they defended their nest more aggressively. Furthermore, low-carotenoid diet males also appeared to engage in cannibalization of their clutch. These results demonstrate that dietary carotenoid availability can affect a male's ability to provide parental care, and we discuss the potential mechanisms and implications of this finding.

Life-history allocation models typically assume that ""bigger offspring are better"", but field data paint a more complex picture: larger offspring size sometimes enhances fitness, and sometimes not. Additionally, higher survival and faster growth of larger offspring might be due to indirect maternal effects (e.g., mothers allocate hormones or nutrients differently to different-sized eggs), and not to offspring size per se. Alternative factors, such as seasonal timing of hatching, may be more important. We examined these issues using 419 eggs from captive jacky dragon lizards (Amphibolurus muricatus). The mothers were maintained under standardized conditions to minimize variance in thermal and nutritional history, and the eggs were incubated under controlled conditions to minimize variance in offspring phenotypes due to incubation temperature and moisture. We reduced the size of half the eggs (and, thus, the size of the resultant hatchlings) from each clutch by yolk extraction. The hatchlings were marked and released at a field site over a 3-month period, with regular recapture surveys to measure growth and survival under natural conditions. Growth rates and survival were strongly enhanced by early-season hatching, but were not affected by hatchling body size.  2007 Springer-Verlag."

The magnitude and direction of the effects changed among life history stages and years, possibly in association with food supply in some cases, and may indicate a role for balancing selection in the maintenance of personality.  2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS."

Rather than being a rare and intriguing system to study coevolutionary processes, I believe that avian brood parasites and their hosts are much more important as extreme cases in the evolution of life-history strategies.

One plausible non-genetic mechanism that might produce such differences among clutches involves maternal allocation of steroid hormones. Lizard eggs often display considerable inter-clutch variation in the quantities of maternally allocated steroids, and exogenous application of such steroids has been reported to influence the phenotypic traits (especially, sex) of hatchlings. We examined correlations between naturally occurring yolk steroid levels and offspring traits in the scincid lizard Bassiana duperreyi, and also conducted experimental trials (exogenous application of testosterone or 17-oestradiol to eggs) to test for causal effects of hormones. Although exogenous hormones readily reversed sex of the hatchling lizards, no other phenotypic traits of the hatchlings (morphology, locomotor performance) were significantly correlated with naturally occurring levels of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone or estrogen, nor were these phenotypic traits significantly affected by exogenous application of hormones. Hence, our results do not support the hypothesis that reproducing female lizards manipulate the phenotypic traits of their offspring by differential allocation of steroid hormones.

This can partly be explained by the fact that growing to larger size renders the larger sex more vulnerable to food shortage. However, since sibling rivalry is often size-dependent, chicks of the larger sex should have a competitive advantage. This raises the question as to why the larger sex does not always benefit from its size in sibling competition. We studied sibling competition in the black-headed gull (Larus ridibundus), a sexually-size dimorphic species with male-biased mortality. We manipulated the natural brood sex ratio and placed one male chick in direct competition with one female chick while concurrently controlling for differences in age, size and laying order. Male chicks outgrew their female siblings by 15% in asymptotic body mass and did not suffer from enhanced mortality. Female chicks tended to be more alert when the parents returned to the nest and were more persistent in gull-typical begging displays. Females were more likely to get the first food item, but they did not get more food, possibly due to a size-mediated dominance over the non-monopolizable regurgitated food. Thus, it is unlikely that sex differences in competitiveness significantly contribute to male-biased mortality in black-headed gulls. The previously reported male-biased mortality is more likely due to a disadvantage of a higher food demand and a higher sensitivity towards low egg quality, as has been shown in previous studies.

Although it is evident that the earliest developmental stages have large effects on fitness, other developmental stages, such as the period when secondary sexual characters develop, might also exert a profound effect on-fitness components. Here we show experimentally in male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, that nutritional conditions during this later period have immediate effects on male plumage ornaments and on their attractiveness as adults. Males that had received high quality food during the second month of life, a period when secondary sexual characteristics develop, were significantly more attractive as adults in mate choice tests than siblings supplied with standard food during this period. Preferred males that had experienced better nutritional conditions had larger orange cheek patches when nutritional treatments ended than did unpreferred males. Sexual plumage ornaments of young males thus are honest indicators of nutritional conditions during this period. The mate choice tests with adult birds indicate that nutritional conditions during the period of song learning, brain and gonad development, and moult into adult plumage have persisting effects on male attractiveness. This suggests that the developmental period following nutritional dependence from the parents is just as important in affecting adult attractiveness as are much earlier developmental periods. These findings thus contribute to understanding the origin and consequences of environmentally determined fitness components.  2007 Naguib, Nemitz."

However, although variation within clutches in yolk androgens is relatively well understood, the adaptive significance of patterns of variation between clutches remains rather unclear. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that yolk androgens act as a means of an adaptive maternal effect to adjust offspring to a given posthatching environment. Thus, the consequences of maternal yolk androgens for offspring development are likely to depend on the specific environment of a given brood. We experimentally manipulated yolk androgen concentrations in spotless starling eggs, using a between-brood design in which full broods were manipulated applying either an androgen or sham treatment, in order to test the effects of between-brood variation in yolk androgen levels. We also included in the analysis several female characters that have been shown to affect androgen deposition. Androgen-chicks tended to gain more mass, a similar effect to that shown in previous studies where direct competition between chicks belonging to different treatments was allowed, but did not gain a survival benefit. Androgen-chicks had wider beak flanges, an effect that has not been described previously and could play an important role in food acquisition. In addition, androgen-chicks had higher endogenous plasma levels of androgens, which could induce higher begging intensity. We hypothesize that these effects are an important mechanistic link for our understanding of how yolk androgens exert their effects on offspring development after hatching. Contrary to our predictions, we found no evidence that the observed effects depended on the environment under which it was investigated. Because high yolk androgen levels seem to be beneficial for nestlings in this species, we hypothesize that yolk hormone deposition could be costly for females or alternatively that potential negative effects later in adulthood may constrain maternal hormone allocation.

The host-specific egg pattern is thought to be inherited matrilinearly, creating female-only host-specific races. Males are thought not to be adapted to their host and they maintain the species by mating arbitrarily with respect to host specialization of females. However, recent results suggest that male cuckoos may also show host-specific adaptations and these may require assortative mating with respect to host. The calls males produce on the breeding grounds could provide a potential mechanism for assortative mating. We tested whether male cuckoo calls differ more between nearby populations that parasitize different hosts than between distant populations that parasitize the same host. We recorded the calls of geographically distant pairs of populations in Hungary, with each pair consisting of a forest population and a nearby reed bed population. Each habitat is characterized by one main host species for the common cuckoo. Our results show that calls of distant cuckoo populations from the same habitat type are more similar to each other than they are to those of nearby populations from a different habitat. These results suggest that cuckoo calls differ sufficiently to allow recognition of habitat-specific individuals.  2007 The Royal Society."

Mothers are expected to skew their investment depending on the laying order and sex when unequal sibling competition occurs within a brood because of sex-specific vulnerability and age hierarchy caused by asynchronous hatching. The Bengalese finch hatches asynchronously and shows a moderate reversed sexual size dimorphism. However, contrary to commonly accepted assumptions of size-dependent vulnerability, the smaller sex (male) is more vulnerable to developmental stress caused by sibling competition. We investigated whether maternal investment would be biased by the position in laying order and the sex of eggs, and also explored the possible differences in growth patterns depending on sex, laying order, and age hierarchy by observing chicks fostered to experimentally manipulated broods where brood composition was controlled and age hierarchy was more enhanced than in natural breeding conditions. We found that overall patterns of maternal investment favored the disadvantageous sectors of sibling competition, i.e., eggs of later laying order and sons over those of early laying order and daughters. We also examined the effect of laying order on adult body size and sex differences in growth patterns. When reared in the subordinate age hierarchy, females could compensate for the deficit of decreased growth rate by taking longer to mature, whereas males could not. We suggest that this sex-specific growth pattern could be the cause of sex differences in vulnerability to early developmental stress.  2007 Springer-Verlag."

Female parents could allocate more resources to eggs of one sex to compensate potential sex-dependent constraints later during the nestling period. In this study, we tested the influence of environmental conditions on sexual dimorphism in eggs of Eurasian kestrels (Falco tinnunculus) by experimentally manipulating food availability before laying. We found that an increase in food abundance before laying did not increase egg mass but changed sex-dependent resource distribution in eggs. In food-supplemented pairs, but not in control pairs, egg mass and hatchling mass were similar between males and females. In addition, we found, in the food-supplemented group, that the latest hatched females showed shorter hatching times than in the control group. In control pairs, female eggs, hatchlings and nestlings were heavier than males. In addition, male fledglings in the food-supplemented group gained less mass than those in the control group. As that food abundance was only increased until the onset of laying, female kestrels were expected to invest in eggs taking food abundance before egg formation as a predictor of future conditions during brood rearing. Our study shows that environmental conditions before laying promote a subtle adjustment of the resources invested in both sexes of offspring rather than in other breeding parameters. This adjustment resulted in a shortening of hatching time of the last hatched females that possibly gives them advantages in their competitive capacity with respect to male nest-mates.  2007 Springer-Verlag."

Male house sparrows (Passer domesticus) possess a black throat patch often referred to as a ""badge"" or a ""badge of status"". By assuming a trade-off between male attractiveness (reflected in male ornaments) and parental care under the differential allocation hypothesis, we predicted that badge size would be negatively correlated with male parental investment. An experiment in which the badge was enlarged in one group and unchanged in a control group was conducted. Our manipulation was predicted to affect female as well as male parental investment. However, we found that eight variables associated with parental investment-the start date for breeding, clutch size, male and female incubation time, male and female food provisioning rate, and average chick weight and the number of fledglings-barely differed between treatments. Also, little evidence for correlations between natural variation in badge size and any of these eight variables was found. Instead, the start date for breeding and the number of fledglings were significantly correlated with both male and female age, while clutch size increased with female age. Female condition was a positive predictor of clutch size and number of fledglings. Female tarsus length, unexpectedly, is related to both male and female incubation time. Badge size was also positively correlated with male age. However, parental age (male or female) was not related to parental care. We conclude that badge size does not signal parental quality, but that the ages of both sexes and the condition of the female play significant roles in the reproductive performance of this species.  2007 Springer-Verlag."

In side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana), two alternative pathways of dorsal pattern induction involve maternal oestradiol and alleles for throat colouration (social strategy). In one pathway, females increased yolk oestradiol when mated to yellow-throated sires; oestradiol induced dorsal barring in yellow-throated progeny of both sexes. In another pathway, females elevated yolk oestradiol in response to a high frequency of orange alleles in experimental social neighbourhoods. When the sire lacked yellow alleles, this secondary pathway resulted in striped, orange sons and striped, non-orange daughters. All maternally induced types had high fitness in the wild. These results illustrate a (previously undescribed) mechanism for females to simultaneously resolve differing correlational selection pressures on different progeny.  2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS."

Testosterone propionate dissolved in 20 l olive oil was injected into the yolk before the onset of incubation. Behaviour of newly hatched chicks was recorded in response to both a novel environment in the open-field test and manual restraining in the test of tonic immobility (TI). Behavioural consequences of embryonic exposure to elevated testosterone were observed in the open-field test in all three experiments which indicated inhibition of behavioural responses in hatchlings. Birds treated with testosterone in ovo displayed longer latency to leave the start square, decreased locomotor activity, enhanced defecation and lower number of distress calls as compared to control birds. In TI test, the influence of treatment was manifested at the highest concentration only. Hatchlings from testosterone treated eggs expressed longer duration of TI and required less attempts to induce TI in comparison with the control group. Our results demonstrated increased fearfulness of Japanese quail chicks hatched from eggs with experimentally elevated testosterone content. The effect is specific for a short period after hatching since previous studies reported stimulatory effect of yolk testosterone on behaviour of Japanese quail later in ontogeny."

In this study we examined how short-term, within-pair manipulations of brood size (reduced, original and enlarged) affected provisioning rate in the fairy martin, Hirundo ariel. Following each manipulation, provisioning rates were monitored continuously for a two day period. Total provisioning rate increased when broods were enlarged and decreased when broods were reduced, though increases were inadequate to meet demand in enlarged broods because per chick feeding and growth rates declined. Both sexes responded similarly to brood size change over the course of the two days following the manipulation and there was no overall difference in provisioning share between treatments. Provisioning rate was correlated with wind strength (negatively) and ambient temperature (positively) but the response of the sexes to these variables was also similar. The absence of any change in provisioning share with brood demand suggests that alternative activities that could be traded-off against provisioning (e. g., self-maintenance) were similar for both sexes. Nevertheless, provisioning share may vary with the interval (i.e., hours, days, weeks) between the manipulation and measurement of provisioning, and these dynamics may contribute to explaining the inconsistent findings reported in the many previous studies examining the relationship between brood size and provisioning share.  2007 Brill Academic Publishers."

Memory recall was unaltered when DHEAS was administered at 30 min before training in a control group trained on a strongly aversive stimulus, confirming memory-specific effects.

Here, we show experimentally that elevated levels of prenatal testosterone increase resting metabolic rate in nestling zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata).

Here, we tested whether (1) concentrations of yolk androgens in passerine species were associated with offspring predation and (2) embryo and nestling development rates were associated with yolk androgen concentrations. We examined three androgens that increase in potency along the synthesis pathway: androstenedione (A4) to testosterone (T) to 5- dihydrotestosterone (5-DHT). Concentrations of none of these steroids were related to clutch size; only A4 was allometrically related to egg volume. Species that experience greater predation showed higher yolk concentrations of T and 5-DHT. Higher concentrations of T and particularly 5-DHT were strongly correlated with faster development during the embryo period and less so during the nestling period. Development rates were most strongly correlated with 5-DHT, suggesting that potency increases along the androgen synthesis pathway and that effects are mediated by the androgen receptor pathway. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that selection for faster development by time-dependent offspring mortality may be achieved epigenetically by varying embryo exposure to maternal anabolic steroids.  2007 by The University of Chicago.

Despite considerable recent interest in plasma and yolk testosterone (T) in female birds, relatively little is known about environmental regulation of female T, individual variation in female T or the relationship between plasma and yolk T. 2. In breeding females of a wild population of dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis), we assessed variation in the responsiveness of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis to a challenge with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) by measuring circulating T before and 30 min after a standardized injection of GnRH. We asked whether response to challenge varied seasonally or with stage of reproduction and whether it was repeatable within individuals or related to T deposited in eggs. 3. Initial and post-challenge levels of T were measured using enzyme immunoassay. In a subset of these females, luteinising hormone (LH) was measured using radioimmunoassay (RIA). In addition, eggs were collected from nests of 15 females that had received a GnRH challenge, and yolk T was measured using RIA. 4. During most of the breeding season, plasma T did not increase in response to GnRH. GnRH consistently caused increases in plasma T only during the 7 days before oviposition, when females were rapidly depositing yolk in eggs but had not yet begun to lay them. Among a small subset of females we found a positive correlation between the magnitude of this increase in plasma T in response to GnRH during egg development and the amount of T deposited in the yolk of eggs collected at a later time. 5. These results suggest that ovarian response to GnRH-induced increases in LH is greatest when females are actively depositing yolk into eggs. Factors that stimulate the release of GnRH during egg formation may result in higher levels of plasma T which could influence adult female behaviour.

For example, a correlation between offspring sex and hatching date is produced by temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) in turtles and lizards, and by laying asynchrony and differential incubation behaviours in birds. Our laboratory experiments on montane lizards (Bassiana duperreyi, Scincidae) provide the first direct evidence of an intrinsic sex effect on the date of hatching in a reptile. All eggs within a clutch are laid on the same day but, even when incubated under identical thermal and hydric conditions, male lizards hatch about 2 days earlier than do their sisters. The effects are not due to laying asynchrony, differential incubation by parents, TSD or sex differences in mean egg size. Hormonally induced sex reversal did not eliminate the sex disparity in incubation periods, suggesting that this sex disparity is due to events occurring prior to oviposition rather than to sexual differences following gonadal differentiation. In the field, the intrinsically briefer incubation of male embryos is counterbalanced by two other trends: smaller eggs more often produce males and tend to hatch later than larger eggs within the same clutch; and cooler (and thus, later-hatching) nests overproduce male offspring via thermally induced sex reversal. Thus, somewhat ironically, the sex-specific hatching asynchrony of laboratory-incubated eggs may reflect adaptation to minimize sex differences in dates of hatching.  2007 Ecological Society of Australia."

High investment in offspring number usually results in an increased competition among nest mates. The deterioration of the early developmental conditions, due to this increased competition, can impair individual quality over the long term, and subsequently affect survival and lifetime fecundity. Moreover, the consequences of the allocation rule to offspring number vs. quality can extend across generations and give raise to grandparental effects. These transgenerational trade-offs have been explored rarely. In the present study, we manipulated the breeding effort of captive zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) by offering them enlarged or reduced broods. Offspring reared under these conditions were allowed to breed freely in an outdoor aviary, during their entire lifespan. Second-generation fledglings whose mother was raised in enlarged broods were in lower body condition than offspring whose mother was raised in reduced broods. However, second-generation fledglings were not affected by the brood size experienced by the father. These results show that the solution of parental dilemma, whether producing a small number of high quality offspring or a large number of poor quality descendants, must take into account the long-term transgenerational effects acting on grandchildren.  2007 The Linnean Society of London."

Recent studies have reported sex-specific effects of hormones on offspring viability. Specifically, we previously found that elevating the plasma androgen level in mothers results in a male-biased offspring primary sex ratio, but it affects the viability of sons negatively and daughters positively in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata; Rutkowska and Cicho, Anim Behav, 71:1283-1288, 2006). In this study, we studied further fitness consequences of exposure to elevated yolk androgen levels in zebra finches. We measured growth rate and cellular immune response of nestlings that hatched from eggs laid by females injected with testosterone during egg laying and nestlings of unaffected control females. We found that sons of testosterone-treated females grew slower in comparison to sons of control females. The significant interaction between experimental group and offspring sex indicates that sons of testosterone-treated mothers suffered impaired immune responsiveness while daughters seemed to benefit from elevated androgen level in terms of enhanced immune responsiveness. We found no effects of androgens on offspring performance at adulthood-neither fecundity of females nor attractiveness of males was affected. We conclude that the benefits of biasing sex ratio towards males by increasing androgen level in the yolk may be limited due to negative effects on male offspring performance early in life.  2007 Springer-Verlag."

Yolk androgens in birds are a relatively well-known maternal effect and have been linked to adaptations related to development, coloniality life, and sexual selection. We tested whether interspecific patterns of yolk androgen levels (androstenedione and testosterone) were related to interspecific variation in development, sexual selection, and coloniality. First, we found no relationship between androgen levels and duration of development as reflected by incubation and nestling periods. However, androstenedione concentration was positively related to the relative duration of the incubation period and negatively related to the relative duration of the nestling period. These relationships were confirmed by analyses of phylogenetically independent contrasts. We suggest that androstenedione concentration may have evolved as a mechanism to shift the relative duration of development between the egg and nestling stages in response to selective pressures that differentially affect the duration of each stage. Second, neither plumage dichromatism nor mating system explained significant variation in yolk androgen levels after correction for similarity among species due to common descent. This finding indicates that sexual selection has not been an important selective pressure for this maternal effect. Third, we found a highly significant positive relationship between degree of breeding coloniality and concentration of androstenedione but not testosterone. These effects were confirmed in analyses of contrasts controlling for similarity due to common descent. Since the relationship with coloniality was different for each androgen, it is unlikely that increased levels of androgens in highly colonial species are a mere consequence of elevated androgen levels in mothers. Rather, our results suggest that high levels of androstenedione in eggs of colonial species are an adaptation to colony life, possibly related to the production of highly competitive phenotypes. In conclusion, from a comparative perspective, the results of this study support the role of maternal effects in promoting adaptation to certain environmental pressures.  2007 by The University of Chicago."

If Homeobox or other genes had pleiotropic effects on development of digits, behavior, and physiology of males and females, we would expect secondary sexual characters and immunity to be related to digit ratio in a sex-specific manner. The size of the visible part of the black badge in February (a secondary sexual character), but not total badge size, was positively correlated with digit ratios, suggesting that males with more male-like digit ratios had larger visible badges. Because of sex-specific effects of development on secondary sexual characters and immunity, we predicted sex-specific differences in immune response to be related to digit ratio. House sparrows with large digit ratios had weaker T cell-mediated immune response than individuals with small digit ratios, particularly in females, implying that females with more male-like digit ratios had weak immune responses.

We investigated proximate determinants of SSD in several species of squamate reptiles, including three species of Sceloporus lizards and the diamond-backed rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox). In natural populations of these species, SSD is caused by sexual differences in age-specific growth. Males and females, however, may often share similar potentials for growth: growth is strongly responsive to the availability of food, and sexual differences in growth can be greatly suppressed or completely absent under common environmental conditions in the laboratory. Sexually divergent growth is expressed in natural environments because of inherent ecological differences between males and females and because of potential epigenetic effects of sex-specific growth regulators. In field-active Sceloporus, sexual differences in growth rate are associated with sexual divergence in plasma testosterone. Experiments confirm that testosterone inhibits growth in species in which females are larger (for example, S. undulatus and S. virgatus) and stimulates growth in those in which males are larger (for example, S. jarrovii). Interestingly, however, sexual divergence in plasma testosterone is not accompanied by divergence in growth in S. jarrovii or in male-larger C. atrox in the laboratory. Furthermore, experimental effects of castration and testosterone replacement on growth are not evident in captive S. jarrovii, possibly because growth effects of testosterone are superseded by an abundant, high-quality diet. In female-larger S. undulatus, growth may be traded-off against testosterone-induced reproductive costs of activity. In male-larger species, costs of reproduction in terms of growth are suggested by supplemental feeding of reproductive female C. atrox in their natural environment and by experimental manipulation of reproductive cost in female S. jarrovii. Growth costs of reproduction, however, do not contribute substantially to the development of SSD in male-larger S. jarrovii. We conclude that the energetic costs of testosterone-induced, male reproductive behavior may contribute substantially to the development of SSD in some female-larger species. However, despite strong evidence that reproductive investment exacts a substantial cost in growth, we do not support the reproductive cost hypothesis as a general explanation of SSD in male-larger species."

As expected, the 2D:4D was lower in men as compared to women for both hands. Moreover, in contrast to questionnaire data, men reveal higher levels of aggression in the computer task compared to women.

High parental baseline corticosterone concentrations correlated with lower fledgling weights at both sites.

In an experiment where pre-breeding diet was manipulated, we investigated if allocation of yolk androgens (testosterone and 5-dihydrotestosterone) was related to the quality of diet experienced prior to breeding. Female zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata produced larger clutches on high quality diet than on low quality diet but with no differences in egg mass. Yolk androgen levels were repeatable within subsequent clutches of the same female and females did not change mean androgen content in eggs in relation to diet quality. However, within-in clutch pattern of yolk testosterone and DHT changed with diet treatment.

However, two nonexclusive evolutionary hypotheses predict an interspecific relationship between egg testosterone levels and the elaboration of sexual traits. First, maternal investment may be particularly enhanced in sexually selected species, which should generate a positive relationship. Secondly, high prenatal testosterone levels may constrain the development of sexual characters, which should result in a negative relationship. Here we investigated these hypotheses by exploring the relationship between yolk testosterone levels and features of song in a phylogenetic study of 36 passerine species. We found that song duration and syllable repertoire size were significantly negatively related to testosterone levels in the egg, even if potentially confounding factors were held constant. These relationships imply that high testosterone levels during early development of songs may be detrimental, thus supporting the developmental constraints hypothesis. By contrast, we found significant evidence that song-post exposure relative to the height of the vegetation is positively related to egg testosterone levels. These results support the hypothesis that high levels of maternal testosterone have evolved in species with intense sexual selection acting on the location of song-posts. We found nonsignificant effects for intersong interval and song type repertoire size, which may suggest that none of the above hypothesis apply to these traits, or they act simultaneously and have opposing effects.  2007 The Authors."

To investigate possible sex differences in tactics in zebra finches, we manipulated the condition of one cohort of females by trimming their flight feathers; a second cohort of females and all males were left intact. Focal observations of feeding behavior revealed that manipulated females did not reduce their feeding time, but rather focused their efforts on rearing sons, while control females allocated effort to rearing daughters. Males mated to manipulated females tended to focus effort to daughters, while control males showed no consistent response. Manipulated females experienced a lower reproductive rate, primarily because of a low daughter rate, relative to control females. Manipulated females also laid smaller clutches and had longer inter-clutch intervals, which suggest that their ability to metabolize and allocate essential proteins from pectoral muscle mass during the egg-laying period was impaired. To our knowledge, this study is the first to show that parents of both sexes make active sex allocation decisions when the physiological condition of one parent is manipulated; males do not simply adopt female allocation patterns, but make complementary adjustments.

Such constraints are supported by the interspecific relationship between ontological differences and relative brain size in birds and mammals. Given that mothers can strongly influence the development of the offspring via maternal effects that potentially involve substances essential for growing brains, we argue that such effects may represent an important but overlooked component of developmental constraints on brain size. To demonstrate the importance of maternal effect on the evolution of brains, we investigated the interspecific relationship between relative brain size and maternal effects, as reflected by yolk testosterone, carotenoids, and vitamins A and E in a phylogenetic study of birds. Females of species with relatively large brains invested more in eggs in terms of testosterone and vitamin E than females of species with small brains. The effects of carotenoid and vitamin A levels on the evolution of relative brain size were weaker and non-significant. The association between relative brain size and yolk testosterone was curvilinear, suggesting that very high testosterone levels can be suppressive. However, at least in moderate physiological ranges, the positive relationship between components of maternal effects and relative brain size may imply one aspect of developmental costs of large brains. The relationship between vitamin E and relative brain size was weakened when we controlled for developmental mode, and thus the effect of this antioxidant may be indirect. Testosterone-enhanced neurogenesis and vitamin E-mediated defence against oxidative stress may have key functions when the brain of the embryo develops, with evolutionary consequences for relative brain size.  2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the effects of the variation of different components of cleidoic eggs have been little investigated. 2. Here, we addressed whether a reduction of the relative egg albumen content within the natural range of variation affects viability, time to hatching, early post-natal begging displays, morphology and immune response of yellow-legged gull Larus michahellis chicks. 3. Egg mass strongly positively predicted chick size and mass at all ages, while time to hatching positively predicted tarsus length and immune response, irrespective of albumen removal. Variation in time to hatching may thus affect immune system maturation. 4. Albumen removal resulted in a lower embryonic viability and increased time to hatching of individual eggs. The probability that an egg originated a chick surviving until 8 days of age increased with original egg mass among controls, but not among chicks hatching from eggs with reduced albumen content (""albumen chicks""). 5. Begging rate increased with laying order among albumen chicks while it decreased among controls. Concomitantly, begging rate decreased with egg mass among controls while it did not vary among albumen chicks. Surprisingly, albumen removal did not affect body mass or tarsus length except at 8 days of age, when control chicks were lighter than albumen chicks. 6.

To test this idea, we induced pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) females to nest twice during the same season by removing their first clutches shortly after clutch completion. We collected eggs of first and replacement clutches to measure yolk concentrations of androstenedione (A4) and testosterone (T) and captured the females that laid these clutches for phenotypic measurements. Although average egg androgen levels were remarkably consistent within females, hormone patterns differed considerably between first and replacement clutches. Eggs of replacement clutches were heavier with larger yolks compared to first clutches, but they contained on average lower levels of androgens. Within clutches, androgen concentration increased over the laying sequence in the first clutch, but decreased or remained more constant over the laying sequence in the replacement clutch. Mean yolk T, but not A4 levels, were negatively associated with laying date for both breeding attempts. Moreover, females in good body condition produced eggs containing lower levels of androgens than females in poor condition. Our results are consistent with the idea that differences in yolk androgen levels may be one mechanism underlying seasonal variation in reproductive success and it is possible that changes in egg androgen patterns may reflect a change in female reproductive strategy. High within-female consistency also highlights the possibility that there may be some underlying genetic variation in yolk androgen levels.  2006 Springer-Verlag."

Egg yolks contain carotenoids that protect biological molecules against free-radical damage and promote maturation of the immune system. Availability of carotenoids to birds is often limited. Trade-offs can thus arise in the allocation of carotenoids to different physiological functions, and mothers may influence the immunocompetence of nestlings by modulating the transfer of carotenoid to the yolk. 2. In the great tit Parus major, we experimentally manipulated the dietary supply of carotenoid to mothers, and partially cross-fostered hatchlings to investigate the effect of an increased availability of carotenoids during egg laying on immunocompetence of nestlings. 3. In addition, we infested half of the nests with hen fleas Ceratophyllus gallinae to investigate the relationship between carotenoid availability, resistance to ectoparasites and immunocompetence. 4. We found that the procedure of cross-fostering can reduce the immune response of nestlings, but this effect can be compensated by the maternally transferred carotenoids. Cross-fostered nestlings of carotenoid-supplemented females show a similar immune response to non-cross-fostered nestlings, while cross-fostered nestlings of control females mounted a weaker cell-mediated immune response. This suggests that yolk carotenoids may help nestlings to cope with stress, for example the one generated by cross-fostering and/or they may enhance nestling competitiveness. 5. There was no statistically significant interaction between parasite and carotenoid treatments, as would be expected if carotenoids helped nestlings to fight parasites. Under parasite pressure, however, lighter nestlings raised a lower immune response, while the immune response was only weakly correlated with body mass in uninfested nests.  2007 The Authors."

We manipulated dietary quality of reproducing female lizards (Amphibolurus muricatus; Agamidae), a species with temperature-dependent sex determination, to examine strategies of reproductive allocation. Females maintained on a poor-quality diet produced fewer clutches but massively (twofold) larger eggs with lower concentrations of yolk testosterone than did conspecific females given a high-quality diet. Although all eggs were incubated at the same temperature, and yolk steroid hormone levels were not correlated with offspring sex, the nutrient-deprived females produced highly male-biased sex ratios among their offspring. These responses to maternal nutrition generate a link between sex and offspring size, in a direction likely to enhance maternal fitness if large body size enhances reproductive success more in sons than in daughters (as seems plausible, given the mating system of this species). Overall, our results show that sex determination in these animals is more complex, and responsive to a wider range of environmental cues, than that suggested by the classification of 'environmental sex determination'.  2007 The Royal Society."

We measured yolk hormones (dihydrotestosterone, testosterone, and 17 -estradiol) in newly laid eggs of the montane scincid lizard Bassiana duperreyi. This species is well suited to such an analysis because (1) offspring sex is influenced by incubation temperatures and egg size as well as by sex chromosomes, suggesting that yolk hormones might somehow be involved in the complex pathways of sex determination, and (2) experimental application of either estradiol or fadrozole to such eggs strongly influences offspring sex. We obtained yolk by biopsy, before incubating the eggs at a temperature that produces a 50:50 sex ratio. Yolk steroid levels varied over a threefold range between eggs from different clutches, but there were no significant differences in yolk steroids, or in relative composition of steroids, between eggs destined to become male versus female.

In the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara), earlier studies have shown that maternal plasma corticosterone level interacts with maternal phenotype to affect offspring phenotype and dispersal strategy, and may reflect the mother's external and/or internal environment. However, the mechanism by which these two types of environmental information are integrated has not been identified. We explored the possibility that the timing and duration of the corticosterone signal are the key factors by which the message is modulated. We found that the timing of corticosterone exposure affects the juvenile phenotype: an exposure to corticosterone early in development has negative effects on juvenile size, weight, and body condition, that can nevertheless be restored in the case of a prolonged exposure. The duration of corticosterone exposure affects the dispersal strategy, although the precise effect depends on the sex ratio of the clutch. That is, in female-biased clutches, a prolonged exposure during gestation promotes philopatry of juveniles, while a short exposure enhances their dispersal, a result that is consistent with kin competition theory. Therefore, our results demonstrate that while corticosterone titer may signal a mother's external and/or internal environment to her developing young, differences in the timing and duration of this endocrine signal produce offspring with specialized phenotypes that exhibit different dispersal strategies.  2006 Elsevier Inc.

The anaphase-promoting complex (APC) and a conserved APC adaptor, Cdc20 (also known as Fzy), are required for anaphase progression in mitotic cells. The APC has also been implicated in meiosis, although it is not yet understood how it mediates these non-canonical divisions. Cortex (Cort) is a diverged Fzy homologue that is expressed in the female germline of Drosophila, where it functions with the Cdk1-interacting protein Cks30A to drive anaphase in meiosis II. Here, we show that Cort functions together with the canonical mitotic APC adaptor Fzy to target the three mitotic cyclins (A, B and B3) for destruction in the egg and drive anaphase progression in both meiotic divisions. In addition to controlling cyclin destruction globally in the egg, Cort and Fzy appear to both be required for the local destruction of cyclin B on spindles. We find that cyclin B associates with spindle microtubules throughout meiosis I and meiosis II, and dissociates from the meiotic spindle in anaphase II. Fzy and Cort are required for this loss of cyclin B from the meiotic spindle. Our results lead to a model in which the germline-specific APCCort cooperates with the more general APCFzy, both locally on the meiotic spindle and globally in the egg cytoplasm, to target cyclins for destruction and drive progression through the two meiotic divisions."

Some of those suggest that the resulting hatching asynchrony (HA) is adaptive because it increases the size hierarchy among offspring and in turn reduces nestling competition and energy demands during the peak feeding period. Others argue that IBCC is a good strategy in unpredictable environments. When food conditions deteriorate, the large size hierarchy quickly results in the death of the last hatched nestlings, allowing the remaining ones to survive and fledge in better condition. In comparison, under favorable conditions, all nestlings can fledge independent of hatching order. To test these hypotheses, we performed a brood size manipulation experiment (as a simulation of good and bad years) in collared flycatchers Ficedula albicollis and examined the effect of size hierarchy on offspring and brood performance. We found that chicks with an initial size disadvantage experienced reduced body mass growth and had shorter feathers at fledging in both reduced and enlarged broods. In enlarged broods, they also fledged with a smaller skeletal size. Although broods on average or parents could possibly still benefit from HA when food is scarce, this was not seen in the current study. Parental survival was not related to the size hierarchy in the broods, and the average body mass growth of the nestlings was slower in broods with a high initial size variance. We therefore conclude that HA and the resulting size hierarchy are probably detrimental for the growth of nestlings in both good and bad years, at least in species where nestling mortality does not occur early in life.

Bird song is immensely involved in sexual selection, thus not-surprisingly, it usually shows age-dependent variation. Although the collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis has been intensively studied for its sexual traits, and female preference for male age is expected to be strong, there is no quantitative information on age-dependent expression of song in this species. Here, we fill this gap and, based on phenotypic correlations, we report the relationship between age and several song features. Repertoire size was consistently smaller in yearlings than in older males, but it also tended to increase after the second year of breeding. In a meta-analysis of effect sizes using data from the literature, we found that the strength of the relationship between age and repertoire size in the collared flycatcher is similar to patterns observed in other passerines. Song rate was inversely related to age, as yearlings sang at higher rates than older males. Generally, effect sizes for the relationship between age and other song traits were of medium level on average, and had broad confidence intervals. Song traits covaried with survival in a direction suggesting that differences in song between age categories are unlikely to result from phenotype dependent survival. Our results generally support the hypothesis that song holds the potential to function as a reliable indicator of male age in the collared flycatcher. However, it seems that not all song traits are unambiguously more expressed in older males than in yearlings.  2007 The Authors Journal compilation 2007 Blackwell Verlag."

There is currently great interest among behavioural ecologists in maternally allocated yolk androgens, especially their relationship with offspring sex and development. Such studies need embryonic tissue for sexing, however, requiring eggs to be incubated (usually for 3 days). Therefore, there are concerns about whether the androgen concentrations assayed reflect those allocated by the mother. In addition, studies showing sex biases in maternal allocation of androgens could be confounded if male and female embryos uptake or metabolise androgens at different rates. We ran a series of experiments using zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) eggs to address these potential confounding factors. First we showed, using eggs naturally incubated for up to 5 days, that eggs containing embryos had lower yolk androgen concentrations than eggs that had failed to form embryos. We then tested various hypotheses for this difference using controlled incubation treatments. Our results suggested that (a) embryo development causes the yolk to become progressively more diluted with albumin; and (b) between 3 and 5days of incubation embryos start uptaking or metabolising androgens. Crucially, we found no decline in yolk androgen concentration at 3 days incubation, and no evidence for sex-specific rates of uptake or metabolism of androgens. This strongly suggests that yolk androgen levels up to 3 days incubation do reflect those allocated by the mother, and that studies of sex biased maternal allocation of yolk androgens are not confounded by sex differences in embryo development.  2006 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we tested whether artificial selection for divergent social behaviour in Japanese quail had resulted in correlated changes in yolk androgen levels. We used lines that had been selected at the chick stage for high and low motivation to regain contact with a group of conspecific chicks. This procedure has led to important behavioural differences in the high and low line in a suite of behavioural correlates of sociality. We found that eggs laid by the line selected for high motivation for social reinstatement contained more than twice the amount of yolk testosterone of eggs laid by females from the low line, while the unselected line laid eggs with intermediate levels.

Carotenoids play crucial roles in antioxidant protection and immune defence mechanisms, but they may be available to females in limiting amounts. Therefore, their allocation to the eggs may be influenced by the female's condition, age and environmental circumstances. Furthermore, the quality of the male parent, which affects the reproductive value of the offspring, may also influence this investment. In this correlational study, we investigated proximate and ultimate factors that may lead to variation in yolk lutein, zeaxanthin and -carotene concentrations among and within clutches of a wild passerine, the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis). We found that carotenoid concentration was positively associated with caterpillar supply at the time of egg formation, which suggests a proximate constraint of carotenoid availability on yolk composition. Neither female condition, body size, age, nor male plumage ornamentation, age and body size correlated with carotenoid deposition. Yolk -carotene concentration was found to be positively linked to yolk testosterone concentration. We suggest that females allocated more -carotene to their eggs to mitigate the potentially detrimental effects of elevated steroid concentration. We found that concentration of -carotene increased with laying order. The possible function of this pattern may be to enhance the resistance to oxidative stress and pathogens of the disadvantaged last-hatching nestling, suggesting that collared flycatchers pursue a compensatory, ""brood survival"" strategy.  2006 Springer-Verlag."

The thrifty phenotype hypothesis proposed that early-life metabolic adaptations promote survival, with the developing organism responding to cues of environmental quality by selecting an appropriate trajectory of growth. Recently, some authors have proposed that the thrifty phenotype is also adaptive in the longer-term, by preparing the organism for its likely adult environment. However, windows of plasticity close early during human development, and subsequent environmental changes may result in the selected trajectory becoming inappropriate, leading to adverse effects on health. This paradox generates uncertainty as to whether the thrifty phenotype is indeed adaptive for the offspring in humans. The thrifty phenotype should not be considered a dichotomous concept, rather it refers to the capacity of all offspring to respond to environmental information during early ontogenetic development. This article argues that the thrifty phenotype is the consequence of three different adaptive processes - niche construction, maternal effects, and developmental plasticity - all of which in humans are influenced by our large brains. While developmental plasticity represents an adaptation by the offspring, both niche construction and parental effects are subject to selection on parental rather than offspring fitness. The three processes also operate at different paces. Human offspring do not become net calories-producers until around 18 years of age, such that the high energy costs of the human brain are paid primarily by the mother, even after weaning. The evolutionary expansion of human brain volume occurred in environments characterised by high volatility, inducing strong selective pressure on maternal capacity to provision multiple offspring simultaneously. The thrifty phenotype is therefore best considered as a manipulation of offspring phenotype for the benefit of maternal fitness. The information that enters offspring phenotype during early development does not predict the likely future environment of the offspring, but rather reflects the mother's own developmental experience and the quality of the environment during her own maturation. Offspring growth trajectory thus becomes aligned with long-term maternal capacity to provision. In contemporary populations, the sensitivity of offspring development to maternal phenotype exposes the offspring to adverse effects, through four distinct pathways. The offspring may be exposed to (1) poor maternal metabolic control (e.g. gestational diabetes), (2) maternally derived toxins (e.g. maternal smoking), or (3) low maternal social status (e.g. small size). Adverse consequences of these effects may then be exacerbated by (4) exposure either to the ""toxic"" western environment in postnatal life, in which diet and physical activity levels are mismatched with metabolic experience in utero, or at the other extreme to famine. The rapid emergence of the epidemic of the metabolic syndrome in the 20th Century reflects the rapid acceleration in the pace of niche construction relative to the slower physiological combination of developmental plasticity and parental effects.  2007 Cambridge Philosophical Society."

Nestling zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) were exposed twice daily to exogenous CORT via oral administration for a 12-day period up until fledging. Experimental CORT administration depressed nestling growth rates, confirming results previously obtained in this species. Our data on neophobic behavior revealed a significant interaction between sex and treatment, with CORT-dosed males showing reduced latencies to approach a novel object, while there was little effect of corticosterone treatment on female neophobia. There was no significant effect of age (30 or 50days), however, there was a non-significant trend towards an interaction between treatment and age, with neophobia increasing with age in the CORT-dosed birds, but decreasing in controls. At 50days of age previous exposure to corticosterone resulted in reduced success in competitions for a non-food-based resource (a perch) in both sexes. There were no effects of brood size on any behavioral traits measured here, but this may be due to the small range in brood size used. Our results show that elevated levels of stress hormones during postnatal development can have significant effects on important behavioral traits, i.e., neophobia and dominance. Moreover, they confirm the importance of rearing conditions in shaping adult phenotypes.  2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Since then, knowledge of both the factors that influence maternal deposition patterns and their consequences for offspring development has accumulated rapidly. To date, the field has been dominated by the idea that mothers use yolk hormones to adaptively adjust offspring development, a view that assigns control over hormone deposition and its effects on the offspring to the mother. This neglects the possibility that the evolutionary interests of the mother and offspring differ. When there is such parent-offspring conflict, the offspring are selected to respond to the hormones in a way that is adaptive for themselves rather than for the mother. Moreover, sexual conflict between the parents over parental investment may shape the evolution of yolk hormone deposition: females may manipulate the male's contribution to parental care through the effect of yolk hormones on offspring begging, competitiveness, and developmental rate. We therefore suggest that for a full understanding of the evolution of hormone-mediated maternal effects, it is essential to study both fitness consequences and physiological mechanisms and constraints from the perspective of all family members."

Until recently, the observations were dominated by the idea that yolk steroids of maternal origin play an important role in sex determination of oviparous vertebrates. However, more recent studies have cast significant doubt on the above conclusion. These studies suggest instead that steroids may be present in the yolk simply as the byproduct of passive uptake during yolk formation or observed correlations might reflect embryonically produced rather than maternally derived steroids. Thus, the objective of the present review is (i) to provide an overview of such paradoxical observations on the role of maternal yolk steroids in sex determination of reptiles, (ii) to identify and provide brief explanations for the observed paradoxical results, and (iii) to provide some future research directions.

Juveniles of birds under strong nest predation pressure grow rapidly, have short incubation and nestling periods, and leave the nest at low body mass. Life-history theory predicts that parental investment increases with adult mortality rate. Thus, developmental traits that depend on the parental effort exerted (pre- and postnatal growth rate) should scale positively with adult mortality, in contrast to those that do not have a direct relationship with parental investment (timing of developmental events, e.g. nest leaving). I tested this prediction on a sample of 84 North American songbirds. Nestling growth rate scaled positively and incubation period duration negatively with annual adult mortality rates even when controlled for nest predation and other covariates, including phylogeny. On the contrary, neither the duration of the nestling period nor body mass at fledging showed any relationship. Proximate mechanisms generating the relationship of pre- and postnatal growth rates to adult mortality may include increased feeding, nest attentiveness during incubation and/or allocation of hormones, and deserve further attention.  2007 The Authors."

In most studies of avian yolk carotenoids, eggs are destructively sampled and this may limit both the number of clutches studied and the research questions addressed. We describe an empirical field trial for a nondestructive biopsy method to extract small samples (0.05 ml) of egg yolk for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of yolk carotenoid concentrations. We sampled 180 clutches (N = 44 biopsies) of two species of introduced thrushes (genus Turdus) from agricultural habitats in central North Island, New Zealand. Once the protocol was established, all biopsied eggs from clutches that were not depredated or deserted before candling were found to be developing normally after 3-5 d of incubation (N = 28) and all hatched. Biopsy samples (>0.02 g) produced concentrations of yolk carotenoids (and variances) that were statistically indistinguishable from whole yolk destructive samples. In addition, our samples (>0.02 g) confirmed previously reported differences in yolk carotenoid concentrations between the two thrush species and revealed a significant decline in yolk carotenoid concentration with laying order. Further examination of how variability in yolk carotenoid concentration and identity influences offspring sex, success, and survival or, later in life, reproductive success and ability to efficiently incorporate dietary carotenoids into both integument and immune tissues will require larger sample sizes. Studies to date have been restricted by the number of destructive samples that investigators are willing (or permitted) to obtain from wild species. Thus, we hope that our nondestructive method of sampling yolk will promote further examination of the links between carotenoid uptake from the environment and maternal investment in the avian yolk. 2007 Association of Field Ornithologists."

Since yolk carotenoids may enhance offspring fitness, but may be available to females in limiting amounts, the correlation we found suggests adaptive egg quality adjustment in response to mate attractiveness, but an experimental approach is required to rule out alternative explanations. Yolk colour was also correlated with laying date and yolk mass. Though the effect of laying date could not be explained by ambient temperature during egg formation, it suggests a proximate constraint of general carotenoid availability on yolk composition.

The Blue-footed Booby (Sula nebouxii) is a long-lived seabird with facultative siblicide. We examined whether there is differential resource allocation to eggs with laying order and whether greater egg mass increases hatching probability, chick survival, hatching interval, and mass and size at hatching. We found that the relative investment in first and second eggs decreased as the season advanced: second eggs were slightly (1.5%) heavier than first eggs in early clutches; by contrast, first eggs were 2% heavier than second eggs in late clutches. Accordingly, hatching probability increased with laying date for first eggs and decreased for second eggs. The mass of the egg increased hatching probability, and no effect on chick survival was detected. Laying interval increased after a heavier egg was laid, and heavier eggs produced heavier hatchlings. Hatching intervals were positively related to laying intervals, but egg mass was unrelated to the length of the incubation period and the hatching interval. Our results suggest that egg mass influences embryo survival and that Blue-footed Booby females may adaptively allocate resources to eggs of different laying order according to breeding conditions.

Here we show that different dispersal strategies maximize the reproductive success of young great tits (Parus major) originating from a parasite-infested or a parasite-free nest and demonstrate that differential transfer of maternal yolk androgens in response to parasitism can result in a modification of the offspring's dispersal behavior that appears adaptive.

While many components of avian reproduction appear to vary with parental age, the effect of age on incubation has largely been ignored so far. In this study, we tested whether young herring gulls provide a different incubation environment from mature ones and whether this has consequences for offspring performance. Laying and rearing conditions were standardised using a cross-fostering protocol. Egg predation rates tended to be higher in the nests of young parents. However, nest site, nest construction and egg temperature during incubation did not vary with parental age. Overall, the duration of incubation was shorter in young compared to mature birds and this reflected the later laying date of the former, since incubation duration generally decreased across the season. However, male eggs incubated by young parents had longer incubation periods than predicted for their laying dates. In contrast, incubation length of female eggs incubated by young pairs, and of male and female eggs incubated by mature birds did not deviate from the expected for any given laying date. Offspring that had been incubated by young parents had considerably poorer survival than those incubated by mature pairs, despite being reared under standardized, favourable conditions (singly, by mature parents). This was due to increased mortality among female chicks that had been incubated by young parents. The chicks incubated as eggs by young and mature birds, which survived until fledging, did not differ in body mass and size growth, or body condition. The results of this study demonstrate that parental age can influence offspring performance via variation in incubation environment, and that females are more susceptible than males to conditions experienced during embryonic development.

We measured and experimentally increased circulating testosterone levels in nestling Eurasian kestrels Falco tinnunculus. We investigated, possible sexual differences in testosterone levels and the effect of this hormone on growth (body mass and tarsus length) and cell-mediated immunity in males and females. We also explored testosterone effects on rump coloration, a highly variable melanin-based trait in male nestlings. We analysed data on circulating testosterone levels of nestlings in 15 additional bird species. 3. Increased levels of testosterone tended to negatively affect body condition, reduced cell-mediated immune responses in male and female nestlings and also diminished the expression of grey rump coloration in male nestlings. No sex differences were observed in testosterone levels in either control or increased testosterone group nestlings, and no interactions were found between sex and treatment. However, male nestlings showed a lower cell-mediated immune response than females in both groups. 4. Our results indicate first, that a high level of testosterone in all nestlings in a brood entails costs, at least in terms of immunity, coloration and probably growth. Secondly, sex differences in post-natal cell-mediated immunity, and consequently in the capacity to prevent diseases, cannot be explained by sex differences in circulating testosterone levels. Finally, by comparing published data at an interspecific level, contradictory sex patterns in circulating testosterone levels have been found, supporting the idea that circulating testosterone might not be a proximate factor causing sex-dependent vulnerability in bird species.  2006 The Authors."

We tested the hypothesis that an adjustment in eggshell porosity is one such proximate mechanism (i.e., that avian species with higher ratios of incubation period to egg size lay eggs with less porous shells). Eggshell porosity affects the rate of gaseous exchange between the developing embryo and the external environment; thus, to the extent that embryonic metabolism is diffusion-limited, eggshell porosity could directly determine incubation period. To test that hypothesis, we collected eggs from seven species of Alcidae, a family of marine birds that exhibits an unusual degree of interspecific variation in incubation period, and measured egg mass and eggshell porosity (determined by the number and size of pores and the thickness of the shell). Incubation periods were obtained from the literature. Egg mass and eggshell porosity combined explained 87% of the variation in incubation period among the seven species, which included at least one member of each of the six main alcid lineages. As predicted, eggshell porosity and incubation period were negatively related, after controlling for egg mass. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that evolutionary changes in avian incubation period may be attributed, at least in part, to adjustments in eggshell porosity.

Natural selection may favour elevated competitiveness of parasite young, since the negative consequences of increased sibling competition are incurred on the unrelated host parents and siblings, and therefore do not act as inclusive fitness costs for the parasites. Parasitizing females could achieve such a competitive advantage for their offspring by laying larger eggs or eggs with higher concentrations of testosterone in the yolk. We analyzed these parameters of the six parasitized nests, but did not find that parasite eggs differ systematically in these aspects from host eggs, nor that parasite eggs showed resemblance to host eggs. We suggest that a shortage of available nest sites caused some females to use CBP as a best-of-a bad job strategy, but that either the occurrence of CBP is too rare to lead to strong selection for egg adjustments or that parasitizing females are unable to do so.

Current models of sexual selection predict that signals such as song must be costly to develop or maintain to constitute honest indicators of male quality. It has been proposed that reductions of nestling condition during song development might limit the expression of song learning. Adult song could thus act as an indicator of early stress as only males that enjoy good condition during development could learn accurately and sing long songs or large repertoires. We tested this hypothesis in the zebra finch by modifying early condition through cross-fostering chicks to small, medium, and large broods. Song learning was very accurate and was found to reflect very closely tutor song characteristics and to depend on the number of males in the tutoring group. Although the brood size manipulation strongly affected several measures of nestling condition and adult biometry, we found no relationship between early condition and song learning scores or song characteristics. Similarly, brain mass and high vocal center (HVC), robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), and lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (LMAN) volumes did not covary with nestling condition and growth measurements. We found no significant relationship between song repertoire size and HVC and RA volumes, although there was a nonsignificant trend for HVC to increase with increasing proportion of learnt elements in a song.

Supplementary feeding experiments show that timing of egg formation and the number and quality of eggs formed can depend on energetic and nutritional factors, although they may not all be affected in the same way. Resources required for egg formation may come both from body reserves accumulated before egg formation starts and resource intake during egg formation. Egg formation is not only costly in terms of resource requirement, but variation in egg formation effort also has consequences on the bird's fitness. Increased egg formation effort can lead to poorer body condition at the end of laying, poorer egg quality, reduced parental chick rearing ability and lower future reproductive success."

The sequence of the Strongylocentrotus purpuratus genome offers unique opportunities to apply functional genomic and proteomic approaches to investigate the repertoire and regulation of Ca2+ signaling and homeostasis modules present in the egg and zygote. The sea urchin ""calcium toolkit"" as predicted by the genome is described. Emphasis is on the Ca2+ signaling modules operating during egg activation, but the Ca2+ signaling repertoire has ramifications for later developmental events and adult physiology as well. Presented here are the mechanisms that control the initial release of Ca2+ at fertilization and additional signaling components predicted by the genome and found to be expressed and operating in eggs at fertilization. The initial release of Ca2+ serves to coordinate egg activation, which is largely a phenomenon of post-translational modifications, especially dynamic protein phosphorylation. Functional proteomics can now be used to identify the phosphoproteome in general and specific kinase targets in particular. This approach is described along with findings to date.

Oocytes acquire full ability to activate just prior to ovulation. Gonadotropin-stimulated antral follicles have preovulatory oocytes that are fully grown, but unable to undergo normal activation if retrieved and injected with inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) or fertilized in vitro. Although the most obvious sign of immaturity is their stage of meiotic maturation, the stage of the oocyte chromatin does not actually explain the failure of normal activation. Important changes in the mammalian oocyte cytoplasm take place during luteinizing hormone (LH)-induced meiotic maturation and are likely to be responsible for the development of activation competence. Like uncapacitated sperm, pre-ovulatory oocytes do not undergo normal signaling and secretion. In addition, fertilized pre-ovulatory oocytes are not able to induce normal decondensation of the sperm chromatin, convert it into a functional state, and undergo pronuclear envelop formation. Translationally mediated increases in expression of proteins such as IP3 receptor (IP3R), glutathione, and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), as well as several crucial cell cycle kinases are considered to be important for normal egg activation and onset of development.  2006 Elsevier Inc.

Their effects on behavioural or physiological traits are well documented in birds, but until now are largely unknown in reptiles. The investigations of yolk steroids in reptiles have been focused mainly on species with temperature-dependent sex determination, where steroid levels are suggested to determine the sex of progeny. Here we report initial oestradiol (E2) and testosterone (T) levels in the yolk of the Madagascar ground gecko, Paroedura picta (Peters, 1854), a species with genetic sex determination. The yolk concentration was 0.39  0.02 ng/g (mean  SE) in E2, whereas the concentration of T was much higher (1.48  0.06 ng/g, mean  SE). Geckos usually lay two exceptionally large eggs per clutch; vitellogenesis and ovulation of both eggs proceed in phase. Individual two-egg clutches differed considerably in E2 and T levels. A clutch mean of E2 levels varied from 0.22 to 0.53 ng/g, whereas T levels varied from a clutch mean of 1.02 to 1.99 ng/g. Both eggs in a clutch possessed very similar levels of E2 and T. Initial yolk steroid levels thus presumably reflect maternal conditions during egg formation rather than differential allocation of hormones according to offspring sex.  2006 NRC."

Lipid-soluble vitamins and carotenoids are potent antioxidants. Female birds deposit these antioxidants into eggs in variable amounts according to environmental and social conditions, and the quantities deposited into eggs can have effects on offspring health and immunological condition. Allocation theory posits that females will alter the distribution of resources according to mate quality, sometimes allocating resources according to the differential allocation hypothesis (DAH), investing more in offspring sired by better-quality males, and other times allocating resources according to a compensatory strategy, enhancing the quality of offspring sired by lower-quality males. It is unknown, however, whether antioxidants are deposited into eggs according to the DAH or a compensatory strategy. We examined deposition patterns of yolk antioxidants (including vitamin E and three carotenoids) in relation to laying order, mate attractiveness, female condition, and yolk androgen content in the house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus). Female house finches deposited significantly more total antioxidants into eggs sired by less attractive males. Additionally, yolk antioxidant content was significantly positively correlated with female condition, which suggests a cost associated with the deposition of antioxidants into eggs. Finally, concentrations of antioxidants in egg yolks were positively correlated with total yolk androgen content. We suggest that yolk antioxidants are deposited according to a compensatory deposition strategy, enabling females to improve the quality of young produced with less attractive males. Additionally, yolk antioxidants may act to counter some of the detrimental effects associated with high levels of yolk androgens in eggs and, thus, may exert a complementary effect to yolk androgens.  2006 by The University of Chicago.

In many animal populations a small proportion of individuals produce the majority of surviving offspring, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Behaviour may be an important determinant of variation in fitness: 'high-quality' individuals may have enhanced abilities in foraging or predator and parasite avoidance. 2. The role of behaviour in determining variation in quality was examined using the common guillemot Uria aalge, a monogamous seabird with biparental care. Using a novel mixed model approach, we analysed binary data on breeding success of each pair attempting to breed in each year with variables critical to breeding success (timing of breeding; inferred age; breeding experience and success; number of nest sites and partners) as fixed effects. Random effects for year, male, female and each distinct pairing of a male and a female were included in the model, allowing a quality estimate to be derived for each individual and pair. A range of behaviours associated with breeding were examined in relation to these quality estimates. 3. Breeding success declined with timing of breeding, and increased initially with age before declining in old age. It increased with previous successful experience, not breeding experience per se, until senescence effects became apparent. For males, breeding success declined with increasing numbers of mates. 4. The most important behavioural determinants of quality operated at the level of the pair, with the time mates spent together at the site and chick feeding rates both positively related to quality. At the individual level, trip durations and feeding rates were associated with female but not male quality, suggesting that pair quality was operating principally through the female. However, removal of laying date, the most important component in the binomial model, confirmed that the pair effect was much larger than the female effect. 5. This study demonstrates the potential of mixed modelling to determine quality estimates based on long-term breeding histories. The probability of a successful reproductive attempt was explained by the timing of breeding, age, successful breeding experience and number of mates. Behaviour was an important proximate mechanism underlying quality, in particular the foraging abilities of the pair, and the female's contribution to offspring provisioning. In species with biparental care, behavioural correlates of quality operate most strongly at the scale of the breeding pair, because contributions from both individuals are required for a successful outcome.  2006 The Authors."

Here we examine reproductive tradeoffs and their association with yolk steroids in an oviparous lizard. Female leopard geckos lay two eggs in a clutch, produce multiple clutches in a breeding season, and reproduce for several years. We detected a significant tradeoff between egg size and the number of clutches laid by females during their first two breeding seasons. Total reproductive effort was strongly condition-dependent in the first season, but much less so in the second season. Although these and other tradeoffs were unmistakable, they were not associated with levels of androstenedione, oestradiol, or testosterone in egg yolk. Female condition and egg size, however, were inversely related to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels in egg yolk. Finally, steroid levels in egg yolk were not directly related to steroid levels in the maternal circulation when follicles were developing, indicating that steroid transfer to eggs is regulated. These findings suggest that maternal allocation of DHT could mitigate tradeoffs that lead to poor offspring quality (i.e. poor female condition) and small offspring size (i.e. small egg size).  2006 The Authors."

According to life-history theory, reproduction is costly, and individuals that invest too much in a given reproductive bout pay with reduced reproductive output in the future. Likewise, investing too little does not maximize reproductive potential. Because reproductive effort relative to output can vary with predictable and unpredictable challenges and opportunities, no single level of reproductive effort maximizes fitness. This leads to the prediction that individuals possessing behavioural mechanisms to buffer challenges and take advantage of opportunities would incur fitness benefits. Here, we review evidence in birds, primarily of altricial species, for the presence of at least two such mechanisms and evidence for and against the seasonal coordination of these mechanisms through seasonal changes in plasma concentrations of the pituitary hormone prolactin. First, the seasonal decline in clutch size of most bird species may partially offset a predictable seasonal decline in the reproductive value of offspring. Second, establishing a developmental sibling-hierarchy among offspring may hedge against unpredictable changes in resource availability and offspring viability or quality, and minimize energy expenditure in raising a brood. The hierarchy may be a product, in part, of the timing of incubation onset relative to clutch completion and the rate of yolk androgen deposition during the laying cycle. Because clutch size should influence the effects of both these traits on the developmental hierarchy, we predicted and describe evidence in some species that females adjust the timing of incubation onset and rate of yolk androgen deposition to match clutch size. Studies on domesticated precocial species reveal an inhibitory effect of the pituitary hormone prolactin on egg laying, suggesting a possible hormonal basis for the regulation of clutch size. Studies on the American kestrel (Falco sparverius) and other species suggest that the seasonal increase in plasma concentrations of prolactin may regulate both a seasonal advance in the timing of incubation onset and a seasonal increase in the rate of yolk androgen deposition. These observations, together with strong conceptual arguments published previously, raise the possibility that a single hormone, prolactin, functions as the basis of a common mechanism for the seasonal adjustment of reproductive effort. However, a role for prolactin in regulating clutch size in any species is not firmly established, and evidence from some species indicates that clutch size may not be coupled to the timing of incubation onset and rate of yolk androgen deposition. A dissociation between the regulation of clutch size and the regulation of incubation onset and yolk androgen deposition may enable an independent response to the predictable and unpredictable challenges and opportunities faced during reproduction.  2006 Cambridge Philosophical Society."

In this study of the grey partridge, we conducted two supplementation experiments: (1) laying females were fed with -carotene enriched or impoverished diets; (2) chicks were fed directly with -carotene enriched or impoverished diets. We then evaluated the effects of this carotenoid on chick growth, immunocompetence and anti-predator behaviour (reactions to a raptor model). In the first experiment, the -carotene enriched diet given to mothers did not cause any difference in chick physiology. In the second experiment, -carotene supplementation of chicks had a significant beneficial effect on their growth and immune response, although their behavioural reactions did not differ in relation to the diet. Therefore, -carotene supplementation had beneficial effects on growth and immunocompetence only when directly supplied to chicks.

To test this, we experimentally modified parental nutritional conditions by supplementary feeding of yellow-legged gulls during egg formation, to evaluate sex-biassed environmental sensitivity of gull embryos. We found that eggs were larger in supplemented clutches, but egg size did not affect embryo survival. Survival of male gull embryos was more related to parental food conditions than was survival of female embryos.

The immune system of newly hatched birds is relatively immature; therefore pathogens can be particularly virulent. Females transfer passive immunity in terms of immunoglobulins to the eggs to protect their young against infections in the crucial early life stages. 2. As transmission of antibodies is likely to be nutritionally costly, mothers are expected to allocate these components differentially to eggs according to their own condition, the quality of their mate or the laying order of eggs. 3. We found that in Collared Flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis), yolk antibody levels positively correlated with female body condition, but showed no relationship with maternal age or body size. Furthermore, females with higher plasma heterophil:lymphocyte ratio and heterophil count, which may indicate higher level of stress, deposited lower amount of immunoglobulins to their eggs. These results suggest that females of better physiological condition were able to invest more immunoglobulins to their eggs. 4. Neither the plumage characteristics, nor the age of the male parent was related to yolk antibody concentration, and thus no evidence for differential allocation of antibodies in relation to male quality or attractiveness could be detected. 5.

We studied the consequences of an immune challenge in reproductive female dragons, Ctenophorus fordi, and in their offspring by exposing lizards to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). 3. The immune challenge led to decreased reproductive investment in terms of egg mass, but with no effect on probability of future reproduction. 4. Maternal immune challenge did not influence the response of their offspring to the same challenge. However, juveniles that were induced to mount an immune response had a higher thermal preference and showed reduced growth, but the magnitude of the growth effect was dependent on the date of oviposition, indicating maternal effects on offspring immunity. 5.

Sex allocation theory has proved to be successful in some invertebrate taxa but data on vertebrates often fail to show the predicted shift in sex ratio or sex-specific resource investment. This is likely to be partly explained by simplistic assumptions of vertebrate life-history and mechanistic constraints, but also because the fundamental assumption of sex-specific fitness return on investment is rarely supported by empirical data. In short-lived species, the time of hatching or parturition can have a strong impact on the age and size at maturity. Thus, if selection favors adult sexual-size dimorphism, females can maximize their fitness by adjusting offspring sex over the reproductive season. We show that in mallee dragons, Ctenophorus fordi, date of hatching is positively related to female reproductive output but has little, if any, effect on male reproductive success, suggesting selection for a seasonal shift in offspring sex ratio. We used a combination of field and laboratory data collected over two years to test if female dragons adjust their sex allocation over the season to ensure an adaptive match between time of hatching and offspring sex. Contrary to our predictions, we found no effect of laying date on sex ratio, nor did we find any evidence for within-female between-clutch sex-ratio adjustment. Furthermore, there was no differential resource investment into male and female offspring within or between clutches and sex ratios did not correlate with female condition or any partner traits. Consequently, despite evidence for selection for a seasonal sex-ratio shift, female mallee dragons do not seem to exercise any control over sex determination. The results are discussed in relation to potential constraints on sex-ratio adjustment, alternative selection pressures, and the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination.  2006 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

When relative importance of these effects varies across environments, evolution of developmental periods is expected to be slow. In birds, maternal effects on egg-laying order and offspring growth, two proximate determinants of nestling period, should enable rapid adjustment of developmental periods to even widely fluctuating mortality rates. We test this hypothesis in a population of house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) breeding under two contrasting mortality risks: (i) a nest mite-free condition when selection on offspring survival favors a longer time in the nest; and (ii) a mite infestation when selection favors a shorter nest tenure. Mites affected survival of sons more than daughters, and females breeding under mite infestation laid male eggs last and female eggs first in the clutch, thereby reducing sons' exposure to mites and associated mortality. Strong sex bias in laying order and growth patterns enabled mite-infested offspring to achieve similar fledging size, despite a shorter nest tenure, compared with mite-free conditions. In mite-infested nests, male nestlings hatched at larger sizes, completed growth earlier, and had faster initial growth compared with mite-free nests, whereas mite-infested females grew more slowly but for a longer period of time. A combination of heavily sex-biased laying order and sex differences in growth patterns lowered mite-induced mortality by >10% in both sexes. Thus, strong maternal effects can account for frequently observed, but theoretically unexpected, concordance of mortality risks and growth patterns, especially under fluctuating ecological conditions.  2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA."

Analysis of bioptic yolk samples from clutches that were subsequently partially cross-fostered revealed a positive effect of yolk antioxidant capacity on embryonic development and chick growth, but not on immunity and begging behaviour, while controlling for parentage and common environment effects.

At laying, we experimentally increased the concentration of yolk testosterone (T) within the natural range of variation, and, shortly before hatching, we compared the structural properties, rate, and loudness of vocalizations of embryos developing in T- and oil-injected (control) eggs. In addition, we compared the early post-hatch begging rate (measured as the pecking rate towards a dummy gull head) in chicks of the two experimental groups. We found that T embryos produced louder embryonic vocalizations than controls, whereas structural properties and the calling rate did not differ between T and control embryos. The post-hatch begging rate was unaffected by T treatment, but strongly decreased with increasing chick body mass, suggesting that intensity of the begging display was sensitive to chick state and may therefore reliably indicate the need of food in this species. Therefore, the results of this study show for the first time that prenatal T exposure modulates the quality of embryonic vocalizations, but are not in accordance with previous findings reporting increased post-hatching begging intensity following increased prenatal exposure to androgens.  2006 Elsevier Inc.

In many animals immunity is not fully developed until adulthood but the young still need protection against various sets of pathogens. Thus, bird nestlings are highly dependent on antibodies received from their mother (in the eggs) during their rapid early growth period. The relationship between maternal immunity and the development of neonates' own immunity has been poorly studied. 2. It has been suggested that immune function plays an important part in mediating resource competition between different life-history traits, e.g. growth and reproduction. Maternal investment of antibodies has potentially permanent effects on offspring phenotype. Thus, the trade-offs between the immune function and other important life-history traits in the offspring will also affect the fitness of the mother. 3. Our supplemental feeding experiment in the magpie Pica pica indicates that the immunoglobulin levels of offspring at hatching are dependent on a mother's nutritional condition. In addition, the amount of maternal immunoglobulins transferred to offspring increases along the laying order within a nest. 4. We also found that at the age of 8-10 days the immunoglobulin production of the offspring has already begun. Furthermore, the maternal immunoglobulin levels of the offspring at hatching were positively related to their immunoglobulin levels on day 10. 5. Maternal immunoglobulins did not significantly affect offspring growth, but there was a negative relationship between self-produced immunoglobulins and growth over the first 10 days, indicating a trade-off between these traits. Nestlings' weight, however, had a positive relationship with immunoglobulin production suggesting that the observed trade-off between growth and immunoglobulin production is due to catch-up growth of nestlings with a low hatching weight. We found that within nests nestlings with higher maternal antibody levels had higher survival rate until day 20, but between nests there was an opposite relationship. 6. Evidently, there is a trade-off, in magpies, between maternal resources, immune function and growth, shaping the evolution of maternal investment in offspring immunity.  2006 The Authors."

Experimental tests have, however, yielded results that range from full compensation, through a lack of any reaction, to a matching response. Here we suggest a new, adaptive explanation for such variation. Building on an approach developed by McNamara et al., we incorporate uncertainty regarding brood need or value into a game-theoretical model of biparental negotiation over offspring care. We show that when each parent has only partial information, greater effort invested by one serves as a signal to the other of brood need. This favors a matching response by the focal parent's mate, whereas the impact of increased effort on the marginal value of investment favors a compensatory response. The net outcome depends on the relative strength of these two effects. The greater the variation in brood need compared with parental state, the weaker the predicted level of compensation, and the more likely matching is to occur. Our model also suggests why males and females might respond differently to each other. If there is an informational asymmetry between them, then the parent that is better informed about brood need should work harder, respond more strongly to changes in brood need, be less sensitive to changes in the cost of feeding, and compensate more strongly for changes in partner effort. If the asymmetry is very great, the poorly informed parent may even match changes in its partner's work rate.  The Author 2006.

This suggests that their immunocompetence is not limited by access to resources, and they can differentially invest in immune response with increasing risk of parasitism. On the other hand, immune response of junior nestlings was related to their body condition, but secondarily also to risk of parasitism. Our results agree with previous studies that have found significant influence of nutritional status and risk of parasitism on nestlings immune defence, but show that the effects of these environmental factors on nestling immunocompetence differ between nestlings occupying high and low rank positions in size hierarchies.

We found that male, second-hatched, and large eggs showed shorter hatching periods than female, first-hatched, and small eggs. We also found a male-biased mortality of nestlings in the colony. However, male mortality patterns differed depending on the brood sex ratio composition. Mortality of male chicks in all-male broods was higher than in mixed broods and higher than female mortality in all-female broods. Contrary, females from mixed brood showed higher mortality than their male nest mates and higher too than females in all-female broods. Second-hatched chicks also suffered from higher mortality than first-hatched chicks. Our results indicate that both the superior competitive capacity and the higher energy demand of the larger sex constitute 2 causal factors explaining patterns of sex-biased mortality. Both factors occur in the same species and in different situations of sibling competition shaped by brood sex ratio composition.

The age of the male at the nest of origin, but not that of the rearing male, had a year-dependent effect on nestling body mass and tarsus length. In two seasons, young of subadult males grew slower in the early linear phase of growth than young of adult males. There was no compensatory growth in the final asymptotic phase, so both body mass and tarsus length before fledging reflected the differential early development. In the remaining year, the age of the male at the nest of origin had no significant effect on chick growth. The environment-dependent origin effect we detected was unexplained by incubation times, hatching asynchrony, chick masses at swapping or previously described age-dependent egg quality patterns. Our results therefore suggest a genotype x environment interaction on the relative development of offspring sired by subadult and adult males. Our results also raise the possibility that female birds may gain genetic benefits by mating with older males. Further studies should identify general patterns of male age-dependent female mate choice and offspring quality in different environmental conditions.  Springer-Verlag 2006."

The LR axis links biomolecular chirality to embryonic development and ultimately to behavior and cognition, revealing feedback loops and conserved functional modules occurring as widely as plants and mammals. This review focuses on the unique and fascinating physiological aspects of LR patterning in a number of vertebrate and invertebrate species, discusses several profound mechanistic analogies between biological regulation in diverse systems (specifically proposing a nonciliary parallel between kidney cells and the LR axis based on subcellular regulation of ion transporter targeting), high-lights the possible importance of early, highly-conserved intracellular events that are magnified to embryo-wide scales, and lays out the most important open questions about the function, evolutionary origin, and conservation of mechanisms underlying embryonic asymmetry.  2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

In the present cross-fostering experiment with great tits Parus major, we investigate pre- and postnatal parental effects (egg yolk carotenoids, parental coloration) on nestling size and carotenoid coloration, using HPLC analysis of egg yolk carotenoids, and a reflectance-based measure of 'chroma' that reflects the plumage pigment concentration. Both rearing environment and origin influenced offspring size and plumage chroma. Maternal allocation of carotenoids to eggs had a weak positive effect on nestling plumage chroma, whereas we found no prenatal maternal effects (egg size or yolk carotenoid concentration) on size. Nestling plumage chroma was also significantly predicted by the chroma of the rearing father, but not by the color of the rearing mother or either of the original (genetical) parents. Thus, both prenatal maternal effects and postnatal paternal effects influence the carotenoid-based plumage coloration of nestling great tits. Future studies will reveal if parental effects have long-term consequences for plumage development and associated fitness components.  Springer-Verlag 2006."

In birds, such allocation can be accomplished either by temporal clustering of ova that become the same sex, resulting in sex-biased egg-laying order, or by follicle-specific delivery of maternal resources. Two house finch populations at the northern and southern boundaries of the species range have opposite ovulation sequences of male and female eggs, and thus, in the absence of sex differences in ova growth or sex-specific maternal strategies, would be expected to have opposite sex-specific accumulation of maternal products. We found that the populations had strong and similar gradients of steroid distribution in relation to ovulation order, whereas distribution of carotenoids and vitamins correlated with each follicle's accumulation of steroids. In both populations, temporal bias in production of sons and daughters within a clutch enabled strongly sex-specific acquisition of maternal products, and oocytes of the same sex were highly interdependent in their accumulation of steroids. Moreover, in nests where the sex-bias in relation to ovulation order deviated from population-specific patterns, eggs had highly distinct concentrations of steroids, carotenoids and vitamins. These results and previous findings of sex-specific yolk partitioning among oocytes suggest that oocytes that become males and females are temporally or spatially clustered during their ovarian growth.

Yolk antioxidant and immunoglobulin concentrations decreased across the laying order, while yolk testosterone concentrations increased. This may substantially handicap the immune defence of last-hatched chicks. The decrease in antioxidant levels was greater when mothers had a low body mass and when the increase in testosterone concentrations was relatively large. This suggests that female black-headed gulls are constrained in the deposition of antioxidants in last-laid eggs and compensate for this by enhanced testosterone deposition.

Female birds deposit variable amounts of androgens in the yolks of their eggs, and it has been suggested that yolk androgen deposition is an adaptive mechanism preparing offspring for a competitive environment. Breeding pairs of Eastern Bluebirds (Sialia sialis) Linnaeus were stimulated with an intruder presentation while ovarian follicles were developing. Yolk steroid concentrations in eggs laid by stimulated females were then compared with yolk steroid concentrations in eggs laid by control females. Additionally, blood samples taken from a subset of control and stimulated females were analysed for plasma steroid hormone concentrations. We predicted that female bluebirds experiencing a simulated intrusion would experience increased levels of circulating plasma androgens that would be reflected by larger amounts of androgens deposited in their eggs compared with control females. 2. Patterns of steroid concentrations differed between egg yolks and female plasma. In egg yolks, androstenedione was the predominant hormone, followed by testosterone. Yolks contained minimal amounts of both corticosterone and oestradiol. In female plasma, however, corticosterone was the predominant hormone, while sex steroids were found at low levels. 3. Yolk steroid concentrations did not vary with laying order in either the control or the stimulated group, a result expected due to the relatively synchronous nature of incubation behaviour exhibited by Eastern Bluebird females. 4. Yolk androgen concentrations in eggs laid by stimulated females were significantly higher than in those laid by control females, suggesting that females increase yolk androgen deposition in response to aggressive encounters. 5. Females exposed to an intruder presentation contained significantly lower levels of plasma androgens than control females. We suggest that the deposition of androgens in the eggs serves as an adaptive method of regulating circulating androgen levels in the female, preventing potentially disruptive elevations in circulating androgen concentrations during a particularly sensitive period in the reproductive cycle.  2006 British Ecological Society."

To evaluate whether the level of maternal androgens affects the offspring sex ratio, we injected female zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, with testosterone during egg laying. The sex ratio of eggs laid after testosterone administration became significantly male biased, compared to eggs laid by control females that received a vehicle injection. However, sons of testosterone-treated females suffered lower hatching success. In contrast, daughters seemed to benefit from elevated androgen level in terms of future survival prospects. The opposite effects on male and female offspring may constitute an important constraint on maternal androgen allocation to the eggs and reduce the benefits of biasing the sex ratio towards males by increasing the testosterone level.  2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour."

Fitness can be maximized directly by increasing the number of offspring (direct benefits) or indirectly by maximizing offspring's lifetime reproductive success (indirect benefits). Whereas there is considerable evidence in the literature for the influence of mating decisions on direct benefits, indirect benefits have been more elusive. Here, we review the variables that influence mating decisions made by females of freshwater fish and how these affect their fitness directly, as well as indirectly. Females enhance their fitness by matching their mating decisions to current environmental conditions, using a wide range of pre- and post-copulation mechanisms that enable them to maximize benefits from mating. Male sexual traits and courtship displays are signals used by females as a way of assessing male quality in terms of both direct and indirect benefits. Polyandry is very common among freshwater fish species, and indirect benefits have been hypothesized as drivers of its predominance. Despite intensive theoretical work, and multiple suggestions of the effects of indirect benefits, to date no study has been able to demonstrate experimentally the existence of indirect benefits in freshwater fish species. Additionally, most studies of direct benefits measure short-term benefits of mating decisions. In both cases, lifetime reproductive success is not assessed. Therefore, we are led to conclude that evidence as to whether female mating decisions result in direct and/or indirect benefits in freshwater fish species is still lacking. These results should be considered in light of the ongoing debate about the significance of indirect benefits in female mating decisions.  2006 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles."

Here, we present details of an experiment in which we manipulated levels of testosterone, 17-oestradiol and corticosterone in breeding female Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) using Silastic implants and looked for effects on the sex ratio of offspring produced. Offspring sex ratio in this species was significantly correlated with faecal concentrations of the principal avian stress hormone, corticosterone, and artificially elevated levels of corticosterone resulted in significantly female-biased sex ratios at laying. Varying testosterone and 17-oestradiol had no effect on sex ratio alone, and faecal levels of these hormones did not vary in response to corticosterone.

Experiments in several species have reported that females invest greater amounts of androgens in the eggs fathered by attractive males, suggesting that yolk androgen is a costly investment for either the offspring or the mother. There is some evidence that nestling immunocompetence may be partially suppressed by high levels of yolk androgens, but it is not known whether this is also the case for females. We tested this hypothesis in the house martin by inducing an immune challenge through an injection of sheep red blood cells, a standard challenge of the humoral immune system. Experimental birds laid eggs with lower amounts of yolk androstenedione than controls, and there was a similar non-significant trend for testosterone. Furthermore, the probability of laying a replacement clutch was higher for birds that had laid a first clutch with relatively high levels of yolk testosterone.

In barn swallows (Hirundo rustica), absolute and relative albumen mass increased with egg laying order. Experimental albumen removal delayed hatching, had larger negative effects on growth of late-hatched nestlings, and reduced nestling survival. Laying order positively predicted hatch order. Because nestling competitive ability depends on size, and albumen egg content influences hatchling size, present results suggest that by increasing albumen content of late eggs mothers reduce hatching asynchrony and enhance growth particularly of late-hatched nestlings. Thus, variation in albumen mass with laying order may function to mitigate the negative phenotypic consequences of hatching late in species that adopt a 'brood-survival' strategy.  2005 European Society for Evolutionary Biology."

Analyses indicated strong prenatal and post-natal plasticity in body size per se and yielded three main results with respect to SSD. First, SSD in juvenile common lizards matches qualitatively the SSD observed in adults. Secondly, SSD was influenced by none of the prenatal factors investigated here, suggesting poor sex-biased maternal effects on offspring size. Thirdly, SSD was sensitive to post-natal habitat humidity, which positively affected growth rate more strongly in females than in males. Thus, natural variation in SSD in juvenile common lizards appears to be primarily determined by a combination of sex-biased genetic factors and post-natal conditions.

We compared resource acquisition among oocytes in relation to their future sex and ovulation order in two populations of house finches with contrasting sex-biased maternal strategies.

The reasons for this are likely to be linked to simplifying assumptions regarding vertebrate life histories. More specifically, if the sex ratio adjustment itself influences offspring fitness, due to sex-specific interactions among offspring, this could affect optimal sex ratios. A review of the literature suggests that sex-specific sibling interactions in vertebrates result from three major causes: (i) sex asymmetries in competitive ability, for example due to sexual dimorphism, (ii) sex-specific cooperation or helping, and (iii) sex asymmetries in non-competitive interactions, for example steroid leakage between fetuses. Incorporating sex-specific sibling interactions into a sex ratio model shows that they will affect maternal sex ratio strategies and, under some conditions, can repress other selection pressures for sex ratio adjustment. Furthermore, sex-specific interactions could also explain patterns of within-brood sex ratio (e.g. in relation to laying order). Failure to take sex-specific sibling interactions into account could partly explain the lack of sex ratio adjustment in accordance with theoretical expectations in vertebrates, and differences among taxa in sex-specific sibling interactions generate predictions for comparative and experimental studies.  2006 Cambridge Philosophical Society."

We injected either a physiological dose of testosterone or a control vehicle into house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus) eggs and examined the effects of these injections on offspring growth and immunity. Two days after hatching, nestlings from eggs treated with testosterone were significantly larger than nestlings from eggs treated with a control injection, suggesting a stimulatory effect of yolk androgens in early development.

Nestlings in the testosterone treatment group showed a significantly larger swelling response to phytohemagglutinin than control nestlings 15 d after hatching, which is close to fledging.

In this study, we report on sexual dimorphism in 2D:3D, 2D:4D, and 3D:4D contralateral ratios of the forelimbs in two species of oviparous lizards, the common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) and the tree skink (Mabuya planifrons), as measured on museum specimens. We found that male P. muralis had a larger 2D:4D ratio on both sides and larger 2D:3D ratio on the left side than females, whereas in M. planifrons, males had lower 2D:3D ratios than females on the left side. The two species show opposite patterns of sexual dimorphism in body size, males being larger than females in P. muralis, and the reverse in M. planifrons, suggesting that interspecific variation of sex differences in digit ratios could be associated with sex-specific growth trajectories. There was a limited evidence for directional asymmetry in digit ratios. Therefore, our findings provide the first evidence that digit ratios are sexually dimorphic in any reptile species and are consistent with the idea that the genetic link between limb development and the urogenital system had been established with the evolution of the earliest terrestrial tetrapods. Importantly, many lizard species with genetic sex determination, including the ones we studied, are oviparous and may represent valuable animal models for experimental tests of the association between prenatal exposure to androgens or estrogens and digit ratios.  2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

We compared the sex-specific growth of the last-hatched, competitively disadvantaged chicks with that of synchronously hatched chicks in two successive years. Sons exhibited higher growth rates than daughters in a year with delayed onset of breeding, and this sex-related difference was more pronounced among the asynchronously hatched chicks. Females apparently do not selectively allocate more resources to the last-laid eggs because neonatal body mass and the growth rate of asynchronously hatched chicks did not differ between years, despite the fact that in one of the years, asynchronous chicks hatched from replaced eggs taken randomly from other nests and not from eggs laid last by the incubating female. Among chicks that survived, moderately asynchronous siblings grew at a lower rate than synchronous ones, whereas no difference in mass gain was revealed between synchronous and strongly asynchronous siblings irrespective of their contrasting competitive abilities. We suggest that selection of the fittest asynchronous chicks may improve the overall quality of asynchronous broods, thus favouring the maintenance of asynchronous hatching strategies in variable environments.

Maternal effects mediated by prenatal hormone exposure are potentially important for non-genetic inheritance of phenotypic traits related to social rank3, and thus for shaping individual variation in behaviour and social structure. Here we show that androgen concentrations in wild female spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) are higher during late gestation in dominant females than in subordinate females. Furthermore, both male and female cubs born to mothers with high concentrations of androgens in late pregnancy exhibit higher rates of aggression and mounting behaviour than cubs born to mothers with lower androgen concentrations. Both behaviours are strongly affected in other mammals by organizational effects of androgens4, and both have important effects on fitness in hyaenas. Therefore, our results suggest that rank-related maternal effects of prenatal androgen exposure can adaptively influence offspring phenotype in mammals, as has previously been shown to occur in birds. They also suggest an organizational mechanism for the development of female dominance and aggressiveness in spotted hyaenas, traits that may offset the costs of extreme virilization.  2006 Nature Publishing Group."

In the experiments with females of poor condition, when broods were supplied with extra food none of the nestlings died, whereas in control broods, which were not supplied with extra food, some nestlings did die. Large differences in testosterone levels were correlated positively with hatching order both in experimental and control broods.

In the experiments with females of good condition, the males were removed and females and their broods were supplied with restricted amounts of food. In these broods starving nestlings, whose growth had stopped, were considered as having died and were removed from the nest and hand-reared. In control broods all nestlings fledged, and both in experimental and control broods testosterone concentrations were more even between siblings. Both types of trials confirmed a maternal influence on offspring testosterone concentration: large between-sibling differences in concentrations in the broods of females of poor condition, where some nestlings died, could not be reduced with increased food supply, and the more even concentrations in the broods of females in good condition, where all nestlings survived, could also not be increased by restricting the food supply.  2006 Blackwell Verlag."

For example, in mammals, offspring from stressed mothers show a variety of changes in behavioural, morphological, and life-history traits. The effects of maternal stress on trait development are believed to be mediated via transfer of glucocorticoids, the main hormones released during the stress response, from mother to offspring. However, also other physiological maternal responses during stress could be responsible for changes in offspring phenotype. We investigated the direct effects of corticosterone on offspring development, without other confounding factors related to increased maternal stress, by injection of corticosterone in eggs of the ovoviviparous lizard Lacerta vivipara. Corticosterone-manipulated offspring did not show impaired development, reduced body size or body condition at parturition. However, corticosterone-treated offspring showed altered anti-predator behaviour, as measured by the time required to emerge from shelter after a simulated predator attack. Differential steroid exposure during development, possibly mediated by maternal stress response, may explain some of the variation in behaviour among individuals in natural populations.  2006 Blackwell Verlag."

Egg laying is costly for birds, as eggs must contain all the energy and nutrients needed by the developing embryo. As nutrients are limiting, there is a conflict between provisioning eggs and conserving nutrients for future health and survival. 2. Life-history theory suggests that females should choose how to invest resources in relation to the value of the reproductive attempt. Females may manipulate egg composition in relation to the attractiveness of their mate, ensuring chick survival and assuming that the offspring will themselves be more attractive and have higher reproductive success. Antioxidants are an important component of egg composition: they are vital for embryonic and posthatching chick development and survival. 3. Here we demonstrate that female Zebra Finches (Taeniopygia guttata) mated to attractive males deposit more carotenoids and alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) in later-laid eggs, shown by a significant interaction between laying order and antioxidant concentration. This bias may increase the probability of chick survival from later-laid eggs and potentially the lifetime reproductive success of the laying female. 4. The body condition of the laying female, measured as fat reserves, was found to be a significant predictor of yolk carotenoid concentration but not of yolk alpha-tocopherol concentration.  2006 British Ecological Society."

If chicks have some control over the timing of hatching, however, they might be able to compensate at least partly for the hatching spread. In this study on lesser black-backed gulls, Larus fuscus, we examined whether the timing of hatching varied with laying order. To separate their effects, we manipulated the hatching order relative to the laying order within broods of three chicks. We exchanged eggs between nests, so that chicks from first-laid eggs hatched last, and chicks from last-laid eggs hatched first. When hatching last, chicks from last-laid eggs took significantly less time to hatch than chicks from first-laid eggs. However, hatching duration did not differ between chicks from first- and last-laid eggs when hatching first. Hence, only offspring from last-laid eggs had the ability to accelerate hatching, and they did this only when their siblings had already hatched. Accelerated hatching might benefit the last-laid offspring by reducing hatching intervals, but it also resulted in low hatchling mass. As this ability to accelerate hatching was not found in first-laid offspring, differences in intrinsic egg quality may be responsible for hatching duration. Differences in egg quality, however, arise from differential allocation of resources across the laying sequence by the parent and may hence suggest a parental strategy to alleviate the detrimental effects of within-brood hierarchies on the last-hatching chick.  2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Measurements of phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced tissue swelling are arguably the most popular surrogates for immunocompetence in wild birds. It is largely unresolved, however, whether the basic assumption underlying these measures is valid, particularly whether more swelling represents a 'better' or 'stronger' cell-mediated immune response. 2. In this study we took a first step towards such validation by characterizing immune cell infiltration over time into the wing-webs (patagia) of PHA-challenged House Sparrows (Passer domesticus). Relative to saline-injected wing-webs, PHA-injected wing-webs displayed intensive infiltration of many immune cell types, including basophils, eosinophils, heterophils, lymphocytes, macrophages and thrombocytes. The abundance of most of these cell types changed over the course of the swelling response (6-48 h post-injection). Peak infiltration time varied depending on cell type. At several time points, significant correlations between the numbers of some cell types (particularly heterophils) and the degree of swelling were detected. 3. Together, these data indicate that PHA-induced swelling is related to heightened immune cell activity in House Sparrows, but also that the PHA swelling response in this species is dynamic and involves both innate and adaptive components of the immune system. We thus caution against interpreting larger swellings as 'greater cell-mediated immunocompetence', given the complex nature of this immune response.  2006 British Ecological Society."

Here, we show experimentally that in Black-headed gulls maternal androgens in the egg enhance the development of the nuptial plumage and the frequency of aggressive and sexual displays almost 1 year after hatching.

Maternal androgens in the eggs of vertebrates may mediate such adaptive early maternal effects. However, the evolution of early maternal effects mediated by egg androgens may be constrained by the inability of mothers to differentially allocate androgens to eggs with a male or a female if androgens have different effects on sons and daughters. In this study, we increased the concentration of androgens in the eggs of barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) within the physiological range of variation and analyzed the effect on nestling growth and begging behavior. Egg androgens increased body size and mass of sons but reduced these characters in daughters when compared to two control groups in a repeated-measures analysis of variance of data collected at different ages. However, the differential effect of androgen on the two sexes was no longer significant when the analysis was restricted to the age of 12 days, when final body size is attained. In a second experiment, we tested whether mothers differentially allocated androgens to eggs with sons rather than daughters while manipulating a paternal secondary sexual character. Androgen concentration did not vary in relation to paternal ornamentation or embryo sex. Hence, antagonistic effects of egg androgens on sons and daughters may exist in the very early posthatching life and may constrain the evolution of adaptive maternal effects because mothers do not differentially allocate androgens in relation to embryo sex.

To detect patterns of shape evolution, one must assess the quantitative genetic underpinnings of shape variation as well as the selective environment that the organisms have experienced. Here we used geometric morphometrics to assess variation in plastron shell shape in 1314 neonatal slider turtles (Trachemys scripta) from 162 clutches of laboratory-incubated eggs from two nesting areas. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated that nesting area has a limited role in describing plastron shape variation among clutches, whereas differences between individual clutches were highly significant, suggesting a prominent clutch effect. The covariation between plastron shape and several possible maternal effect variables (yolk hormone levels and egg dimensions) was assessed for a subset of clutches and found to be negligible. We subsequently employed several recently proposed methods for estimating heritability from shape variables, and generalized a univariate approach to accommodate unequal sample sizes. Univariate estimates of shape heritability based on Procrustes distances yielded large values for both nesting populations (h2  0.86), and multivariate estimates of maximal additive heritability were also large for both nesting populations (hmax2  0.57). We also estimated the dominant trend in heritable shape change for each nesting population and found that the direction of shape evolution was not the same for the two sites. Therefore, although the magnitude of shape evolution was similar between nesting populations, the manner in which plastron shape is evolving is not. We conclude that the univariate approach for assessing quantitative genetic parameters from geometric morphometric data has limited utility, because it is unable to accurately describe how shape is evolving.  2006 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

In many species, males challenged with simulated or real territorial intrusions increase T and levels of aggression, outcomes linked to higher dominance status and greater reproductive success. For females, the patterns are less clear. Females behave aggressively towards one another, and in some species, females respond to a social challenge with increases in T, but in other species they do not. Prior work on female dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) had shown that experimental elevation of T increases social status and intrasexual aggression. Here, we conducted two experiments designed to answer three questions: Are endogenous concentrations of T associated with dominance status in captive female juncos? Does dominance status influence readiness to breed in female juncos? And do captive females increase T in response to a challenge? In the first experiment, we introduced two females to a breeding aviary, allowed them to form a dominance relationship and then introduced a male. We found that dominant females were more likely to breed than subordinates, but that dominance status was not predicted by circulating T. In the second experiment, we allowed a resident male and female to establish ownership of a breeding aviary (territory) then introduced a second, intruder female. We found that resident females were aggressive towards and dominant over intruders, but T did not increase during aggressive interactions. We suggest that during the breeding season, intrasexual aggression between females may influence reproductive success, but not be dependent upon fluctuations in T. Selection may have favored independence of aggression from T because high concentrations of T could interfere with normal ovulation or produce detrimental maternal effects.  2005 Elsevier Inc.

Prenatal T levels were increased by injecting the yolk of unincubated eggs with physiological doses of the hormone. Yolk T injection resulted in a reduced length of male tarsal spurs, a trait which positively predicts male success in intra- and intersexual selection and viability, whereas no direct effect on male wattle characteristics or plumage traits of either sex was observed. Female spur length was also negatively affected by T, but to a lesser extent than in males. In addition, the covariation between male secondary sexual traits, which are reliable quality indicators, differed between T and control males, suggesting that the manipulation may have altered the assessment of overall male quality by other males and females. In conclusion, the negative effects of elevated yolk T on spur length, a trait which positively predicts male fitness, coupled with the lack of effects on growth or other traits in both sexes, provided limited evidence for mothers being subjected to a trade-off between positive and negative consequences of yolk T deposition on offspring traits and suggest that directional selection for reduced yolk T levels may occur in the ring-necked pheasant.

Poorer performance in young compared with older age classes is common among iteroparous animals, and may result from age effects acting on different phases of reproduction. However, such effects have generally not been teased apart, and as a result their separate consequences for offspring fitness have remained unclear. 2. We tested whether young and mature Herring Gulls produce offspring of different quality due to differences in their egg-production capacity. An experimental protocol was used to standardize incubation and rearing conditions. 3. Eggs laid by young females were smaller than eggs of mature birds. They had a reduced absolute amount of albumen, which reflected mainly lower water content. 4. Within the young age class, female eggs were smaller than male eggs and had significantly paler yolk. This was due to young birds having reduced water content of the albumen, as well as carotenoid content in eggs containing a female embryo. In the mature class there were no such differences in resource allocation in relation to embryo sex. The sex ratio of clutches did not vary with parental age. 5. Hatchlings from eggs produced by young pairs were smaller skeletally but had similar mass to hatchlings from eggs laid by mature birds. When reared by mature foster parents, they did not differ in structural growth or survival. However, they showed a different pattern of growth in body mass. 6. Our results suggest that poorer reproductive performance of young breeders is not simply a consequence of poorer egg quality, as this was largely compensated for when the eggs of young pairs were incubated and reared by mature foster parents. However, it is also possible that adverse effects of lower egg quality are not manifest in the offspring until later in life.  2006 British Ecological Society."

We therefore predicted that especially sons benefit from elevated yolk androgens. Eggs were injected with testosterone or sesame oil (controls) after 2 days of incubation.

Testosterone-treated eggs took longer to hatch than control eggs. Control males begged significantly longer than females during the first days after hatching and grew significantly faster. These sex differences were reduced in offspring from testosterone-treated eggs due to prolonged begging durations of daughters, enhanced growth of daughters and reduced growth of sons.

We studied the effects of elevated yolk testosterone (T) concentration on survival, development and phenotype of male and female yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) chicks by injecting egg yolks with physiological doses of the hormone. Elevated yolk T resulted in a male-biased post-hatching sex ratio, T-treated clutches producing a greater proportion of males compared to control ones at day 4 post-hatching, likely resulting from a reduction of female embryonic survival, whereas no effect of hormone treatment on hatching success or short-term chick survival was observed. In addition, T depressed post-hatching body mass in both sexes but had no effects on the intensity of the cell-mediated immune response or skeletal growth. No sex differences in egg characteristics or chick phenotype were detected.

We found no support for the first hypothesis proposing that yolk androgen varies as a function of breeding density in order to prepare offspring for different breeding densities. However, we found experimental support for the hypothesis that female yolk androgen allocation depends on mate attractiveness and that it constitutes an example of differential allocation. Females increased the concentration of androgens in their eggs when mated to males with experimentally elongated tails. Female phenotypic quality as measured by arrival date and clutch size was positively related to egg androgen concentration, consistent with the hypothesis that this is a costly investment, constrained by female condition.

Such trait could be considered being mostly under maternal control. Nevertheless, the exact mechanism involved remains undetermined. Knowledge of the mechanism would contribute to any assessment of its cost in terms of resources and/or time, which would be important to formulate predictions of those scenarios where it could have evolved. In fact, small costs of sex ratio control could overcome the adaptive value of adjusting the proportion of sexes in the progeny. Pike and Petrie (2003) published an excellent review on the potential mechanism involved. However, many new experimental and correlational evidences have appeared from that date, providing new and interesting perspectives. Thus, hormonal control is obtaining strong support from recent findings. The present review updates the current knowledge on this subject with emphasis on the question of whether sex ratio manipulation is a widespread trait among avian taxa. Finally, future directions for research, including not only those related to the mechanism per se, but also those linked to conditions necessary for the evolution of this trait, are presented. Thus, the necessity of determining fitness functions of male and female offspring and both parents, as well as the problem of if this trait is the result of a evolutionary constraint or strategy, are also addressed."

Some evidence suggests that yolk androgen deposition may be a costly investment for the female bird. We studied the relationship between female expression of a male ornament and yolk androgen deposition in the pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca. In this species, some females present a white forehead patch, which is an ornament typically restricted to males. Female expression of this trait has previously been found to be associated with older age and low levels of blood parasites. We predicted that, if yolk androgen deposition is costly, eggs from females displaying a white forehead patch should contain higher concentrations of yolk androgens that those laid by females lacking that ornament. Location: La Hiruela, central Spain. Methods:We measured testosterone (T) and androstenedione (A4) levels in 10 pied flycatcher broods, after an ether extraction, following a radioimmunoassay method. Results and Conclusions:We found that yolk T and A4concentrations increased with laying order. However, the increase in A4 with laying order was steeper for females without a forehead patch than for those expressing it. Also, and contrary to expectations, we found a marginally significant trend for females with white foreheads to have lower yolk-T levels.

We show here that juvenile cell-mediated immune response is negatively correlated with subsequent size of an adult sexual ornament in the Chinese quail, Coturnix chinensis.

The purpose of this study was to determine the cause of differences in mean phenotype between two parts of a population of great tits Parus major, separated by <3 km. We conducted a partial cross-fostering experiment between two contrasting parts of this population to separate genetic and environmental sources of variation, and to test for gene-environment interaction. We found strong environmental effects on nestling size, mass and condition index, with nestlings reared in a low density part of the population being larger, heavier and in better condition, than those in a high density part, irrespective of their origin. In addition, we found smaller, but significant, differences in nestling condition and shape associated with the areas that birds originated from, suggesting the presence of genetic differences between parts of this population. There was no evidence of gene-environment interaction for any character. This experiment is thus consistent with previous analyses suggesting that differences between parts of this population had evolved recently, apparently due to phenotype-dependent dispersal, and indicates that population differentiation can be maintained over small spatial scales despite extensive dispersal.  2005 European Society for Evolutionary Biology."

We also estimated survival and sexual selection on the phenotypic value of the trait.

Thus, we investigated the evolutionary associations between maternally derived yolk testosterone (T) and early developmental traits in passerine birds via a comparative, phylogenetic analysis. Our results from species-correlation and independent contrasts analyses provide convergent evidence for the correlated evolution of maternal yolk T concentration and length of the prenatal developmental period in passerines.

Zebra finch digit ratio was found to vary with offspring sex, laying order of eggs within a clutch, and to predict aspects of female mating behaviour. Hence, it was proposed that the measurement of digit ratio would give insights into how an individual's behaviour is shaped by its maternal environment. Studying 500 individuals of a different zebra finch population I set out to: (1) determine the proximate causes of variation in digit ratio by means of quantitative genetics and (2) to search for phenotypic and genetic correlations between digit ratio, sexual behaviour and aspects of fitness. In contrast to the earlier study, I found no sexual dimorphism in digit ratio and no effect of either laying order or experimentally altered hatching order on digit ratio. Instead, I found that variation in digit ratio was almost entirely additive genetic, with heritability estimates ranging from 71 to 84%. The rearing environment (from egg deposition to independence) explained an additional 5-6% of the variation in digit ratio, but there was no indication of any maternal effects transmitted through the egg. I found highly significant phenotypic correlations (and genetic correlations of similar size) between digit ratio and male song rate (positive correlation) as well as between digit ratio and female hopping activity in a choice chamber (negative correlation). Rather surprisingly, the strength of these correlations differed significantly between subsequent generations of the same population, illustrating how quickly such correlations can appear and disappear probably due to genotype-environment interactions.  2005 The Royal Society."

This has been attributed to higher nutritional requirements of the larger sex, which may render this sex more vulnerable to adverse food conditions. However, sex-biased mortality might not exclusively depend on the differences in food demand but also on other phenotypic differences, e.g., in competitiveness. Interference competition between the sexes and position in the laying sequence in particular may be essential components contributing to biased mortality. By creating synchronously-hatched unisex broods in the sexually size dimorphic black-headed gull, we specifically tested the effect of sex-specific food demand by excluding interference competition between the sexes as well as hatching asynchrony. To test the effect of egg quality, which varies with the position in the laying sequence, we composed each nest of chicks from eggs of all different positions in the laying sequence. All-male nests showed significantly enhanced mortality compared to all-female nests from the beginning of the development of the sexual size dimorphism onwards. This underlines the role of a higher food demand in biased mortality of the larger sex. In males but not females, asymptotic body mass and skeletal size were negatively associated with position in the laying sequence, while survival was not affected by position. As a consequence, sexual size dimorphism at the end of the nestling period was less pronounced compared to the natural situation. These data show that, although male growth is more sensitive to a decrease in egg quality, the higher mortality of last hatched chicks in natural nests is mainly due to hatching asynchrony and egg size but not egg content.

Despite an accumulation of evidence that mothers can sex-specifically modulate investment in offspring in relation to maternal quality, few mechanisms have been proposed as to how this is achieved. We explored a hormonal mechanism for sex-biased maternal investment by measuring and experimentally manipulating baseline levels of the stress hormone corticosterone in laying wild female European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and examining effects on sex ratio and sex-specific offspring phenotype adjustment. Here we show that baseline plasma corticosterone is negatively correlated with energetic body condition in laying starlings, and subsequent experimental elevation of maternal baseline plasma corticosterone increased yolk corticosterone without altering maternal condition or egg quality per se. Hormonal elevation resulted in the following: female-biased hatching sex ratios (caused by elevated male embryonic mortality), lighter male offspring at hatching (which subsequently grew more slowly during postnatal development), and lower cell-mediated immune (phytohemagglutinin) responses in males compared with control-born males; female offspring were unaffected by the manipulation in both years of the study. Elevated maternal corticosterone therefore resulted in a sex-biased adjustment of offspring quality favorable to female offspring via both a sex ratio bias and a modulation of male phenotype at hatching. In birds, deposition of yolk corticosterone may benefit mothers by acting as a bet-hedging strategy in stochastic environments where the correlation between environmental cues at laying (and therefore potentially maternal condition) and conditions during chick-rearing might be low and unpredictable. Together with recent studies in other vertebrate taxa, these results suggest that maternal stress hormones provide a mechanistic link between maternal quality and sex-biased maternal investment in offspring.  2005 by The University of Chicago.

Calls have thus gone out for repeat, multiple-year studies to confirm positive results. In a study of a Wyoming population of house wrens, Troglodytes aedon, Albrecht (2000, Animal Behaviour, 59, 1227) asked whether embryos from last-laid eggs of clutches were predominantly female. Last-laid eggs typically hatch 36-48 h after most other eggs in the clutch. This puts offspring from last eggs at a competitive disadvantage and these offspring are often in poor physical condition at fledging. Albrecht argued that being in poor condition should negatively affect male fitness more than female fitness because males must compete for limited nest sites. Moreover, males that secure multiple sites have the potential to pair polygynously. Albrecht found a strong female bias among offspring from last-laid eggs (27 of 34 individuals) during the 1997 breeding season. We repeated Albrecht's study using the same population over three seasons, 2002-2004. We found no sex bias among offspring from last-laid eggs in any year; overall, 42 of 86 individuals (48.8%) were female. We also found no sex bias among offspring from second-to-last eggs, which also hatch late, or among offspring from the first two eggs. Why our findings differ from those of the original study is unclear.

We argue that the study of behavioural development should combine both proximate and ultimate approaches, and can help to understand how early subtle environmental factors shape consistent individual variation both between and within sexes. This is illustrated by reviewing the profound effects of incubation temperature on the development of brain and social behaviour in the leopard gecko, a species with temperature-dependent sex determination, and the effects of early exposure to steroid hormones on social behaviour in rodents and especially birds. Both are maternal effects: incubation temperature can be partly determined by the nest site where the mother deposited her eggs, while in both oviparous and viviparous vertebrates maternal hormones reach and influence the embryo. In the gecko, incubation temperature affects sexual and aggressive behaviour, growth, the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis, as well as the size, connectivity and metabolic capacity of certain brain areas. In this way not only is the gonad type determined, but so too is the morphological, physiological, neural, and behavioural phenotype established that explains much of within-sex variation. In rodents, maternal hormones affect similar aspects. In avian species, maternal hormones, deposited in the eggs, vary systematically between and within clutches and have both short- and long-lasting effects on competitive behaviour. Evidence suggests that mothers adaptively adjust hormone allocation to the environmental context. In addition, we discuss some effects of postnatal experience on behavioural development in geckos, mice and bird species. Our results also illustrate how the study of animal models other than rodents can help in understanding important developmental processes.  Brill Academic Publishers 2005."

We studied a population of migratory barn swallows over a number of years. Several questions were asked including 1) how do longer lived birds compare to shorter lived individuals of the same species, 2) is there a difference in individuals of the same species that live in different geographical regions, and 3) how do patterns of reproduction change during aging? We compared the phenotypes of 87 individuals from three populations in Denmark, Italy and Spain that had reached at least five years old with those of control individuals matched for sex, arrival date and breeding site. These controls only became one year old, i.e., they were not found thereafter and both groups of individuals were compared in their first year of life. Results showed that there were no significant differences in any of 11 morphological characters or in the abundance of three ectoparasites between the two groups of birds. Females that eventually became very old had relatively smaller first clutches as one year olds than did one year old controls, while males that eventually became very old had mates that laid clutches that were relatively larger than those of controls. Annual fecundity showed a similar pattern, with an increased sex difference in fecundity between birds from Spain than in Italy and in Denmark. Danish barn swallows that achieved older ages had relatively lower haematocrits than control individuals of the same sex, age and arrival date captured at the same site, while the difference in haematocrits between these two categories of individuals was small for Italian birds. Spring arrival date was relatively earlier in Danish males that eventually became very old compared to control males of the same age and tail length (a correlate of fitness) that arrived at the same site, while the two age categories of females did not differ in arrival date.

In vertebrates, a major mechanism of physiological response to stress is mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and results in increased secretion of glucocorticosteroids, which can have adverse consequences on diverse phenotypic traits affecting fitness. Maternal stress may thus have carry-over effects on progeny if it influences pre-natal offspring environment in terms of glucocorticosteroid concentration, although this hypothesis has never been tested in any species under field conditions. We manipulated stress experienced by female barn swallows Hirundo rustica, by exposing them to a predator during laying and measured egg corticosterone concentration. Stressed females laid eggs with greater corticosterone concentration than controls exposed to a herbivore. In another experiment, we injected physiological doses of corticosterone in the egg albumen and compared the phenotype of offspring originating from these eggs with their control siblings originating from either sham-inoculated or unmanipulated eggs and reared in the same nest. Eggs injected with corticosterone had lower hatchability and produced fledglings with smaller body size and slower plumage development than did control eggs. Nestling body size in our study population predicts long-term survival. Thus, maternal stress impaired offspring phenotype and viability by increasing transmission of glucocorticosteroids to the eggs. This study identifies a novel mechanism mediating early maternal effects whereby maternal stress affects offspring quality. These results are relevant to biological conservation because they disclose a mechanism that can link environmental conditions to population productivity and viability.  2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

We tested for facultative maternal investment in the rare sex during and after an experimental perturbation of the ASR by creating populations with female-biased or male-biased ASR. Mothers did not adjust their clutch sex ratio during or after the ASR perturbation, but produced sons with a higher body condition in male-biased populations.

We hypothesized that, for egg-laying vertebrates, high responsiveness of the HPA axis would correspond to high concentrations of corticosterone in yolk. We tested the prediction that Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) selected for high plasma corticosterone response to brief immobilization (HS quail) would lay eggs with higher yolk corticosterone concentrations than birds selected for low response (LS quail). Quail from both lines were left undisturbed, outside of the stressors associated with daily management, before a first round of egg collection. In a second experiment, quail of both lines were experimentally stressed during the week before egg collection. In both cases we found quail from the HS line to lay eggs with significantly higher yolk corticosterone concentrations than quail of the LS line. After exposure to added experimental stressors, the line difference was more pronounced (increasing from 62% to 96%). There was no line difference in concentrations of yolk testosterone. Our results suggest that (1) genetic differences underly differences in the transfer of maternal corticosterone to yolk and (2) females may be able to control deposition of corticosterone into yolk through a mechanism independent of baseline corticosterone titers.  2005 by The University of Chicago.

We examined lipid and protein allocation to yolks, accounting for both relative female age and seasonal effects (first vs. second clutches within a female). Older females appear to increase their investment in reproduction by producing larger eggs, but these eggs are not disproportionately more lipid or protein rich than the smaller eggs from younger females. Within the nesting season, first clutches have more lipid and protein than second clutches. We also found that younger females nest closer to the water than older females.

These offspring often experience competitive disadvantage and delayed development. If hatching asynchrony has a reason other than producing competitive differences among offspring, it would be advantageous, not only for the offspring but even for the parents, to compensate for its detrimental effects. In some species, increasing investment into later laid eggs has been reported and discussed as a compensation mechanism, but its effect on nestling growth and fledging size has not been examined in details. In this study we investigated nestling growth and size at fledging in terms of body mass and length of primaries in relation to the accurate laying and hatching order in collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis broods. We found that females laid larger eggs at the end of the laying sequence, and this helped to decrease the disadvantages for the last offspring. The last offspring had lower body mass growth rate and fledged with shorter feathers, but in both cases the larger the last egg was, the smaller the lag of the offspring was. We conclude, that even if females were not able to fully compensate for the detrimental effects of hatching asynchrony, larger eggs may improve the survival prospects of late hatched nestlings.

We studied the mechanisms behind close association of incubation and sex-determination strategies in this species and discovered that pre-ovulation oocytes that produce males and females differed strongly in the temporal patterns of proliferation and growth. In turn, sex-specific exposure of oocytes to maternal secretion of prolactin and androgens produced distinct accumulation of maternal steroids in oocyte yolks in relation to oocyte proliferation order. These findings suggest that sex difference in oocyte growth and egg-laying sequence is an adaptive outcome of hormonal constraints imposed by the overlap of early incubation and oogenesis in this population, and that the close integration of maternal incubation, oocytes' sex-determination and growth might be under control of the same hormonal mechanism.

This fusion step involves a number of energetically complex steps and requires both protein and lipid membrane components. The role of cholesterol has been investigated using isolated release-ready native cortical secretory vesicles to analyze the Ca2+-triggered fusion step of exocytosis. Cholesterol is a major component of vesicle membranes and we show here that selective removal from membranes, selective sequestering within membranes, or enzymatic modification causes a significant inhibition of the extent, Ca2+ sensitivity and kinetics of fusion. Depending upon the amount incorporated, addition of exogenous cholesterol to cholesterol-depleted membranes consistently recovers the extent, but not the Ca2+ sensitivity or kinetics of fusion. Membrane components of comparable negative curvature selectively recover the ability to fuse, but are unable to recover the kinetics and Ca 2+ sensitivity of vesicle fusion. This indicates at least two specific positive roles for cholesterol in the process of membrane fusion: as a local membrane organizer contributing to the efficiency of fusion, and, by virtue of its intrinsic negative curvature, as a specific molecule working in concert with protein factors to facilitate the minimal molecular machinery for fast Ca2+-triggered fusion."

Each peacock was paired with three peahens that differed with respect to their relative body condition, creating a condition and dominance hierarchy within each pen and thus a situation in which we would predict investment in offspring to vary between hens. We found significant intercorrelations between maternal body condition (but not dominance rank or clutch size), maternal plasma levels of corticosterone and testosterone (but not 17-oestradiol) and clutch sex ratio, such that good maternal condition, low plasma corticosterone and high levels of testosterone were associated with male biases in the sex ratio and increased investment in male eggs. The observed biases were probably present at laying, and thus add to the growing number of studies showing primary sex ratio adjustment in response to maternal body condition, and furthermore may indicate a role for corticosterone and testosterone in the avian sex manipulation process.  2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

A review of the literature revealed that intense directional selection for high levels of circulating testosterone in birds is likely to be mainly due to direct selection on males. A comparative study of testosterone levels in birds revealed a strong positive relationship between peak testosterone levels in adult females and peak levels in males. The slope of this relationship was significantly less than unity, implying that the testosterone levels in females have been reduced in species with high levels in males. An analysis of the order of evolutionary events suggested that peak concentration of testosterone in females changed after peak concentrations of testosterone in males. Females in colonial species of birds had significantly higher circulating peak testosterone levels compared to females of solitary species, and relative levels after controlling for the effects of peak levels in males were also larger, suggesting that any costs of high testosterone levels in females are particularly likely in colonial birds. Direct selection on male circulating testosterone levels may increase the costs that females incur from high testosterone titers. For example, high female levels may negatively affect ovulation and laying and may also affect the levels of testosterone that females deposit in their eggs and hence the exposure of pre- and post-hatching offspring to testosterone. This in turn may affect not only offspring behavior, but also offspring development and the trade-offs between growth, development of immune function, and behavior in offspring.

As androgens may suppress immune functions, they may also entail costs for the chick. This is particularly relevant for colonial species, such as the black-headed gull (Larus ridibundus), in which the aggregation of large numbers of birds during the breeding season enhances the risk of infectious diseases for the hatching chick. To test the effect of maternal yolk androgens on the chick's immune function, we experimentally manipulated, in a field study, yolk androgen levels within the physiological range by in ovo injection of either androgens (testosterone and androstenedione) or sesame oil (control) into freshly laid eggs. We determined cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and humoral immunity of the chicks at the beginning of the nestling period to evaluate early modulatory effects of yolk androgens on immune function. Embryonic exposure to elevated levels of androgens negatively affected both CMI and humoral immunity in nestling gull chicks. Consequently, maternal yolk androgens not only entail benefits of enhanced competitiveness and growth as previously shown, but also costs in terms of immunosuppression. The outcome of embryonic yolk androgen exposure thus likely depends on the post-hatching circumstances for the developing offspring such as parasite exposure and degree of sibling competition.  2005 The Royal Society."

Individual animals vary in the way they cope with challenges in their environment, comparable with variation in human personalities. This variation has a substantial genetic basis. Here we describe experiments showing the strength of environmental factors (food availability and sibling competition) in shaping personality traits in a passerine bird (Parus major). We manipulated the early rearing condition in two lines (F4) bidirectionally selected for different personalities (fast line: high exploration speed and high aggression; slow line: low exploration speed and low aggression) with a food rationing protocol inducing an impairment in growth rate and an enhancement in levels of offspring solicitation (begging behaviour). Growth impairment was more marked in the slow line. In a first experiment each nest contained experimental and control siblings of the same line (within-nests design). Slow chicks became much faster than their parents in the exploration tests regardless of the treatment, whereas fast chicks had scores similar to their parents and showed no treatment effect. As a consequence, the line difference in exploration behaviour of the offspring was not apparent in the juvenile phase. Six months later the offspring of the slow line was still relatively fast, but lines differed in exploration, since the fast line became even more fast. Food-rationed birds of the fast line were more aggressive than both controls and their fathers, while treatment did not affect the slow line. In a second experiment, carried out only in the slow line, each nest contained either control or experimental siblings (between-nests design). Now, only the food-rationed chicks became faster in exploration. We suggest that the shift in the controls in the within-nests design was due to enhanced sibling competition, forced by the experimental chick. Indeed, the control chicks in the first experiment begged more persistently and had higher exploration scores than the control chicks in the between-nests design. Environmental factors during ontogeny modulate the expression of phenotypic traits against the background of the reaction norm allowed by the genome even in selected lines of animals resulting in profound and reliable differences in behaviour.

The ascidian is known to exhibit a mosaic mode of development, and this mode is largely dependent on localized maternal factors. Using blastomere isolation, microarray and whole-mount in situ hybridization, the present study of Ciona intestinalis demonstrates that maternal transcripts of a total of 17 genes are localized at the posterior-most region of fertilized eggs and early embryos. Ten of them are newly identified in the present study, while the remaining seven genes have already been characterized in previous studies. In addition, maternal transcripts of two genes, in addition to 14 genes encoded by the mitochondrial genome, showed a mitochondria-like distribution. Despite the present comprehensive approach, we could not identify maternal transcripts that are clearly localized to the animal-pole side, the vegetal-pole side, the anterior-side or other specific regions of the early embryo.

However, to date the potential mechanisms that have been put forward to explain the proximate basis for these deviations are entirely speculative. Using a captive population of domestic pigeons (Columba livia domestica), I tested the hypothesis that mothers in relatively poor physical condition should overproduce daughters by manipulating maternal body condition around the time of egg laying by continuous egg removal and differing feeding regimes. During treatment, females were fed a controlled quantity of food. This, combined with the high energetic costs of repeated egg production caused a significant reduction in maternal body weight. In contrast, during control when food was available ad libitum, maternal body weight did not decline, despite repeated egg production. No significant deviation from parity was evident in the sex ratio of either the first or second eggs during control, whereas during treatment a significant female bias was evident in not only the first egg, but also in the second egg. The absence of single-egg clutches, the rarity of infertile eggs and the lack of laying delays between eggs strongly suggests that the mechanism of sex ratio adjustment in pigeons occurs prior to ovulation. The highly skewed sex-distribution within the two-egg clutches and the unexpectedly large amount of variation in the yolk weight of eggs produced during treatment (but not control) are consistent with the expectations of pre-ovulatory selective resorption of 'wrong' sex ovarian follicles.

We first compared sons of monogynous and polygynous free-living males for their abilities in nest site acquisition and female-directed behaviors in controlled aviary tests. We then investigated eggs laid in monogynous and polygynous matings for concentrations of maternal steroid hormones that could affect behavioral differentiation of sons. Sons of polygynous fathers defended more nest boxes and produced more courtship song than sons of monogynous fathers. Mean concentrations of maternal androstenedione (A4), 5-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), testosterone (T), and 17-estradiol (E) in yolks were not affected by mating status. However, the within-clutch pattern of A4 depended on mating status, with higher concentrations in last than in first eggs of clutches of monogynous but not polygynous matings. These results suggest that (1) sons may inherit from their fathers behavioral qualities for the successful acquisition of nest sites and attraction of mates; (2) differential exposure to maternal steroid hormones during development in the egg is unlikely the cause of the behavioral differences between adult sons of monogynous and polygynous fathers; and (3) females adjust the within-clutch pattern of androgen to mating status, possibly in response to the expected contribution of their mate to nestling care.

Maternal yolk hormones can enhance the development and phenotypic quality of nestling birds. Nevertheless, within species large differences in yolk androgen concentrations among clutches are observed. This differential allocation of maternal yolk hormones might be explained by a trade-off between beneficial effects of yolk androgens and their associated costs. 2. Potential costs include an increased susceptibility to parasites in nestlings exposed to high concentrations of yolk androgens during embryonic development, weaker immune response or increased levels of circulating corticosterone that indirectly reduce immune function. 3. In a field study, we manipulated yolk testosterone in great tit (Parus major) eggs and tested the nestling's susceptibility to ectoparasites as measured by the parasites' effect on growth, the cellular immune response, and the levels of circulating corticosterone. 4. At the end of the nestling period, nestlings originating from testosterone-injected eggs were heavier than control nestlings. This effect was strongest in nestlings at the end of the size hierarchy, as shown by a significant interaction between hormone treatment and the nestlings' size rank within nests. 5. High levels of yolk testosterone promoted growth of the nestling's body mass similarly in parasite-infested and parasite-free nests, and neither affected the levels of plasma corticosterone, nor the nestling's cell-mediated immune response. 6. In summary, our results do not show negative short-term effects of high concentrations of yolk testosterone on immune function or parasite susceptibility, but emphasize that maternal investment via deposition of yolk testosterone can promote fitness-related growth and development of nestlings.  2005 British Ecological Society."

During early development male offspring in avian species often suffer from enhanced mortality compared to female offspring. This has been attributed to different nutritional requirements, as sex-biased mortality has been reported particularly in sexually size-dimorphic species. However, other traits of the male phenotype, such as the embryonic hormone profile, have been suggested to contribute to this male disadvantage. In particular the negative effects of sex steroids on immune function may be causally involved. 2. We investigated the role of testosterone in the expression of male phenotype disadvantage through an experimental reduction of the availability of testosterone receptors by in-ovo injection of an anti-androgen (Flutamide). Experimental nests contained a male and a female chick hatching from control treated eggs and a male and a female chick hatching from Flutamide treated eggs. 3. Male-biased mortality occurred in control chicks at a stage where the sexes did not yet differ in their growth pattern, suggesting that sex-specific nutritional requirements are not necessary for male-biased mortality to occur. Control males and control females did not differ in their cell-mediated immunity (CMI). This renders it unlikely that the observed skewed mortality was due to sex-specific differences in the CMI. 4. Treatment of the eggs with flutamide antagonistically affected males and females. Flutamide treatment positively affected male development in particular through an enhanced growth rate, indicating that testosterone is involved in the expression of the male phenotype disadvantage. Female chicks hatching from Flutamide treated eggs were disadvantaged in growth and CMI. The possible pathways of this sex-specific effect of Flutamide are discussed with regard to differential consequences of blocking the beneficial effects of maternal androgens and the interference with the process of sexual differentiation in males.  2005 British Ecological Society."

Previous studies on zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, in which colored leg rings were used to alter male attractiveness, support this hypothesis. However, because molecular sexing techniques were not available, it was not known when during development this bias arose. Also, because both attractive (red-ringed) and unattractive (green-ringed) males were within the same aviary, assortative mating between treatments may have confounded the results. Using two different experimental designs, we tested whether the sex ratio of zebra finch eggs and chicks differed in response to paternal ring color whilst controlling for assortative mating between treatments. In the aviary experiment, birds could interact socially, but all males in an aviary had the same leg ring color. In the cage experiment, each female was randomly assigned a red- or green-ringed mate, thus also eliminating assortative mating within treatments. Offspring were sexed based on plumage or using a molecular method. The sex ratio at laying did not differ between treatments in either the aviary (n = 313 eggs) or cage (n = 151 eggs) experiments, suggesting that female zebra finches do not manipulate the primary sex ratio in response to their mate's ring color. However, in the cage experiment we found greater male embryonic mortality in the attractive group, which resulted in a female-biased sex ratio at sexual maturity, that is, in the opposite direction to that found in previous studies.

To examine the effects of yolk T on nestling eastern bluebirds, we administered two doses of exogenous T to bluebird eggs and measured the growth and immunological responsiveness in the resulting nestlings. We found that yolk T is detrimental to developing embryos, with hatching success decreasing with increasing doses of yolk T. Moderate doses of yolk T stimulated skeletal growth during the embryonic period, while high doses of yolk T resulted in nestlings that weighed more and were more mature at fledging but had a compromised T-cell immune response to phytohemagglutinin.

Using a captive population of peafowl (Pavo cristatus), we tested experimentally the effects of paternal attractiveness on offspring sex ratio, and related sex ratio deviations to egg-yolk concentrations of testosterone, 17-estradiol and corticosterone. When females were mated to males whose attractiveness had been experimentally reduced by removing prominent eyespot feathers from their trains, they produced significantly more female offspring, had significantly higher yolk corticosterone concentrations and tended to have lower levels of yolk testosterone than when mated to the same males with their full complement of feathers. Concentrations of 17-estradiol did not vary consistently with sex ratio biases. These findings add to the small number of studies providing experimental evidence that female birds can control the primary sex ratio of their offspring in response to paternal attractiveness, and highlight the possibility that corticosterone and perhaps testosterone are involved in the sex manipulation process in birds.  2005 The Royal Society."

In addition, parents may need to sex bias their investment if there is an asymmetry between the sexes in offspring fitness under different conditions. For studying maternal differential investment, egg resources are ideal subjects because they are self contained and allocated unequivocally by the female. Recent studies show that yolk androgens can be beneficial to offspring, so here we test for sex-biased investment with maternal investment of yolk testosterone (T) in zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) eggs. From the Trivers-Willard hypothesis, we predicted females to invest more in male eggs in optimum circumstances (e.g. good-condition mother, early-laid egg), and more in female eggs under suboptimal conditions (e.g. poor-condition mother, late-laid egg). This latter prediction is also because in this species there is a female nestling disadvantage in poor conditions and we expected mothers to help compensate for this in female eggs. Indeed, we found more yolk T in female than male eggs. Moreover, in accordance with our predictions, yolk T in male eggs increased with maternal quality relative to female eggs, and decreased with laying order relative to female eggs. This supports our predictions for the different needs and value of male and female offspring in zebra finches. Our results support the idea that females may use yolk androgens as a tool to adaptively manipulate the inequalities between different nestlings.  Springer-Verlag 2005."

Investigating the traits females use in their allocation decisions and the aspects of reproduction that are altered is essential for understanding how sexual selection is affected. We studied the potential for differential female allocation in a captive population of a precocial bird, the Chinese quail, Coturnix chinensis. Females paired with males with large sexual ornaments laid larger, but not more, eggs than females paired with males with small sexual ornaments. Furthermore, female egg mass was also significantly positively affected by male testis size, probably via some unknown effect of testis size on male phenotype. Testis size and ornament size were not correlated. Thus, both primary and secondary male sexual traits could be important components of female allocation decisions. Experimental manipulation of hormone levels during embryonic development showed that both male and female traits influencing female egg size were sensitive to early hormone exposure. Differences in prenatal hormone exposure as a result of maternal steroid allocation to eggs may explain some of the variation in reproductive success among individuals, with important implications for non-genetic transgenerational effects in sexual selection.

In oviparous animals this can include prefertilization decisions such as the production of larger eggs and the deposition of hormones, such as the steroid testosterone, into yolks. On the other hand, a compensatory hypothesis posits that females allocate more resources into the eggs when mated with males of inferior quality. In the present study, we show that free-living females of the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis), a small passerine bird, do not produce larger eggs or deposit more testosterone into eggs when mating with attractive males reflected by a large forehead patch size, which is contrary to the prediction of the differential allocation hypothesis. However, we found higher yolk testosterone concentrations in eggs laid for young than older males. Because in young males genetic quality, parental experience, or willingness to invest into paternal care is likely to be low, high yolk testosterone level in their clutches may indicate that their females follow a compensatory tactic. They may elicit more paternal care from young, inexperienced males by hormonally increasing nestling begging.

The presence of maternal testosterone and carotenoids in avian egg yolk, for example, is thought to enhance the development and competitive ability of the offspring and protect the hatching and growing chick against oxidative stress. Egg quality often differs between females and such variation can be due to differences in maternal social environment, e.g. breeding density. However, this is confounded by the possibility that the quality of individuals breeding in high- or low-density areas may vary. We tested if maternal social environment influences egg composition in a colonial seabird, the lesser black-backed gull (Larus fuscus). To control for confounding effects of female quality, we experimentally manipulated maternal social environment during egg formation. We increased the frequency of intra-specific interactions (i.e. aggressive encounters with conspecifics other than nest mates) in which the females were involved, by placing an elevated platform in their territory. Females that took part in more intra-specific interactions produced a heavier last egg, but the yolk testosterone concentration in eggs laid by control and experimental females did not differ. Differences in yolk testosterone concentration in relation to embryo sex were found neither in the control nor in the experimental group. In contrast, within the control group, eggs with a male embryo contained more carotenoids than eggs with a female embryo. Moreover, experimental females that had been involved in more intra-specific interactions produced female eggs with higher carotenoid levels compared to female eggs of control birds. An experimental increase in carotenoid levels was not observed in eggs containing a male embryo.

The chicks hatching from these as well as from control eggs that had received the carrier-only or were left unmanipulated were subject to a number of behavioral tests from hatching to the age of 3 weeks. In addition, fecal samples were taken during a 90-min isolation period to determine a physiological response to a stressor. Experimental chicks performed a detour task faster and approached novel objects sooner than did the controls. Chicks from treated eggs took a longer time to start distress vocalizing and also produced less distress calls during open-field trials, took on average a larger number of trials for them to show tonic immobility and also excreted lower levels of corticosterone metabolites (BM) than did the controls. In response to a stressor, excreted BM was initially higher in the control chicks, as compared to the experimental birds. Induced behavioral effects were independent of sex with no sex treatment interactions found. In sum, experimentally enhanced testosterone levels in the eggs shifted individual behavioral phenotype towards ""bold"" or ""proactive"", irrespective of sex.

In sham-manipulated females, yolk E2 concentrations decreased with laying sequence.

Geographical comparisons of yolk testosterone levels in all cowbird subspecies and populations from several regions showed no significant differences, though a trend that deserves further exploration was the pattern of lowest level in the ancestral population of cowbirds in the central prairies and of highest level in the northwestern population where range invasion occurred approximately 40 years ago. The levels of 17 beta-estradiol were similar in the seven songbird species examined, which is consistent with current hypotheses that this hormone plays a role in embryonic sexual differentiation.

Changes in yolk hormone levels during the incubation period and the uneven distribution of hormones within the egg are discussed. Different ways of calculating hormone levels and the importance of collecting data for specific a priori hypotheses are explained. Next to be discussed are the pros and cons of different techniques for manipulating yolk hormone levels and their proper scaling to naturally occurring levels. Third, several issues hampering the interpretation of results from descriptive and experimental studies are addressed. These concern biased embryonic mortality, clutch size, and egg quality that may confound the interpretation of the effect of egg position in the laying order, and the possibility of sex-specific effects and long-term effects.

We also investigated whether this pattern differed between male and female eggs. Females laid eggs on a high-quality (HQ) or a low-quality (LQ) diet. Eggs were removed at laying and artificially incubated for 72 h, after which time embryos were sexed and yolk androgens assayed. Diet treatments were then swapped and the experiment repeated. Because there was evidence of a carry-over effect between breeding rounds, we based our conclusions mainly on the results from the first breeding round. On the HQ diet, but not on the LQ diet, infertile eggs contained more testosterone than did fertile eggs in round one. Although there were no overall differences in within-clutch patterns of androgen deposition between the diets, this changed when embryo sex was taken into account. On the HQ diet, testosterone decreased with laying sequence for male eggs but increased with laying sequence for female eggs. On the LQ diet, mothers' male eggs contained more testosterone and DHT than did female eggs regardless of position in the laying sequence.

In addition, mothers with experimentally elevated corticosterone levels lay eggs with larger concentrations of the hormone, which produce slow growing offspring with high activity of the hypothalamo-adrenal axis under acute stress. However, the effects and function of transfer of maternal corticosterone to the eggs are largely unknown. In the present study, we injected corticosterone in freshly laid eggs of yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis), thus increasing the concentration of the hormone within its natural range of variation, and analyzed the effect of manipulation on behavioral, morphological, and immune traits of the offspring in the wild. Eggs injected with corticosterone had similar hatching success to controls, but hatched later. Mass loss during incubation was greater for corticosterone-treated eggs, except for the last laid ones. Corticosterone injection reduced rate and loudness of late embryonic vocalizations and the intensity of chick begging display. Tonic immobility response, reflecting innate fearfulness, was unaffected by hormone treatment. Elevated egg corticosterone concentrations depressed T-cell-mediated immunity but had no detectable effects on humoral immune response to a novel antigen, viability at day 10, or growth.

This paper describes the sampling, extraction, and assay of hormones in avian eggs and related methodological problems. The method of sampling is important because hormones are not homogeneously distributed within the egg, and after onset of embryonic development their levels may decrease and increase due to changes in egg structure and secretion or uptake of hormones by the embryo. The extraction of hormones from the yolk and chromatographic separation of different hormones for immunoassays can strongly influence the results because such procedures remove interfering substances such as proteins, lipids, and other hormones and their metabolites, which can cross-react with the antiserum used. Finally, the assay itself needs more validation than many studies report, especially with respect to the accuracy and specificity of the hormone measurements.

Results show that administration of T negatively affected clutch size; the strength of this effect increased with increasing doses of T. Females injected with the highest testosterone dose showed suppressed oviposition of the third and the fourth eggs.

Methods: Oocytes matured in vivo or in different culture media were used and CG distribution and release were assessed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled Lens culinaris agglutinin and laser confocal microscopy. Results: Tempos of nuclear maturation and CG redistribution were slower, and competence for CG exocytosis, cleavage and blastulation were lower in the IVM oocytes than in the IVO oocytes. These parameters also differed among oocytes matured in different culture media. Hypoxanthine (HX, 4 mM) blocked germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), postponed CG migration and prevented CG-free domain (CGFD) formation. Cycloheximide (CHX) facilitated both GVBD and CG migration, but inhibited CGFD formation. The presence of serum in maturation media enhanced CG release after aging or activation of oocytes. Maintenance of germinal vesicle intact for some time by a trace amount (0.18 mM) of HX was beneficial to oocyte cytoplasmic maturation. Conclusion: CGs behaved differently in mouse oocytes matured under different conditions, and cytoplasmic maturity was not fully achieved in the IVM oocytes.  The Author 2005.

Alarm calls could stimulate increased secretion of corticosterone to mobilize energy reserves in anticipation of an interaction with a predator. However, elevated corticosterone levels can be costly to nestlings because they induce catabolic reactions at a time when the birds are engaged in anabolic processes. Thus, there may be constraints on the secretion of corticosterone if the catabolic costs outweigh the behavioral benefits. Furthermore, many studies use baseline corticosterone levels as a correlate of body condition, and if nestlings respond hormonally when they hear alarm calls rather than when they are first handled by (or catch sight of) an investigator, then determination of baseline hormone levels would be difficult. To investigate this phenomenon, we broadcast taped calls of either adult conspecific alarm calls or songs of heterospecifics to 15-20 d old American Kestrel (Falco sparverius) nestlings. Playbacks were started when adults were absent, but adults returned and produced alarm calls at two control and three experimental nests. Blood was collected from randomly selected nestlings at each nest 13 min after the onset of a playback and within 2 min of opening the nest box, and the plasma was assayed for corticosterone. There was no difference in corticosterone values between nestlings that heard alarm calls and those that heard control vocalizations. Hearing natural kestrel alarm calls did not affect the results, although our small sample sizes resulted in low power to detect differences. These data indicate that 15-20 d old kestrels do not increase corticosterone secretion in response to adult conspecific alarm calls, and suggest that studies of corticosterone secretion in nestling kestrels will not be affected by the occurrence of adult alarm-calling."

Two commonly examined factors potentially influencing offspring sex ratio are paternal ornamentation and maternal condition. Male junglefowl with larger combs are attractive to females. I housed female Red Junglefowl (Gallus gallus) with sterile male consorts and artificially inseminated them with sperm from other males that the females never saw. I found no relationship between either the comb size of the consort or the comb size of the sperm donor and the sex ratio of the offspring. I previously reported a significant sex ratio bias related to maternal mass in Red Junglefowl. However, that analysis was based on sex ratio data not weighted for brood size and assuming a normal distribution. Here, I show that this effect disappears when I conduct a more appropriate analysis weighting sex ratio according to brood size and accounting for the binomial error distribution. I also failed to find evidence that male chicks hatch from larger eggs than female chicks. These results suggest that Red Junglefowl females may not bias the sex ratio of their brood in response to either their own condition or the attractiveness of the males with whom they copulate.

Although organizational effects of steroids have been demonstrated, the interactions between steroids from yolk and endogenous production have not been addressed. Steroids in the yolk are likely to alter development of the embryo's endocrine axes. The ability to assess total steroid exposure in ovo in a nonlethal fashion would improve our understanding of these interactions and help elucidate the mechanisms by which maternal steroids alter chick phenotype. Steroid levels in allantoic waste provide a cumulative measure of steroids excreted in ovo and may prove to be a useful tool.

Intracellular morphogens spread within the egg cytoplasm from mRNA sources that are tightly localized to the anterior or posterior egg cortex. Extracellular morphogens spread within the extraembryonic space (perivitelline space) surrounding the embryo and depend on localized cues within the eggshell or extracellular matrix. bicoid, an intracellular morphogen, is required to specify the head and thorax of the embryo. Sptzle, an extracellular morphogen, activates the Toll receptor at the surface of the embryo, ultimately leading to a concentration gradient of the Dorsal protein, which is required to establish the dorsoventral axis of the embryo. The following experiments explore the morphogen concept by showing how changes in concentrations of the transcription factors Bicoid and Dorsal affect the cell fates of the early embryo. Alterations of cell fates in mutant as compared to wild-type embryos will be monitored by looking at gastrulation and cuticle patterns. The observed shifts in cell fates will be correlated to the expression of zygotic genes which are targets of concentration-dependent activation and/or repression by Bicoid or Dorsal. Together, these experiments should provide an understanding of how each gradient specifies a polar sequence of stripe-like expression domains, which in turn determine the pattern of cell fates along the two major body axes.

Male response scores to a STI and male T concentrations varied with phase, but there was no temporal association between plasma T levels and the intensity of territorial behavior. During both two sexual and two parental phases, at least half of the tested males showed aggressive responses. About 20% of the tested males responded with courtship prior to laying of the first clutch, but none of the males courted during later phases. Age had a positive overall effect on male plasma T. Females also reacted to the STI of a male, but their responses did not vary with breeding phase. Female plasma T varied with phase, being elevated during production of the first but not of the second clutch. As with males, female responses to the STI were not correlated with T levels. Responses of pair partners were positively correlated with each other. We conclude that modulation of male territorial aggression with breeding phase is not regulated by changes of plasma T concentrations. In light of other studies showing reduced male aggression by pharmacological inhibition of cellular actions of T, we propose that T is permissive for male territorial aggression, but does not mediate short-term changes associated with breeding phase. The function of the high female plasma T concentrations during formation of first clutches could be related to the production of eggs with high concentrations of androgens.  2004 Published by Elsevier Inc."

Lines bidirectionally selected for exploration show a wide array of social and non-social behavioral differences, and also some differences in physiological parameters. Line differences in these characteristics and their relationships show significant temporal consistency. The results show a surprising similarity between the great tit and a rodent model, suggesting a fundamental principle in the organization of behavioral profiles. The nature of this principle and whether or not it is multi-dimensional is discussed. However, the similarity with a chicken model is less clear, which points to some caution for generalization. The epigenesis of great tit behavioral profiles is discussed. Selection experiments with replication and backcrosses reveal a strong genetic basis, and suggest an influence of maternal effects. Ontogenetic manipulations indicate strong developmental plasticity, suggesting adaptive adjustment to prevailing environmental circumstances. They also show that behavioral characteristics belonging to the same profile can become uncoupled. Finally, field data on several fitness parameters of the different personalities in wild great tits are summarized. These data suggest that variation in selection pressure in time and space and assortative mating are plausible mechanisms accounting for the maintenance of different behavioral profiles within the same population.  2004 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that in non-human mammals the stability of the social environment in which the pregnant females live is critical for the offsprings' social and sexual behaviour later in life as well as for reproductive functioning, endocrine state and androgen and estrogen receptor distribution in specific parts of the brain. Based on these findings, we discuss different neuroendocrine mechanisms mediating the influence of the social environment during pregnancy on the offsprings' behaviour. We conclude that maternal steroids play a decisive role in shaping foetal brain development. However, a pituitary adrenocortical pathway need not always be involved. At least in some cases an involvement of the sympathetic adrenomedullary system seems to be possible. Concerning function, we favour the hypothesis that the behavioural effects of prenatal social stress are not necessarily the 'pathological' consequences of adverse social conditions (non-adaptive explanation).

This question has puzzled and marveled evolutionary and behavioral ecologists for decades. In mating systems in which males provide direct benefits to the female or her offspring, such as food or shelter, the answer seems straightforward - females should prefer to mate with males that are able to provide more resources. The answer is less clear in other mating systems in which males provide no resources (other than sperm) to females. Theoretical models that account for the evolution of mate choice in such nonresource-based mating systems require that females obtain a genetic benefit through increased offspring fitness from their choice. Empirical studies of nonresource-based mating systems that are characterized by strong female choice for males with elaborate sexual traits (like the large tail of peacocks) suggest that additive genetic benefits can explain only a small percentage of the variation in fitness. Other research on genetic benefits has examined nonadditive effects as another source of genetic variation in fitness and a potential benefit to female mate choice. In this paper, we review the sexual selection literature on genetic quality to address five objectives. First, we attempt to provide an integrated framework for discussing genetic quality. We propose that the term 'good gene' be used exclusively to refer to additive genetic variation in fitness, 'compatible gene' be used to refer to nonadditive genetic variation in fitness, and 'genetic quality' be defined as the sum of the two effects. Second, we review empirical approaches used to calculate the effect size of genetic quality and discuss these approaches in the context of measuring benefits from good genes, compatible genes and both types of genes. Third, we discuss biological mechanisms for acquiring and promoting offspring genetic quality and categorize these into three stages during breeding: (i) precopulatory (mate choice); (ii) postcopulatory, prefertilization (sperm utilization); and (iii) postcopulatory, postfertilization (differential investment). Fourth, we present a verbal model of the effect of good genes sexual selection and compatible genes sexual selection on population genetic variation in fitness, and discuss the potential trade-offs that might exist between mate choice for good genes and mate choice for compatible genes. Fifth, we discuss some future directions for research on genetic quality and sexual selection."

Accumulating data from animal models indicate that prenatal and early-postnatal events (collectively called ""early-life events"") can initiate long-term changes in the expression of the genetic program which persist, or may only become apparent, much later in the individual's life. Researchers working with humans or animal models of human diseases often view the effects of early-life events through the lens of pathology, with a focus on whether the events increase the risk for a particular disease. Alternatively, comparative biologists often view the effects of early-life events through the lens of evolution and adaptation by natural selection; they investigate the processes by which environmental conditions present early in life may prompt the adoption of different developmental pathways leading to alternative life histories. Examples of both approaches are presented in this article. This article reviews the concepts of phenotypic plasticity, natural selection, and evidence from animal models that early-life events can program the activity of the neuroendocrine system, at times altering life history patterns in an adaptive manner. Data from seasonally breeding rodents are used to illustrate the use of maternally derived information to alter the life history of young. In several species, the maternal system transfers photoperiodic information to the young in utero. This maternally derived information alters the response of young to photoperiods encountered later and life, producing seasonally distinct life histories.  2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Since the cloning of the intracellular steroid receptors/transcription factors, it has been assumed that most if not all of the actions of the gonadal steroids are mediated via these intracellular receptors. However, there now exist compelling evidence for membrane (G-protein-coupled) steroid receptors for estrogen and progesterone in hypothalamic and other brain neurons. But, it is not well understood how steroids signal via membrane receptors, and how these signals impact not only membrane excitability but also gene transcription in hypothalamic neurons. Indeed, it has been known for sometime that gonadal steroids can rapidly alter hypothalamic neuronal activity within seconds, indicating that some cellular effects can occur via membrane delimited events. In addition, gonadal steroids can affect second messenger systems, including calcium and various kinases to prompt and/or alter cell signaling. Therefore, this chapter will consider our current knowledge of rapid (i.e., seconds to minutes) membrane-initiated and intracellular signaling as well as classical nuclear receptor signaling by gonadal steroids in hypothalamic neurons, the nature of these receptors and how they contribute to homeostatic functions.  2005 Elsevier Inc.

In birds, the duration of growth of a single egg exceeds the ovulation interval, and when maternal resources are limited, a temporal overlap among several developing follicles in the ovary might result in a trade-off of resources among them. We studied growth of oocytes in relation to their future ovulation order, sex, and overlap with other oocytes in a population of house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) where strongly sex-biased maternal effects are favoured by natural selection. We found pronounced differences in growth patterns between oocytes that produced males and females. Male oocytes grew up to five times faster and reached their ovulation size earlier than female oocytes. Early onset and early termination of male oocytes' growth in relation to their ovulation resulted in their lesser temporal overlap with other growing ova compared with female oocytes. Consequently, ovulation mass of female but not male oocytes was strongly negatively affected by temporal overlap with other oocytes. In turn, mass of male oocytes was mostly affected by the order of ovulation and by maternal incubation strategy. These results provide a mechanism for sex-biased allocation of maternal resources during egg formation and provide insights into the timing of the sex-determining meiotic division in relation to ovulation in this species."

The good parent model assumes that expression of the sexual character positively reflects parental ability, resulting in a potential link between the exaggeration of the character and nestling-fitness traits. We tested this prediction in a population of a monogamous passerine, the magpie (Pica pica), for which nest size is known to act as a post-mating sexually selected signal. We provided a food supplement to half of the magpie nestlings in each nest, keeping the other half as control nestlings. We found that food-supplemented nestlings experienced a significantly higher T-cell-mediated immune response and a tendency to an increased condition index. In accordance with the good parent model, we found that nest size was positively related to T-cell mediated immune response for control magpie, whereas this relationship was nonexistent in food-supplemented nestlings. In addition, the difference in T-cell mediated immune response between food-supplemented and control nestlings of the same nest was principally explained by nest size. Based on our results, we discuss that magpie pairs with large nests provided their nestlings with higher quality food as compared to pairs with smaller nests, nest size thereby being an indicator of parental ability. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing a link between a post-mating sexually selected signal and nestling immunocompetence, a trait closely related to fitness in birds."

Later-hatching chicks have a competitive disadvantage, and brood reduction may occur when food availability is insufficient to raise all chicks. When early-hatched chicks fail to survive or if the circumstances allow raising all chicks, mothers should reverse the disadvantage to later-hatched chicks. Increasing deposition of maternal androgens with the laying sequence has been suggested to compensate for detrimental effects of hatching asynchrony, allowing a more precise adjustment of the survival probabilities of each chick. Here, we show for black-headed gulls that the increase in yolk testosterone with each successive egg is greater when the mother incubates longer before clutch completion, which is the major determinant of the degree of hatching asynchrony. This finding supports the idea that yolk testosterone has a compensatory function in the context of hatching asynchrony. Our data further show that if the time needed to complete a clutch is lengthened, the developmental differences due to incubation between the first- and the last-laid eggs increase. In addition, the onset of incubation before clutch completion occurs sooner as the breeding season progresses. Both long inter-egg intervals and the seasonal shift in incubation behavior enhance the necessity of compensation for later-hatching chicks. Indeed, yolk levels of testosterone increased more steeply over the laying order, if the duration of the egg-laying period was extended and in later-laid clutches. We suggest that prolactin plays a key role in the adjustment of testosterone allocation to the incubation pattern."

Females are also predicted to invest more in sons than in daughters under such conditions, because male offspring should have higher fitness returns than female offspring when fathered by an attractive male. We examined primary resource allocation in zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, when mated to both an attractive and an unattractive male. In the first breeding round, as predicted, females mated to attractive males laid heavier eggs, and there was a positive relation between female mass and egg mass. In contrast, for females mated to unattractive males there was no correlation between egg mass and body mass. Mate attractiveness did not affect clutch size or yolk androgen investment. Unexpectedly, in the second breeding round, in which the same females were paired with different males of opposite attractiveness to those in the first round, females did not alter their individual patterns of investment in egg mass. Therefore, we suggest there may be a physiological carryover effect and that females were primed by their first reproductive experience. In both rounds of breeding there was no difference in egg mass or yolk androgen concentration between male or female eggs in either treatment. Similarly, the primary sex ratio did not differ between treatments.

Second-year mothers in NP pairings laid significantly heavier eggs than second-years mothers in preferred (P) pairings; mean egg mass of first-year mothers with NP or P mates did not differ. However, mean egg mass per mother and mean number of eggs per mother were positively and significantly related.

By fledging age, duckling performance, quality and condition were significantly lower for first-year mothers with NP mates compared with those for mothers in the other categories.

We use a comparative approach to evaluate which ecological or life-history variables may have favored the evolution of conspicuous ornamentation in precocial chicks. We compiled data on chick morphology, ecology, and social organization of species in the Family Rallidae, a group with highly variable downy chicks. Chick ornamentation in the form of brightly colored bills, fleshy patches, or plumes is observed in 36 of 97 species for which downy chicks are described. Phylogenetic reconstructions suggest that nonornamentation is the ancestral state. Chick ornamentation has evolved multiple times within the Rallidae and is significantly associated with large clutch sizes and polygamous mating systems. Chick ornamentation was also weakly associated with adult ornamentation and adult dimorphism. We argue that these results support the hypothesis that lineages with higher levels of sibling competition are more likely to evolve ornamented chicks."

However, testosterone did not induce the expression of a badge in females. In staged dyadic encounters, both males and females hatched from testosterone-injected eggs were more successful at obtaining and defending a food source than individuals of the same sex hatched from control eggs.

Twenty-five female Canaries were assigned to three experimental groups; in the first group, the females were allowed to hear songs made up with attractive phrases; in the second group, they were allowed to hear songs made up with non-attractive phrases; and in the control group, the females could not hear any song.

Optimal egg size theory predicts that females should produce propagules of a size and number that maximize maternal fitness. However, studies of the allocation of resources to eggs have rarely provided evidence of such optimization. This is presumably because of constraints that limit reproductive allocation. One such example is that of pelvic aperture morphology constraining egg size in turtles. 2. Growing evidence suggests that even this classic example is incomplete. Hormones that regulate both the reproductive cycle and vitellogenic activity in turtles may provide a novel physiological mechanism for control of egg size. 3. This physiological constraint hypothesis was explored by examining the relationship between maternally derived yolk hormones and egg mass in the Painted Turtle (Chrysemyspicta, Schneider). 4. Eggs from younger females contained significantly more testosterone in the yolk than did eggs from older females. Younger females laid eggs nearly 20% smaller than those of older females even where body sizes overlapped. 5. Elevated testosterone levels in younger females may thus constrain egg size physiologically, beyond the well-known physical constraints imposed by pelvic aperture morphology. The endocrine system may play an important but previously unrecognized role in the evolution of egg size in this model system."

Experimental elevation of yolk testosterone levels enhances growth of canary chicks. Success in sibling competition, due to increased begging, is presumed to underlie this growth enhancement, because canary hatchlings from testosterone-treated eggs beg longer in response to vibrational stimuli than controls. Furthermore, experimental elevation of both yolk androstenedione and testosterone increased chick growth and begging in black-headed gulls. We measured daily growth of European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) chicks hatching from testosterone-treated or vehicle-treated (control) eggs until 14 days of age, and measured begging behavior at hatching and at 5 days of age. A temporary drought caused relatively high levels of early brood reduction for this population; 2- and 3-day-old chicks were most likely to starve. We found that chicks from testosterone-treated eggs were less likely to starve than control chicks, and were heavier on the days when most brood reduction occurred. However, chicks from testosterone-treated eggs begged less than control chicks on the day of hatching, and begged similarly at 5 days of age. Thus, while yolk testosterone did increase growth during periods of (presumably) high competition, increased begging does not appear to mediate this effect. Instead, testosterone may induce more efficient energy use, for example, by decreasing ineffective begging. While our results indicate that elevated yolk testosterone enhances survival, and thus offspring and parental fitness, further evidence regarding the fitness consequences of yolk androgens are vital to understanding their role in avian life history.  2004 Elsevier Inc.

We used subcutaneous implants to elevate testosterone (T) in captive and free-living female juncos. In captive birds, we measured the effects of high T on body mass, feather molt, and brood patch formation. In the field, we monitored its effects on the timing of egg laying, clutch size, egg size, egg steroid levels, incubation, and nest-defense behavior. Females implanted with testosterone (T-females) had significantly higher circulating levels of testosterone than did control females (C-females). Captive T-females had lower body mass, were less likely to develop brood patches, and delayed feather molt relative to C-females. Among free-living females, the interval between nest completion and appearance of the first egg was longer for T-females than for C-females and egg yolk concentrations of testosterone were higher, but there were no significant differences in estradiol levels, clutch size, or egg size. Incubation and nest defense behavior were also similar between T- and C-females. Our results suggest that selection on males for higher testosterone might initially lead to a correlated response in females producing changes in body mass and feather molt, both of which could be detrimental. Other possible female responses would be delayed onset of reproduction, which might reduce reproductive success, and higher yolk testosterone, which might have either positive or negative effects on offspring development. We found no reason to expect reduced parental behavior by females as a negative fitness consequence of selection for higher testosterone in males.  2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

The greater vulnerability of male offspring is generally attributed to their higher energy requirements associated with their larger size, although greater sensitivity to adverse conditions could be related to other factors such as negative effects of androgens on male physiology. To control for sexual differences in body size, we examined variation in offspring sex ratio in the Common Tern Sterna hirundo, a species with negligible sexual size dimorphism. In this species, the last-laid egg (termed the c-egg) is smaller than the first two and hatches last, so that the chick obtains relatively little food and hence has a low probability of survival to fledging. This species thus provides a powerful model for examining sex-linked mortality and sex ratio variation under natural conditions. We found that the sex ratio of c-eggs, but not of earlier laid eggs, was significantly biased in favour of females. Chicks hatched from c-eggs (termed c-chicks) had low survival but female c-chicks had significantly higher survival than male c-chicks. These data provide strong evidence that factors other than sexual size dimorphism are responsible for producing greater vulnerability of male offspring to adverse conditions during growth."

We integrated field and laboratory studies to jointly evaluate the significance of behavioral (nest-site choice) and physiological (yolk hormone allocation) maternal effects on offspring sex ratio in the common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina), a species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Of the 16 microhabitat variables measured, only three (south, east, and total overstory vegetation cover) were significantly correlated with nest temperature: cooler nests were located under more vegetation cover. In turn, these microhabitat predictors of nest temperature, and nest temperature itself, may influence nest sex ratio: shadier, cooler nests were more likely to produce a higher proportion of male offspring than less shady, warmer nests. Analysis of eggs from these same nests incubated in a common garden design in the laboratory revealed that clutch sex ratio was unaffected by levels of yolk estradiol, yolk testosterone, or their interaction. Examination of both behavioral and physiological maternal effects revealed no concordant impact on offspring sex ratio. However, eggs from nests that produced male-biased sex ratios in the field yielded higher proportions of males under constant-temperature conditions in the laboratory. Our study confirms the importance of behavioral maternal effects in nature on offspring sex ratios in species with TSD, while also revealing the potential presence of a predisposition for sex-ratio production underlying TSD in this system.

Plasma testosterone concentrations of the nestlings were analyzed and related to parental condition, hatching order and nestling mortality. Inexperienced parents breeding in all weather conditions and experienced parents breeding in adverse conditions were both in poor condition compared to experienced parents breeding in mild conditions. Parents in poor condition produced broods with large between-sibling differences in testosterone concentrations and their later-hatched nestlings (which had low testosterone levels) died during the early nestling period, whereas parents in good condition produced broods with lower variation in offspring testosterone concentrations and all offspring survived the early nestling period.

We predicted that when anticipating high levels of parasitism, females deposit (i) less androgens into all eggs of their clutch and (ii) smaller amounts of androgens in eggs late in the laying sequence to facilitate brood reduction. In a field experiment we exposed female great tits (Parus major) to hen fleas (Ceratophyllus gallinae), or kept them free of ectoparasites prior to egg laying. We collected the eggs and measured yolk concentrations of androstenedione (A4), testosterone (T) and 5-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by radioimmunoassay. Among clutches, eggs of ectoparasite-exposed females contained significantly less A4 and tended to contain less T, whereas DHT content was unaffected. Within clutches, content of A4 and T increased significantly with laying order whereas DHT content significantly decreased. These patterns were unaffected by ectoparasites. In summary, our results provide no evidence for hormone-based facilitation of brood reduction under ectoparasite exposure but support the hypothesis that females exposed to ectoparasites reduce levels of T and its precursor A4 in yolk and might thereby reduce the negative effects of parasites on offspring."

Yolk androgen has been shown to positively affect several fitness components at the embryo, nestling and juvenile stages. Previous experiments have shown that females lay eggs with higher androgen concentrations when they are paired with highly ornamented males. This pattern suggests that yolk androgens are costly to females. In this study, we experimentally manipulated adult female condition in zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata by modifying the level of developmental stress they suffered as nestlings. This was achieved by cross-fostering nestlings to broods of varying brood size. Subsequently, we measured the yolk testosterone contents of the female offspring that resulted from the experimental manipulation. As predicted, females deposited decreasing concentrations of testosterone with increasing brood sizes experienced as nestlings: testosterone concentration (mean  S.E.M.) of eggs laid by females from small broods, 20.662.08 pg mg-1; medium broods, 15.321.94 pg mg-1; and large broods, 14.511.66 pg mg-1. Additionally, testosterone concentration decreased with laying order, and varied with clutch size in a complex way. Differences in egg testosterone between females exposed to different brood sizes are in line with previous findings in showing that early developmental stress can affect adult reproductive performance, although our study did not detect an effect in other breeding parameters, such as latency to breed or clutch size. Furthermore, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that there is a cost associated with yolk testosterone. However, it is still unclear what the nature of this cost may be, and whether it is paid by females, offspring, or both."

However, recent findings on the effect that female social rank has on the level of egg testosterone suggest that reported associations between male-biased sex ratios and yolk testosterone may represent an indirect hormonal effect mediated by the interdependence among maternal hormones, female social rank, and sex ratio. Here, we report the results of a field experiment in which we manipulated the circulating levels of testosterone in female spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor) before egg formation. Focal females were controlled in subsequent years to explore possible delayed effects of hormone manipulation on primary sex ratio and social status that could persist because of permanent hormonal change or through hormone-dominance interactions. The results indicate that testosterone-implanted females (T-females) produced significantly more sons than control females (C-females) in the year in which they were manipulated. These differences in offspring sex ratio between T- and C-females persisted in the next 3 years, although no additional hormone treatments were given. These results were not mediated by an eventual effect of testosterone treatment on the quality of the females' mates. A similar proportion of T- and C-females acquired a nest box and bred either in the manipulation year or in Year 1 after manipulation, but T-females tended to be more successful in acquiring a nest box than C-females in Years 2 and 3 after manipulation. These results suggest that added testosterone had a direct role on the acquisition and maintenance of high social rank. Delayed effects of testosterone on primary sex ratio might have been caused by altered endogenous production of T-females. Alternatively, the maintenance of sex ratio differences between T- and C-females long after having being implanted might be attributed to the positive effect that enhanced social rank of T-females has on their circulating testosterone levels.  2004 Elsevier Inc.

Nestlings showing a large size difference with respect to their largest sibling had higher levels of both stress proteins, and this effect was stronger for female chicks as indicated by a significant interaction sex x size difference, presumably because of their higher food requirements for growth.

Heat and pressure were equally effective at inducing triploidy, and few differences between the two treatment groups in survival, growth and antibody response to intraperitoneal Listonella anguillarum (formerly Vibrio) vaccination were observed. While triploids had lower survival and poorer performance than diploids, significant differences occurred mainly during the early stages of development. Survival was mainly influenced by treatment (heat-shock, pressure-shock) and family (genotype), while growth characteristics and the immune response to vaccination were mainly influenced by family. Significant treatment-by-family interaction effects were also found; however, they explained a relatively low proportion of the total variation in survival and growth, but a large proportion of the variation in immune response. An extended effect of heat-shock treatment on survival was present even after the onset of exogenous feeding. Despite the presence of significant interaction effects, consistent performance ranking among families was generally evident, regardless of ploidy or treatment. Since substantial family effects were observed for most of the performance variables, selection applied to diploid broodstock will be part of an effective strategy for improvement of triploid offspring performance.  2004 Elsevier B.V.

This was due to higher embryonic survival of daughters compared with sons in the estradiol-treated group and the reverse in the control group. There was no effect of the hormone treatment on the primary sex ratio. Treatment with 17--estradiol led to a significantly shorter hatching time and to heavier offspring at day 7 after hatching.

Two hypotheses have gained attention to explain such a decline: the ""timing"" hypothesis proposes that deteriorating food availability causes the decline in reproductive success (causal effect of breeding time), whereas the ""quality"" hypothesis proposes that individuals of lower phenotypic quality reproduce at the end of the breeding season, causing the correlation between breeding time and breeding success. We tested both of these hypotheses in a monogamous single breeder, the magpie Pica pica, by experimentally inducing some pairs to lay a replacement clutch, after removal of the first clutch. The first clutch was left in the nest of another magpie pair (matched by laying date and clutch size), and incubated and raised by these foster parents. In this way we obtained two clutches from the same magpie pair with full siblings raised in conditions of the first and second reproductive attempts. High quality pairs (with laying dates in the first half of the breeding season) reached similar breeding success in replacement clutches as compared to first clutches of the same female. In addition, experimental pairs reared significantly more offspring of similar quality in their replacement clutches as compared to late-season first clutches, thereby suggesting that late season first clutches were produced by pairs of lower phenotypic quality. Results indicate that high quality pairs trade-off clutch size for larger eggs in replacement clutches, which could help magpie pairs to partly compensate for poorer environmental conditions associated with a delayed breeding attempt."

In part, this is because we lack detailed information about the day-to-day pattern of changes in plasma hormone levels during the laying cycle for non-domesticated birds. Here, we describe changes in plasma estradiol-17 (E2) and androgens, throughout laying in relation to specific stages of ovarian follicular development in the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris). Plasma E2 levels increased rapidly from the onset of rapid yolk development (RYD) to reach maximum levels in birds with a complete follicle hierarchy (4 yolky follicles). However, levels decreased linearly throughout the later stages of follicle development returning to pre-breeding values before the final yolky follicle was ovulated. In females with 4 yolky follicles there was 10-fold variation in plasma E2 levels among individual females, but this was not related to plasma levels of the main yolk precursor vitellogenin or to the total mass of yolky follicles developing at the time of blood sampling. In contrast to E2, plasma androgen levels showed only a very gradual linear decline throughout the laying cycle from pre-RYD to clutch completion. Furthermore, androgen levels showed less individual variability: 4-fold variation among females with 4 yolky follicles, although this was also independent of our measures of reproductive function.

The temporal pattern of hatching in an avian clutch has a large effect on size and developmental disparities among chicks. Hatching spread is generally assumed to be mainly determined by the onset of incubation in relation to egg laying. However, the extent to which factors other than incubation onset, such as development rate, also influence timing of hatching has received little empirical investigation. We compared incubation periods of male and female black guillemot ( Cepphus grylle) embryos to ascertain whether the time taken for an egg to hatch varies with embryo sex. Laying date and egg mass had no significant effect on incubation time, but male embryos hatched on average a day sooner than did females. The onset of incubation and hatching spread vary in black guillemots. However, in mixed-sexed clutches in which the first-laid embryo is male, a faster development time of males should mean asynchronous hatching regardless of parental incubation regime. This was supported by empirical investigation. These results demonstrate that factors other than incubation behavior can be important in establishing avian hatching patterns. Whether these sex differences in development rate are a result of constraints on the degree of parental control, or an adaptive strategy to manipulate hatching patterns, remains to be established."

Sequence analysis indicates many steroidogenic and steroid-inactivating enzymes, including cytochrome P450s and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs), arose at the same time. The estrogen receptor (ER) appears to be the ancestral steroid receptor. Initially, the redundant duplicated ER had a low specificity for its new ligand. This raises the question: ""How was specificity for responses to different steroids regulated early in the evolution of steroid receptors?"" Selective expression of these steroid-metabolizing enzymes provided specificity for different steroid responses in primitive vertebrates. 17-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-type 1 (17-HSD-type 1) and 17-HSD-type 2, which preferentially catalyze the reduction and oxidation at C17 of androgens and estrogens, respectively, provide an example of this mechanism. Selective expression of either 17-HSD-type 1 or 17-HSD-type 2 can regulate synthesis or inactivation of androgens or estrogens in specific cells. Steroids also were important in the evolution of land animals, which began about 400 million years ago. Steroidogenic and steroid-inactivating enzymes were recruited to regulate steroid-mediated responses as organ function became more complex. For example, in the kidney 11-HSD-type 2 prevents binding of glucocorticoids to the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), which is crucial for aldosterone-mediated regulation of electrolyte transport in the distal tubule.

Optimal allocation of maternal steroids to zygotes may be difficult to achieve because of the sexually antagonistic effects of steroids; thus, for example, a hormone environment beneficial to a developing male may be much less beneficial to a developing female. Research into the important topic of how mothers might adaptively adjust steroid titres experienced by particular young has been constrained by the difficulty of measuring the steroid environment experienced by the embryo at critical times in development. A potential approach to this problem has been suggested by research on variation in digit ratios in humans, where the ratio of the length of the second and fourth digits reflects the steroid environment experienced by the foetus; notably, digit 4 lengthens in response to androgens. In light of the conservative nature of homeobox genes regulating early development in tetrapods, we questioned whether a sex difference in digit ratio exists in a passerine bird, the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata castanotis, and whether observed variation in the ratio is consistent with the previously reported pattern that androgen allocation to zebra finch egg yolk declines across laying order. We established an aviary population of outbred, wild-type zebra finches, and allowed them to breed freely. Hatchlings were marked to correspond to their egg order, and their digit ratios were measured after birds reached adulthood. We found that digit ratio increased across egg order, which is consistent with a pattern of decreasing androgen allocation. Moreover, digit ratios differed between the sexes. We also investigated whether variation in digit ratio among adult females predicted variation in their performance in mate-choice tests. Digit ratio accounted for almost 50% of the variance in strength of female preference for an attractive male trait: specifically, females with higher (presumably less 'androgenized') ratios had stronger preferences for attractive males. Digit ratio may prove to be an extremely useful tool for addressing a wide range of questions about vertebrate differentiation and behaviour."

High breeding density can cause elevated plasma androgen levels in adult birds. Since maternal androgens are deposited into egg yolk, high breeding density may result in elevated yolk androgen levels as well. 2. The relationship between breeding density and yolk androgen levels was examined in the European Starling, Sturnus vulgaris. The concentration and total content of yolk androstenedione and yolk testosterone were measured in eggs from 24 clutches distributed across nine different colonies of nestboxes. 3. Yolk androstenedione and testosterone levels were significantly higher in colonies where a greater proportion of nestboxes had active nests. 4. Yolk testosterone levels were significantly higher, and yolk androstenedione levels were marginally higher, in colonies with a greater absolute number of active nests. 5. Yolk androgen levels were not related to the number of active nests in adjacent nestboxes. 6. We conclude that female starlings nesting in colonies with higher breeding densities transfer more androgen to their eggs. 7. This relationship may be mediated by increased interfemale aggression, particularly towards floater females searching for mates or nests to brood parasitize, in high-density colonies. Such a relationship between maternal environment and maternal yolk androgens may represent adaptive maternal modification of offspring phenotype or a non-adaptive physiological constraint which females cannot avoid."

Greater maternal investment in yolk steroids may provide an explanation for the vigour of parasitic chicks. Unexpectedly we found no evidence of higher yolk T concentration and absolute amount of T in cuckoo eggs compared to those of its host, the great reed warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus. The yolk mass of cuckoo eggs, however, was significantly greater than that of the host, despite egg volumes being similar between these two species. Relatively larger yolks of cuckoo eggs indicates differential maternal investment strategies by parasites as more yolk may contain additional macronutrients to increase the vigour of parasitic young during the early days of its life and/or to enhance its begging display to elicit care from foster parents.  2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

We also found that daughters differed in their choosiness during mate-choice experiments depending on whether they originated from eggs produced early or late within the laying sequence of a clutch. Because this effect of laying order occurred independently of hatching order in cross-fostered broods, it must have been caused by consistent within-mother variation in maternal effects transmitted through the egg. Our findings raise the question whether these maternal effects might represent strategic programming of offspring behavior in response to the environment experienced by mothers or whether they are merely nonadaptive byproducts of developmental processes."

Using long-term data in a viviparous lizard, Lacerta vivipara, we investigated the relationship between prenatal sex ratio and offspring growth, survival, and reproductive traits as adults. Our results show that females from male-biased clutches grow faster, mature earlier, but have lower fecundity than females from female-biased clutches. Furthermore, male reproduction was also affected by the sex ratio during embryonic development, with males from male-biased clutches being more likely to successfully reproduce at age one than males from female-biased clutches. Thus, the sex ratio experienced during gestation can have profound and long-lasting effects on fitness in natural populations of viviparous animals, with important implications for life-history evolution and sex allocation."

To the extent that the expression of male ornaments is a signal of male quality, we expect females to increase their investment when paired to highly ornamented males. However, female investment may be cryptic and difficult to detect, such as androgen content in the eggs. In this study, we exposed female canaries (Serinus canaria) to attractive and unattractive song repertoires using a crossover design. As predicted, females invested greater concentrations of testosterone in their eggs when exposed to attractive repertoires than when exposed to unattractive repertoires.

The avian oviduct is a highly differentiated linear organ, with five functionally specific regions. Here we show that the oviduct regresses rapidly 'from the top down' as soon as the more proximal regions have completed their function but while the distal regions still retain an oviductal egg. In zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata, oviduct mass did not differ between early laying birds at the 1-egg stage compared with late-laying birds (with one remaining yolky follicle; dry mass, 151-167 mg). However, in birds with no remaining yolky follicles but with an oviductal egg, oviduct mass decreased to 94 mg (44%). Regression occurred unequally among different regions of the oviduct, with significant decreases in the proximal infundibulum/magnum and isthmus regions (59% and 40%, respectively), but no change in distal shell gland/vagina mass. The shell gland did not regress until after the last oviposition. Thus, the avian oviduct has a highly regulated size-function relationship consistent with a high maintenance energy cost for this organ. We suggest that oviduct function is a significant contributor to the physiological costs of egg production and might mediate individual variation in maternal effects associated with non-yolk components of egg quality (e.g. immunoglobulins, lysozyme)."

This is due to primary sex-ratio adjustment and female-biased nestling mortality. Given that young females fledging at low body masses have been shown to have low fecundity as adults, lower returns to parents from producing female offspring in conditions of restricted food has been raised as a functional explanation (Trivers and Willard's hypothesis of adaptive sexual investment; 1973). However, an alternative, mechanistic hypothesis is that under restricted conditions female chicks are more costly to produce. In consequence, lower returns to parents under these conditions would happen earlier in the life of female offspring rather than later. To test this hypothesis, I hand-reared chicks on a food gradient. In the absence of parent-offspring and sib-sib interactions, final body mass and growth rates for females were lower in conditions of restricted food. For males, final body mass and growth rates did not differ with food condition. Low female growth rates in food-restricted conditions might be one potential mechanism causing female-biased mortality in birds. More importantly, this result is the strongest evidence yet of female offspring experiencing higher marginal fitness benefits from additional food than males and it has implications for primary and secondary sex-ratio adjustment. Also, as this mechanism has been shown in the absence of parent-offspring interactions, significant questions can now be raised as to how parental and offspring behavior interact in their effects on secondary sex-ratio adjustment."

We tested the hypotheses that corticosterone in avian egg yolk should correlate with corticosterone in maternal circulation at the time of laying, and that high corticosterone in yolk should then influence offspring development and adult phenotype. We implanted female Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) with corticosterone-filled or empty implants and measured concentrations of corticosterone in the yolk of their eggs. Then we incubated the eggs and raised the chicks to test for effects on growth and hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal response to capture and restraint in adult offspring. We found that corticosterone implants significantly increased corticosterone in yolk. Furthermore, chicks of corticosterone-implanted mothers grew more slowly than controls and showed higher activity of the hypothalamo-adrenal axis in response to capture and restraint as adults. These results suggest that stress experienced by a laying bird has significant effects on offspring development and adult phenotype, possibly mediated by the transfer of maternal corticosterone to yolk.  2003 Elsevier Inc.

Corticosterone implants (5 mg, slow-release) administered to females in mid-pregnancy caused a large elevation of corticosterone in maternal plasma (P<0.001), probable reductions in embryonic growth and development (P=0.069-0.073), developmental abnormalities and eventual abortions. Cool temperature produced similar reductions in embryonic growth and development (P0.036 cf. warm controls), but pregnancies were eventually successful. Despite the potentially harmful effects of elevated plasma corticosterone, pregnant females did not suppress their corticosterone response to capture and confinement relative to vitellogenic females, and both groups of females had higher responses than males. Future research should address whether lower maternal doses of corticosterone produce non-lethal effects on development that could contribute to phenotypic plasticity. Corticosterone implants also led to increased basking in pregnant females (P<0.001), and basal corticosterone in wild geckos (independent of reproductive condition) was positively correlated with body temperature (P<0.001).

Here, we experimentally investigated whether socially stressful conditions experienced by female house sparrows during egg laying affected their circulating levels of androgens and the amount transferred to the eggs. Social stress was simulated by the intrusion of a foreign male placed near the nest box during the egg-laying sequence. We found that (1) both female and yolk testosterone titres were positively related to breeding density; (2) yolk testosterone was negatively correlated with maternal testosterone; (3) yolk testosterone was positively correlated with the behavioural response of females towards the intruder and (4) the interaction between social intrusion and breeding density affected the amount of testosterone transferred to the eggs.

A strong positive correlation between egg size and days until spawning with the second male was found for the females initially paired to a small and then a large male. Within a few days, these females apparently increased their egg size to match the attractiveness of their new male. No correlation between days until spawning and egg size in females initially paired to a large and then a small male, however was found, so apparently females were unable to adjust egg size in response to a decrease in mate attractiveness.

We also measured circulating levels of T in females immediately after laying. Egg androgens could affect offspring performance directly through chick development and/or indirectly through changes in the competitive ability of a chick relative to its siblings. To avoid confounding these two routes, and to separate effects operating through the egg itself with those operating through experimental changes in parental chick rearing capacity, we fostered eggs from both maternal treatment groups singly into the nests of unmanipulated parents. Contrary to expectation, mothers with experimentally enhanced body condition laid eggs with lower levels of androgens, while exhibiting higher circulating T concentrations post-laying. Despite these lower levels of egg androgen, offspring hatched from eggs laid by mothers in good condition did not show reduced growth or survival when reared in the absence of sibling competition. Our results demonstrate that yolk androgen concentrations vary with the body condition of the female at the time of egg formation and that females in good condition reduced the yolk androgen content of their eggs without altering offspring performance."

Therefore, we examined the extent to which T and E2 are coupled in plasma and yolking follicles in adult females and explored the dynamics of yolk and embryo steroid content during egg incubation in green anoles (Anolis carolinensis). T and E2 levels were determined for the plasma and yolking follicles of breeding females and for whole embryos and yolks at several developmental stages by radioimmunoassay. Plasma and yolk concentrations of T and E2 were not correlated. On average, plasma T was only 30% that of plasma E2, but yolking follicle T was over 600% that of yolking follicle E2. Total yolk T and E2 content generally declined over the course of incubation. However, yolk T was an order of magnitude higher than yolk E2, and it showed a secondary peak in magnitude after approximately 75% of incubation was completed. Similarly, total embryonic T content rose by over 400% in the latter half of incubation whereas E2 did not change. These results demonstrate that plasma and yolking follicle steroid levels produced by breeding females can be uncoupled.

Starvation due to this competitive disadvantage has been regarded as the primary cause of an increase in mortality with hatching order. However, for gulls it has also been suggested that disease is the cause of mortality for last-hatched chicks, possibly through reduced immunocompetence and thereby an enhanced susceptibility to infection. In addition, the male-biased mortality reported for several gull species may be related to a higher vulnerability to diseases in males compared to females. To determine the potential influence of the immune system on these mortality patterns, we investigated the T-cell-mediated immunity (CMI) of black-headed gull chicks in relation to hatching order and sex. We found a significant decrease in the CMI with hatching order. This result may be causally related to systematic changes in maternal yolk steroids and carotenoids within the laying sequence. For second-laid eggs, male CMI was significantly lower than female CMI. This is possibly linked to higher plasma levels of testosterone in male embryos which might have an immunosuppressive effect. If so, this effect is masked in eggs of either high (first egg) or low (last egg) quality. Chicks with low CMI showed enhanced mortality rates. Thus the differences in immune response are likely to contribute to the observed mortality patterns. However, hatching order significantly affected mortality independently of CMI, suggesting that competitive disadvantage due to hatching asynchrony is also important."

Over the past few years there has been a surge of reports documenting the ability of birds to overcome the rigid process of chromosomal sex determination. However, while many of these studies leave us in little doubt that mechanisms allowing birds to achieve this feat do exist, we are only left with tantalizing suggestions as to what the precise mechanism or mechanisms may be. The quest to elucidate them is made no easier by the fact that a variety of environmental conditions have been invoked in relation to sex manipulation, and there is no reason to assume that any particular mechanism is conserved among the vast diversity of species that can achieve it. In fact, a number of intriguing proposals have been put forward. We begin by briefly reviewing some of the most recent examples of this phenomenon before highlighting some of the more plausible mechanisms, drawing on recent work from a variety of taxa. In birds, females are the heterogametic sex and so non-Mendelian segregation of the sex chromosomes could conceivably be under maternal control. Another suggestion is that follicles that ultimately give rise to males and females grow at different rates. Alternatively, the female might selectively abort embryos or 'dump lay' eggs of a particular sex, deny certain ova a chance of ovulation, fertilization or zygote formation, or selectively provision eggs so that there is sex-specific embryonic mortality. The ideas outlined in this review provide good starting points for testing the hypotheses both experimentally (behaviourally and physiologically) and theoretically.  Cambridge Philosophical Society."

In some species, females increase their reproductive effort by differentially allocating resources after mating with high-quality males. Examination of female reproductive effort in relation to male quality has implications for estimating the evolvability of traits and for sexual-selection models. Accurate quantification of reproductive investment is not possible in many species. Butterflies are an exception, as most nectar-feeding species emerge with almost intact reproductive resources, and in some species males provide nutrients at mating that enhance female fecundity. By manipulating male donations and using radioactive isotopes, we quantified the effect of variation in nutrient provisioning on female reproductive effort in two butterfly species. In the green-veined white butterfly, Pieris napi, females increased their reproductive effort after receiving large male donations. By contrast, in the speckled wood, Pararge aegeria, where males do not provide nutrients, female reproductive effort was independent of male ejaculate. Increased reproductive effort in Pieris napi resulted from the production of more eggs, rather than from investing more resources per egg. In this species donating ability is heritable; hence females laying more eggs after mating with high-donating males benefit both through higher fecundity and through the production of high-donating sons."

A number of studies have demonstrated a positive relationship between paternal attractiveness and offspring quality. However, this pattern could be due to inheritance of paternal genes and/or it could be due to increased maternal investment in the offspring of more attractive males. To isolate female responses to male appearance from paternal genetic effects, I housed female red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) with vasectomized (sterile) males and artificially inseminated them. Male junglefowl with larger combs are more attractive to females. Females laid more eggs when housed with a large-combed, as opposed to a small-combed, vasectomized mate. Neither egg volume nor offspring body condition was associated with comb size of the mother's vasectomized mate. Paternal genetics appeared important. Body condition and comb size were greater for the sons of large-combed sperm donor males. This is consistent with the hypothesis that genetic benefits to offspring maintain female preference for the most ornate males. It is possible that greater body condition and comb size in sons of large-combed sires was not caused by genetic differences, but instead was due to compounds in the ejaculate of large-combed sperm donors inducing greater reproductive investment from females. However, females artificially inseminated by large-combed males did not produce more or larger eggs than females artificially inseminated by small-combed males, and thus there is no other evidence consistent with ejaculate-induced differential investment. Furthermore, only in older chicks was body condition significantly related to sire comb size, suggesting genetic rather than differential investment mechanisms."

Egg size and composition may influence the duration of incubation and hatching periods, and eggs bearing embryos of different sex may differ in size and composition. Therefore, the sex of the embryo could also influence its ontogeny before hatching. We tested this prediction by investigating the duration of the embryonic period of different-sex embryos in the Eurasian kestrel (Falco tinnunculus), a sexually dimorphic raptor in which adult females are approximately 20% heavier than are adult males. We found the first evidence of sex differences in the duration of the embryonic period in avian eggs. Female embryos had a shorter embryonic period than did male embryos, which allowed females to hatch earlier in the hatching sequence and assume a higher rank than that of males in the intrabrood size hierarchy. Embryos with a fast growth and development resulted in hatchlings with greater residual reserves and thus larger mass, which suggests that a shorter embryonic period requires less maintenance metabolism relative to growth. Our results also indicated that early hatching may be advantageous to gain a high rank in the size hierarchy within the brood independently of the effect of sex on fledgling mass. Sex differences in avian egg ontogeny may therefore be a factor shaping life-history traits associated with parental control of sibling competition, which should be addressed in any future work on optimal reproductive investment."

Previous experiments have shown that chicks benefit from these higher levels since their competitive abilities are improved and growth and survival probabilities thus enhanced. However, not all females show the same increase in yolk hormones from first to last egg or invest equally high amounts of androgens in their clutches. Possibly, there is a trade-off between the beneficial effects of high androgen levels and potential costs, such as increased metabolic rates. We studied possible metabolic costs of experimentally elevated yolk androgen levels for chicks of several age classes, starting three days prior to hatching until fledging at an age of approximately 30 days. Daily energy expenditure in the field, measured using the doubly labelled water technique, did not differ between treatments or between sexes. Oxygen consumption measured in birds at rest in the lab (RMR) did not vary between chicks hatched from androgen-injected (T) or oil-injected (Oil) control eggs at any age in thermo-neutral or below thermo-neutral conditions.

Parasites can affect host fitness, provoke host responses, and thereby mediate host life history evolution. As life history strategies are often sex-specific, immunological or behavioural responses of the host aiming to reduce the impact of parasites may be sexually dimorphic, e.g. as a consequence of sex differences in the resource allocation trade-off between parasite defence, morphological traits and body functions. Parasites may therefore affect males and females differently leading to sex specific patterns of parasite susceptibility. 2. In an experimental field study, we manipulated the ectoparasite load of great tit nests (Parus major) and investigated its effects on male and female nestlings. As susceptibility to parasites may be linked to the ability of the nestlings to fight off parasites immunologically, we further investigated sex differences in cell-mediated immunity using a phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) assay. 3. Body mass, metatarsus length and overall body size, but not feather length, showed a sexual dimorphism at the end of the nestling period. A significant interaction between the effects of sex and parasite treatment on the sexually dimorphic traits indicates that the parasite effect is sex-specific. While no differences in morphological traits were found in females raised in infested and uninfested nests, parasitized males were significantly smaller and lighter than males raised in uninfested nests. Further, we found a pronounced sexual dimorphism in the response to the PHA assay with males showing a reduced cellular immunity. The parasite treatment had a non-significant effect on the PHA response and the PHA response of males and females were not influenced differently by parasites. 4. Our study shows that sexual dimorphism in susceptibility to parasites and immunocompetence develops early in life, and suggests sex-specific strategies in the allocation of limited resources. Possible mechanisms of sex differences in susceptibility to parasites and immunocompetence during postnatal growth and the consequences for optimal sex allocation strategies of the parents are discussed."

In 2 of 3 years, we found that females paired to males with relatively brighter UV-coloration produced a greater proportion of sons in their broods, and that this effect was significant with all 3 years combined, despite a significant year by male UV interaction. In addition, we found other correlates of sex ratio (breeding time, female age and clutch size) in some, but not all years, and some of these showed significantly different relationships with sex ratio between years. In both years for which data were available, there were indications that males with relatively brighter UV coloration, and that paired with females that produced male-biased clutches, were more likely to survive to the next year. In addition, we also found that in both males and females, individuals produced similar sex ratios in consecutive years. Because correlations with the sex ratio may be expected to be weak, variation in results between years within the same population may be explained by low statistical power or genuine biological differences. Our results suggest that conclusions about sex ratio variation in birds should be based on multiple years. The correlations that we found in some years of this study are consistent with models of adaptive sex ratio adjustment in response to mate quality. However, careful experimental work is required to provide tests of the assumptions of these models, and should be a priority for future work."

Maternal choice of nest site is generally thought to respond more rapidly to sex ratio selection than environmental sensitivity of offspring sex (threshold temperatures) in reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD, a form of ESD). However, knowledge of the evolutionary potential for either of these traits in a field setting is limited. I developed a simulation model using local climate data and observed levels of phenotypic variation for nest-site choice and threshold temperatures in painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) with TSD. Both nest-site choice and threshold temperatures, and hence sex ratios, evolved slowly to simulated climate change scenarios. In contrast to expectations from previous models, nest-site choice evolved more slowly than threshold temperatures because of large climatic effects on nest temperatures and indirect selection on maternally expressed traits. A variant of the model, assuming inheritance of nest-site choice through natal imprinting, demonstrated that natal imprinting inhibited adaptive responses in female nest-site choice to climate change. These results predict that females have relatively low potential to adaptively adjust sex ratios through nest-site choice."

Using a norm of reaction approach, I introduce and illustrate the complexities of phenotypic development. Next, I consider the implications of environmental selection and niche construction for phenotypic development, and consider why these behavioural processes are likely to encourage the development and maintenance of repeatable, stable individual differences and trait syndromes. Parental effects involving behaviour also affect the development of a wide array of phenotypic traits; differential allocation is a currently underappreciated type of parental effect, by which males can affect the development of their offspring via nongenetic means, even if those males have no contact with their young. Behavioural parental effects also contribute to extragenetic inheritance, and recent studies suggest that this phenomenon may be more widespread than previously suspected.

Moreover, it has recently been hypothesized that sex steroids of maternal origin may play a role in adaptive sex ratio manipulation. For sex determination the eggs have to be incubated to allow the germinal disc to grow and thus extract sufficient DNA. This means that yolk hormone levels are determined after a number of days of incubation and this may hamper interpretation of the data. If yolk utilization or embryonic hormone production are influenced by the sex of the embryo, differences in hormone content at a certain stage of incubation do not reflect the mother's initial allocation. In this experiment we show that testosterone levels in chicken eggs do not change with incubation period. A4 levels decrease between 3 and 5 days of incubation, which we cannot explain. Male eggs did not contain higher levels of testosterone or androstenedione than female eggs, in contrast to the data reported for another galliform species, the peacock.

Mothers allocated more antibodies against a pathogen to eggs with a daughter than a son. However, concentration of antioxidants was independent of embryonic sex. Sex-dependent allocation was independent of paternal attractiveness. Thus, mothers adjusted allocation of substances to offspring in a complex manner, that may be part of a strategy of favouritism of daughters, which have larger mortality than sons.

We subsequently monitored maternal investment as a function of male hormonal treatment and the size of the black patch of feathers on the throat (i.e., the badge), a sexually selected trait. The differential allocation hypothesis predicts that females should adjust their investment with respect to the benefits they receive by mating with an attractive male. Given that both circulating levels of T and badge size are condition-dependent traits, we expected that females mated with T males and/or with large-badged males should invest more into current reproduction. Contrary to this prediction, we found no evidence that suggested differential maternal allocation in this population of house sparrows. Female investment in yolk T, yolk mass, clutch size, chick brooding, and feeding was not affected by male hormonal treatment or by male badge size. As expected, T males invested less into chick brooding and feeding. More surprisingly, females did not compensate the reduced paternal contribution to chick feeding. As a consequence, the breeding success of T pairs was largely reduced compared with that of C pairs. The absence of differential allocation in a system in which it could have an adaptive role raises the question about the possible constraints or overriding factors operating on patterns of reproductive investment in this species."

This hypothesis predicts that females of high quality or high reproductive potential should invest more yolk androgens in their eggs than females of low quality or low reproductive potential. We tested these predictions by examining interfemale variation in allocation of the androgenic steroids testosterone and androstenedione to eggs in a wild population of European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris. We collected 30 full clutches of eggs and captured 22 of the females that laid these clutches for phenotypic measurements. In agreement with the hypothesis, we found that there was significant interfemale variation in yolk androgen concentrations. Furthermore, older females deposited more androstenedione and testosterone in eggs than 1-year-old females, and females laying early or large clutches deposited more testosterone in eggs than females laying late or small clutches. However, females in good body condition did not deposit more androgens in eggs than females in poor body condition. Large-yolked eggs had a higher total yolk androgen content than small-yolked eggs, but larger eggs did not have higher concentrations of yolk androgens. The results in general support the investment hypothesis of yolk androgen allocation.

By examining parthenogenetically reproducing females, we isolate the effects of social environment in the absence of mating or fertilization. Females exposed to male odors are more likely to produce parthenogenetic offspring. Further, increased exposure to the male pheromone increases the number of offspring produced. Variation in timing of reproduction is also dependent on the male. Thus, social environments are a mechanism by which males contribute to the development of their offspring, resulting in variation in development. This study illustrates the potential evolutionary importance of social environments in development, because a requirement for male-contributed environments may be a constraint to evolving asexual reproduction from a sexually reproducing species."

Females developing in male-biased clutches had a more masculine allometry (relatively larger heads) at parturition than females developing in female-biased clutches.

Whereas these maternal effects should evolve to accommodate the adaptations of both the maternal and offspring generations, the mechanisms by which this is accomplished are rarely known. In birds, females adjust the onset of incubation (coincident with the first egg or after all eggs are laid) in response to the environment during breeding, and thus, indirectly, determine the duration of offspring growth. In the two house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus) populations that breed at the extremes of the species' distribution (Montana and Alabama), females experience highly distinct climatic conditions during nesting. We show that in close association with these conditions, females adjusted jointly the onset of incubation and the sequence in which they produced male and female eggs and consequently modified the growth of sons and daughters. The onset of incubation in newly breeding females closely tracked ambient temperature in a pattern consistent with the maintenance of egg viability. Because of the very different climates in Montana and Alabama, females in these populations showed the opposite patterns of seasonal change in incubation onset and the opposite sex bias in egg-laying order. In females with breeding experience, incubation onset and sex bias in laying order were closely linked regardless of the climatic variation. In nests in which incubation began with the onset of egg laying, the first-laid eggs were mostly females in Montana, but mostly males in Alabama. Because in both populations, male, but not female, embryos grew faster when exposed to longer incubation, the sex-bias produced highly divergent sizes of male and female juveniles between the populations. Overall, the compensatory interaction between the onset of incubation and the sex-biased laying order achieved a compromise between maternal and offspring adaptations and contributed to rapid morphological divergence in sexual dimorphism between populations of the house finch breeding at the climatic extremes of the species range."

These hormones can have profound influences in the development of the embryo and the nestling, and even shape the phenotype of the adult bird. In this review I evaluate the research that has been developed in the last ten years in this field, and I suggest several lines of research that might be worth following in the future. Evidence shows that high levels of androgens in eggs speed up embryonic development and boost muscular growth and begging rates in nestlings. A study in captivity with canaries Serinus domesticus has identified an influence of egg androgen in the social hierarchy of the adult bird. Research is needed to ascertain long-term effects of egg androgens in the wild, but the picture is a promising one. Several studies have found a positive correlation between female hormone levels and those of the egg. However, it is still not clear whether this is the result of passive transfer or, on the contrary, there are mechanisms that control the transfer of hormones from the mother to the egg. Whatever the mechanism, several experiments show that females lay eggs with higher concentrations of androgens when paired to attractive mates. This pattern of differential allocation suggests that egg androgens are a costly resource, and that there are limiting factors for the mother or the offspring. Research has uncovered several other interesting patterns, such as differences between male and female bearing eggs in androgen levels, or a positive covariance with breeding density in different colonies of the same species. Another exciting issue concerns the uneven distribution of egg androgen within the same clutch. It has been suggested that females could use this mechanism to control aggression and competition among nestlings. To summarise, egg androgen allocation constitutes a powerful mechanism which females could use to modify offspring phenotype. Large between-species differences in egg androgen concentrations suggest that a comparative analysis may be the best tool to understand the role of the many ecological and evolutionary factors that have shaped the evolution of this character."

Experiments have supported the hypothesis that this within-clutch variation in maternal androgens mitigates the disadvantage of last-hatched chicks in sibling competition, by enhancing embryonic development and early posthatching growth. We hypothesized that these effects come about by the stimulating effects of maternal androgens on begging behaviour and competitive ability. In the field, we injected first-laid eggs of a clutch (which have a low androgen level) with either an androgen solution (T eggs) or vehicle (Oil eggs). We then created pairs of chicks hatched from Oil and T eggs, matched for egg mass and hatching date. Parent-chick interactions were recorded from observation hides. Chicks from T eggs hatched almost half a day sooner than those from Oil eggs. Furthermore, chicks from T eggs were more active during the first week after hatching, were more often the first to react to the approaching parent, begged more frequently, and obtained the larger share of food. We conclude that the enhancing effect of yolk androgens on growth in this species arises at least partly through androgen-mediated effects on the chicks' behaviour.  2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

What is the developmental basis of this difference between parasite and its host species? Previous studies showed that intraspecific differences in some maternally deposited egg-yolk steroid hormone concentrations were related to differences in the begging behaviors and growth of hatchling birds. The prediction was tested that interspecific variation in yolk testosterone concentrations was related to consistent differences in the begging of hosts vs. parasites. Contrary to this prediction, yolk testosterone levels in the eggs of brown-headed cowbirds were not consistently higher than in host species: cowbird testosterone concentration was higher than in eastern phoebes (Sayornis phoebe), lower than in yellow warblers (Dendroica petechia), and similar to red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus). These results show that variation in egg-yolk testosterone concentrations alone is not related causally to differences in the begging behaviors between parasitic and host bird species. Nonetheless, it remains feasible that interspecific variation in both maternally deposited testosterone concentrations and embryonic hormone-receptor distribution together function to shape phenotypic differences in behavior and growth rate between avian hatchlings of different taxa."

First, dominant females, but not subdominant females, allocated significantly more testosterone to male eggs than to female eggs. Second, subordinate females increased the testosterone concentrations of female eggs. This pattern of yolk hormone deposition can be functionally explained. In polygynous species such as the chicken, reproductive success is more variable in males than in females. Parental investment in sons or daughters is therefore expected to occur in direct relation to parental rearing capacities. We found that the social status of a hen was indeed negatively correlated with her maternal capacities (for example, body mass, egg mass). Differential androgen deposition might thus provide a mechanism for adaptive maternal investment depending on both the sex of the egg and the social status of the mother."

In two recently colonized environments, breeding female house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) modified the sex and growth of their offspring in relation to the order in which eggs were laid in a clutch. Here we show that, in both populations, these maternal effects strongly biased frequency distribution of tarsus size of fully grown males and females and ultimately produced population divergence in this trait. Although in each population, male and female offspring show a wide range of growth patterns, maternal modifications of sex-ratio in relation to egg-laying order resulted in under-representation of the morphologies that were selected against and over-representation of morphologies that were favoured by the local selection on juveniles. The result of these maternal adjustments was fast phenotypic change in sexual size dimorphism within and between populations. Maternal manipulations of offspring morphologies may be especially important at the initial stages of population establishment in the novel environments and may have facilitated recent colonization of much of North America by the house finch."

Field and laboratory experiments have shown that initial egg cortisol concentrations directly influence the size at hatching of the benthic spawning damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis. The present study examines the mechanism by which cortisol influences larval size at hatching by investigating the growth and developmental rhythms throughout embryogenesis. Newly spawned eggs of P. amboinensis were collected from natural benthic nests, and half of each clutch was incubated in a moderate level of cortisol (2.7  10-6 M, equivalent to a concentration of 0.79 pg/egg). Cortisol was found to have no affect on the rate of cell-pulsations up to epiboly (18 hr post-fertilization), with cells pulsing at a mean rate of 56-60 pulses/min. Cortisol had an affect on the relative growth rate from the start of gastrulation to knot formation. Growth in the cortisol-supplemented embryos was pulsed, with periods of fast growth punctuated by long periods of stasis. Overall growth rates during this period were lower in the cortisol-supplemented embryos despite their higher growth during active periods. Pulse rates of somite cells and contraction rhythms of myotomes and the heart were twice as high in cortisol-supplemented embryos than controls. Despite this, cortisol-supplemented eggs developed at the same rate as controls and hatched at the same time. This study suggests that the maternal endowment of cortisol to eggs plays a vital role in determining the embryonic rhythms by which embryos grow and may be directly influencing metabolism.  2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

In addition, we studied sex-allocation in relation to parentage, parental age and expression of a secondary sexual character of fathers. Molecular sexing was conducted using the sex chromosome-linked avian CHD1 gene. Sex of the offspring was not associated with laying or hatching order. None of nine morphological, serological and immunological variables varied in relation to offspring sex. Sexual dimorphism did not vary in relation to parental age and expression of a paternal secondary sexual character. The proportion of sons declined with brood size. Individual males and females had a similar proportion of sons during consecutive breeding years. The proportion of sons of individual females declined with age, but increased with the expression of a secondary sexual character of their current mate. The generalized lack of variation in sexual dimorphism among nestlings may suggest that barn swallows do not differentially invest in sons vs. daughters. Alternatively, male offspring may require different parental effort Compared to their female siblings in order to attain the same morphological state. The lack of variation in offspring sexual dimorphism with paternal ornamentation suggests no adjustment of overall parental effort in relation to reproductive value of the two sexes. However, male-biased sex ratio among offspring of highly ornamented males may represent an adaptive sex-allocation strategy because the expression of male ornaments is heritable and highly ornamented males are at a sexual selection advantage."

We used tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) to examine the possibility of transgenerational immunity and its effect on nestling growth and immune development. We measured cell-mediated immunity with a delayed-hypersensitivity assay and antibody-mediated immunity with a hemagglutination test with sheep red blood cells (SRBCs). We tested for differences in immunocompetence and growth between nestlings from females who had been exposed to a novel antigen prior to egg laying and nestlings from unexposed females. To determine whether the effect, if any, resulted from something transferred to the eggs prior to egg laying or from subsequent changes in parental behaviour, nestlings were exchanged so that at each nest half the nestlings were from females who had been injected with SRBCs and half were from females who had not been exposed to SRBCs. Finally, brood sizes were independently manipulated to either 4 or 6 nestlings. We failed to detect maternal antibodies in any nestlings, and whether a female was exposed to SRBCs or not had no effect on the growth or cell-mediated immunity of her brood. However, nestlings in smaller broods grew better than nestlings in larger broods, though we did not find the expected differences in cell-mediated immunity. Furthermore, within each nest, nestlings whose mothers had been exposed to SRBCs grew better than nestlings whose mothers had not been exposed. These results are contrary to the idea of a simple trade-off in the allocation of resources between parasite protection and reproduction; however, they support the idea that exposure of females to parasites prior to egg laying leads to better nestling growth, and are congruous with the possibility of mithridatic parental care."

Females of egg-laying vertebrates may adjust the development of their offspring to prevailing environmental conditions by regulating the deposition of hormones into their eggs. Within- and amng-clutch variation in levels of steroid hormones were studied in the egg yolks of the Black-Headed Gull (Larus ridibundus, Linnaeus) in relation to environmental conditions at the nest site. This species breeds in colonies of different densities and in different habitats, and the chicks hatch asynchronously. 2. Egg yolks contained very high levels of androstenedione, substantial levels of testosterone and moderate levels of 5-dihydrotestosterone. Oestrogen (17-oestradiol) was not detected. 3. Androgen levels increased strongly with laying order, irrespective of egg or yolk mass. This may compensate for the disadvantages of the later hatching chicks. These results have implications for adaptive hypotheses that were proposed for asynchronous incubation. 4. Eggs of lighter clutches contained more androgens, perhaps to compensate for a lower nutritional quality of these eggs. 5. Birds breeding in the periphery of a colony, being relatively more aggressive and having relatively large territories, laid eggs that contained more androgens than those of birds breeding in the centre. These high yolk androgen levels may facilitate growth and motor development of the chicks, which may be especially important for chicks developing at the periphery of a colony. Reduced levels may be adaptive for birds breeding in the centre, where risk of infectious diseases is high, since steroids may be immunosuppressive. 6. Corrected for nest distance, clutches of birds in high vegetation, where predation risk is less severe and therefore competition for nest sites perhaps high, contained relatively high levels of androgens. It is suggested that the level of yolk androgens reflects the hormonal condition of the female, that in turn is influenced by her characteristics such as her age and aggressiveness, and the level of social stimulation."

We manipulated systemic levels of hormones in reproductively mature female red-eared slider turtles (Trachemys scripta elegans) with silastic implants to test the hypothesis that hormones are allocated to developing follicles as a quantitative function of circulating levels in the females. Turtles exhibited similar amounts (<1 ng/ml) of circulating steroids (dihydrotestosterone, estradiol-17, or testosterone) in early September immediately prior to experimental manipulation. After treatment with silastic implants, circulating levels of steroids increased markedly. By the following April after hibernation, circulating levels of dihydrotestosterone had returned to preimplantation levels, but circulating levels of estradiol-17 and testosterone in estradiol-17- and testosterone-treated turtles, respectively, remained substantially elevated through April. Focusing on testosterone, we detected nearly six-fold higher concentrations in yolk from mature follicles from testosterone-treated turtles than in yolk from mature follicles from control turtles. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that concentrations of steroids in egg yolks of turtles reflect circulating concentrations of steroids during follicular development rather than the hypothesis that females selectively allocate specific amounts of steroid hormones to each egg separately.

Females were collected, and both follicles and shelled eggs (when present) were harvested for hormone analysis. Progesterone levels did not vary seasonally. However, the concentration of progesterone did vary among and within follicle classes, and was primarily dependent upon ovulatory state: Recently ovulated follicles (as yolks within shelled eggs) contained significantly more progesterone than unovulated follicles. Concentrations of testosterone were low and did not vary either among size classes or across the season. Estradiol levels decreased with increasing follicle size and were higher later in the nesting season.

Although several mechanisms have been put forward to explain how females might control the sex of their eggs, virtually nothing is known. As females are the heterogametic sex in birds, adjustment of the clutch sex ratio could arise either by pre- or post-ovulation control mechanisms. The Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis) exhibits extreme adaptive egg sex ratio bias. Typically, warblers produce only single-egg clutches, but by translocating pairs to vacant habitat of very high quality, most females were induced to produce two-egg clutches. Overall, females skewed clutch sex ratios strongly towards daughters (86.6%). This bias was evident in the first egg, but critically, also in the second eggs laid a day apart, even when all absent, unhatched, or unsexed second eggs were assumed to be male. Although a bias in the first egg may arise through either pre- or post-ovulation mechanisms, the skew observed in second eggs could only arise through pre-ovulation control. Post-ovulation adjustment may also contribute to skewed hatchling sex ratios, but as sex-biased release of gametes is likely to be a more efficient process of control, pre-ovulation mechanisms may be the sole means of adjustment in this species. High fitness differentials between sons and daughters, as apparent in the Seychelles warblers, may be necessary for primary sex ratio adjustment to evolve."

In previous studies of adhesion-competent mouse blastocysts, we have demonstrated that integrin-mediated fibronectin (FN)-binding activity on the apical surface of trophoblast cells is initially low, but becomes strengthened after embryos are exposed to FN. In the present study, we have examined whether the ligand-induced upregulation of trophoblast adhesion to FN is mediated by integrin signaling. The strengthening of adhesion to FN required integrin ligation, which rapidly elevated cytoplasmic-free Ca2+. Chelation of intracellular Ca2+using BAPTA-AM, or inhibition of the Ca2+-dependent proteins, protein kinase C or calmodulin, significantly attenuated the effect of FN on binding activity. Furthermore, direct elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+levels with ionomycin upregulated FN-binding activity, demonstrating that Ca2+signaling is required and sufficient for strong adhesion to FN. Ca2+signaling may induce protein trafficking, a known requirement for ligand-induced upregulation of FN-binding activity. Indeed, intracellular vesicles accumulated in adhesion-competent blastocysts, but were absent after exposure to either FN or ionomycin. These findings suggest that, during implantation, contact between peri-implantation blastocysts and FN elevates intracellular Ca2+, which strengthens trophoblast adhesion to ECM through protein redistribution.  2002 Elsevier Science (USA)."

The mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity can be elucidated using multidisciplinary approaches, in which the dynamic interactions among developmental, hormonal and environmental factors are considered.

We found no support for either hypothesis. Rather, we found that individual females of all sizes and throughout the breeding season alternated offspring sex of sequentially laid eggs. Because female anoles also alternate the ovary that produces successive eggs, we tested a third hypothesis: females produce eggs of only one sex with each ovary. Both palpation to track which ovary produced which eggs, and unilateral ovariectomies, leaving females with only one functioning ovary, failed to support this hypothesis. Regardless of whether an ovary was removed, females were capable of producing both male and female offspring from either ovary.

Clathrin-coated pits are visible near the furrow in ultrathin sections, while immunolabeling demonstrates that clathrin and caveolin are localized to the cleavage furrow. Hence, it is likely that both clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis occurs at the furrow during cytokinesis. Dynamin II is also localized to the furrow and may mediate furrow-specific endocytosis. Treatment of embryos with chlorpromazine or with methyl--cyclodextrin, both of which inhibit endocytosis, prevents the normal completion of cytokinesis.

We investigated nest-site selection and its consequences in the snapping turtle, Chelydra serpentina, in northwestern Illinois. We evaluated nest-site selection at both the microhabitat and habitat patch levels. Turtles selected nest sites with shorter vegetation, more open sand, and fewer cacti than random locations. These microhabitat characteristics described sandy patches where both nest density and success were higher compared to grassy patches in 1999. We subsequently investigated nest-site selection within two discrete subdivisions of the study area that varied in the degree of human disturbance to determine if nesting behavior, nest success, or nest temperatures were affected. The tendency to nest in sandy patches was much stronger at the natural site due to habitat modifications at the residential site that have blurred the distinction between sandy and grassy patches. Additionally, the residential site had a high density of nests within 5 m of houses and a fence (both areas with disturbed habitat similar to sandy patches), compared to the overall density. Thus, nest success associated with sandy patches may be compromised at the residential site; an ecological trap may result in lower nest success in areas with preferred microhabitat characteristics. Despite a similar basis for nest-site selection in terms of microhabitat characteristics at both sites, nest temperatures were correlated with microhabitat characteristics used to select nest sites only at the natural site. Nest temperatures at the residential site were instead correlated only with the percentage overstory vegetation cover and therefore averaged 2C lower than at the natural site, a temperature difference that influenced offspring sex. The higher percentage overstory vegetation cover at the residential site was due to human alterations of the habitat, and may serve to extend the ecological trap biasing the sex ratio of this population. This study illustrates the importance of (1) nest-site selection as a substantive maternal effect, (2) understanding habitat use during crucial life-history events, and (3) the potential for human disturbance to modify offspring phenotypes and negatively impact nest success despite adaptive nesting behavior."

It is expressed at high levels during early oogenesis, but no detectable vasa RNA and little Vasa protein are present in mature unlaid eggs. None appears to be localized to any defined region of the egg cortex, suggesting that germline specification may not depend on maternal germ plasm expressing vasa. Vasa protein is expressed in most cleavage energids as they reach the egg surface and persists at high levels in most cells aggregating to form the embryonic primordium. However, after gastrulation, Vasa protein persists only in extraembryonic membranes and in cells at the outer margin of the late heart-stage embryo. In the embryo, it then become restricted to cells at the dorsal margin of the forming abdomen. In older embryos, these Vasa-positive cells move toward the midline; Vasa protein accumulates asymmetrically in their cytoplasm, a pattern closely resembling that of germ cells in late embryonic gonads.

In addition, some effects of progesterone treatment differed between male and female fetuses, suggesting that this buffering may differ between the sexes. In a second experiment, we examined the relationship between maternal and fetal hormone levels in viviparous versus oviparous species.

The putative intracellular messenger, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), releases Ca2+ from stores that are distinct from SER. Evidence is presented here that NAADP causes a concentration-dependent increase in quantal output that is associated with an increase in probability of transmitter release at the frog neuromuscular junction. This effect is mimicked by A23187, a Ca ionophore that promotes Ca2+ entry at the plasmalemma. The response to NAADP is potentiated by IP3 but antagonized by cADPR. Thapsigargin completely blocks IP3 and cADPR responses and decreases but does not prevent the response to NAADP. We conclude that NAADP, whose receptors are widely distributed in the brain, enhances neurosecretion by releasing Ca2+ from an internal store near the plasmalemma, possibly from synaptic vesicles in the releasable pool. These data also support the hypothesis of a two-pool model for Ca2+ oscillations at the presynaptic site."

Given these widespread and significant effects, hormonal investments have the potential to greatly influence fitness of offspring. Intraspecific variation can exist at three levels (within individual eggs, among eggs within clutches, and among eggs from different females), each of which has different implications for offspring. We characterized all three levels of variation in maternally derived androgens (testosterone and androstenedione) present in yolks of American coot eggs. We found no variation in testosterone levels within eggs which suggests that embryos are exposed to constant androgen levels during development, and that field-based yolk biopsies are an appropriate way to sample eggs for this species. Within clutches, early-laid eggs had higher androgen levels than late-laid eggs, and this pattern may exacerbate negative effects of hatching asynchrony on chicks from late-hatching eggs if androgens provide chicks with a behavioral or growth advantage over chicks from eggs with lower androgen levels. American coots lay large clutches, and unequal resource allocation among offspring may be the optimal strategy for females with access to limited resources. Most of the variation in androgen levels occurred among eggs from different females. Females nesting on ponds with two other pairs laid eggs with significantly higher androgen levels than females living on ponds with fewer pairs. This suggests that increased territory defense behaviors influence the levels of androgens allocated to eggs and may be one mechanism underlying density-dependent effects on reproduction."

By analyzing the kinetics of sea urchin egg secretory vesicle exocytosis in vitro, the final steps of exocytosis are resolved. These steps are modeled as a three-state system: activated, committed, and fused, where interstate transitions are given by the probabilities that an active fusion complex commits () and that a committed fusion complex results in fusion, p. The number of committed complexes per vesicle docking site is Poisson distributed with mean n. Experimentally, p and n increase with increasing calcium, whereas  and the p/n ratio remain constant, reducing the kinetic description to only one calcium-dependent, controlling variable, n. On average, the calcium dependence of the maximum rate (Rmax) and the time to reach Rmax (Tpeak) are described by the calcium dependence of n. Thus, the nonlinear relationship between the free calcium concentration and the rate of exocytosis can be explained solely by the calcium dependence of the distribution of fusion complexes at vesicle docking sites."

In doing so, they may adaptively tune each offspring's competitive ability and, thus, growth and survival. However, evidence in support of this hypothesis is contradictory. The yolk concentrations of maternal androgens in the eggs of black-headed gulls increase significantly with the laying order of the eggs in a clutch. We experimentally tested the functional consequences of this increase on chick development under natural conditions by injecting eggs with either an oil or androgen solution. We created experimental clutches in which androgen levels either stayed constant or increased with laying order while controlling for differences in egg quality by using only first-laid eggs. We then compared development, growth and survival between these broods. Androgen treatment enhanced embryonic development because androgen-treated eggs hatched half a day earlier than controls, while their size at hatching was similar to oil-treated controls. Androgen treatment did not increase chick survival, but it enhanced growth. Androgen-treated, third-hatched chicks had a higher body mass and longer legs than third-hatched chicks that hatched from oil-treated eggs. At the same time, growth of first chicks (which were all oil treated) was reduced by the presence of two androgen-treated siblings, suggesting that yolk androgens enhance the competitive ability of later-hatched chicks. Our results support the hypothesis that transfer of different amounts of androgens to the eggs of a clutch is a mechanism by which mothers maximize their reproductive output."

However, elevated levels of testosterone are also associated with costs of increased peroxidative damage from free radicals and consequent oxidative stress. Diet-derived antioxidants, such as vitamin E and various carotenoids, provide protection against the deleterious effects of oxidative stress. Here we show that within-clutch variation in yolk testosterone is the opposite to that of yolk antioxidant concentration in the lesser black-backed gull Larus fuscus. We provide evidence that suggests that these two direct maternal effects are, in fact, complementary and, in conjunction with an indirect maternal effect (the onset of incubation), may provide an adaptive mechanism for parental favoritism in response to environmental variability. The potential implications of these findings with respect to previous investigations on variation in yolk testosterone concentrations and on the understanding of intrafamilial dynamics are discussed."

There was a similar pattern of hormonally heterogeneous yolk layers in both species: concentrations of progesterone and testosterone were significantly higher in the external yolk layer while concentrations of 17-estradiol were significantly higher in the intermediate and internal layers. This pattern of hormone deposition concurs with previously published studies of plasma hormone profiles from females of temperate-zone turtle species. Yolks of freshly laid eggs were also sampled using a biopsy technique to examine the concordance of early yolk hormone concentrations and offspring sex. No relationship was found between yolk hormone concentrations and individual offspring sex. Previous work showing that maternally derived yolk estradiol concentrations are correlated with female-biased sex ratios was, however, replicated.

We documented plasma and yolk T concentrations in adult females, in their developing follicles and eggs, and in freshly oviposited and incubating eggs. Plasma T was higher in reproductively active than in reproductively inactive females. Within reproductively active females, those with a single, large yolking follicle had higher plasma T than those that had one or more shelling, oviductal eggs. Individual females contributed different amounts of T to their yolks, but within females, more mature follicles or eggs consistently had higher yolk T concentrations than did less mature follicles or eggs. Similar to previous research, yolk T concentrations at oviposition were higher in male eggs than in female eggs. However, T levels during incubation did not differ by embryo sex, but rather increased in both male and female eggs. These results suggest that T plays a role in the reproductive physiology of females and potentially in the phenotypic development of their offspring. Furthermore, whereas the yolk T increase observed during follicular maturation is clearly a maternal influence, it remains unclear whether that observed during egg development (i.e., postfertilization) results from a lack of T uptake by the embryo as yolk is absorbed, from embryonic production of T that diffuses into the yolk, or from some combination of these processes. Because lizard embryos are comparatively well developed at oviposition, the assumption that yolk steroids are strictly of maternal origin may require modification, and the possibility that embryos are modulating their own steroid environment needs to be explored.  2001 Academic Press."

Over the course of a photoinduced breeding period in the laboratory, we measured concentrations of plasma immunoreactive prolactin (ir-prolactin) in female kestrels with ad libitum food availability (control) or food availability that was reduced during the early breeding period. In a second laboratory study, we administered via osmotic mini-pumps ovine prolactin (o-prolactin) to females beginning on the day they laid their first egg of a clutch (egg-day 1) to determine the effects of high prolactin concentrations on yolk-androgen concentrations. In both this study and one on free-living kestrels, we quantified changes in yolk-androgen concentrations with date of clutch initiation. Concentrations of ir-prolactin in nonlaying females rose with date, irrespective of food treatment. Egg-day 1 ir-prolactin concentrations were higher in control females laying late during the breeding phase than in those laying early. This increase was absent in food-reduced females. Yolk-androgen concentrations in eggs 3 and 4 but not eggs 1 and 2 of the clutch were higher in clutches initiated late than in clutches initiated early in the breeding phase in both the field and laboratory. o-Prolactin treatment elevated yolk-testosterone but not androstenedione concentrations.

Concentrations of maternally derived yolk androgens have previously been shown to be lower in first-laid than in later-laid eggs in the clutch.

The musculus complexus, or hatching muscle, is responsible for breaking the shell during hatching and for dorsal flexion and extension of the neck during begging. An increase in its strength in last-hatched nestlings could therefore reduce the duration of hatching or enhance the ability to beg for parentally-delivered food, thereby enhancing the competitive abilities of those nestlings. I previously found in the Red-winged Blackbird Agelaius phoeniceus that the mass of the complexus increases with laying order and that its development is mediated by the actions of yolk testosterone. I investigated the hypothesis that yolk steroids also affect the development of the complexus in the European Starling Sturnus vulgaris. I asked, first, whether the mass of the complexus increases with laying order and, if so, whether this increase is at least partially attributable to a corresponding increase in the concentration of yolk testosterone. Because exogenous progesterone increases the water content of the complexus in the domestic fowl Gallus gallus I also asked whether an increase in complexus mass, if present, could be partially attributable to an increase in progesterone concentration across the laying order. I found that both yolk testosterone concentration and the mass of the complexus increased with laying order; however, there was no variation in the concentration of either yolk progesterone or the proportion of water in the complexus across the laying order.

Plasma T for juvenile males was within the range detected in breeding adult females, but it was 20- to 45-fold lower than that of adult males, breeding or postbreeding. All eggs contained detectable yolk T, but eggs that gave rise to males contained nearly twice as much yolk T as those that gave rise to females.

Like cytoplasmic elements, cultural traits can be inherited through one sex. This, in turn, favors skewing the primary sex allocation in favor of the transmitting sex. Female nest-site philopatry is a sex-specific, culturally inherited trait in many reptiles with ESD and highly female-biased sex ratios.

A significant amount of cortisol was converted to cortisone and an unidentified molecule by the follicular layer. The contents of 3H-cortisol and 3H-cortisone in the oocyte reached an equilibrium level within 12 hr, whereas the content of the unidentified metabolite continued to increase for 36 hr.

The adverse actions of yolk androgen treatment in the kestrel are in contrast to the favourable actions of yolk T treatment found previously in canaries (Serinus canaria). Additional studies are necessary in order to determine whether the deposition of yolk androgens is an adaptive form of parental favouritism or an adverse by-product of endocrine processes during egg formation.

It encodes a putative RNA-binding molecule expressed maternally and localized predominantly to the vegetal half of the egg. Upon fertilization and cortical rotation, xBic-C mRNA is displaced together with the heavy yolk towards the future dorsal side of the embryo. In UV-ventralized embryos, xBic-C is polyadenylated less than in untreated embryos that undergo cortical rotation. Overexpression of xBic-C by injection of synthetic mRNA in whole embryos or in ectodermal explants leads to ectopic endoderm formation. This endoderm-inducing activity is dependent on the presence of the RNA-binding domain of the protein.

Identifying the specific role(s) of a given protein, beyond its general involvement in exocytosis, has therefore proven problematic. Furthermore, the power of time-resolved optical and electrophysiological assays can be best applied to testing the function of known proteins rather than to the identification of unknown, critical membrane components. The identification of essential membrane constituents requires combined biochemical (molecular) and functional (physiological) analyses. A fully functional, stage-specific physiological membrane preparation would be one direct approach to dissecting the calcium-triggered fusion steps of regulated exocytosis. Herein we review our use of specific minimal membrane preparations consisting of fully primed and docked secretory vesicles, or the isolated vesicles themselves, and characterize the late events of exocytosis, with an aim towards identification of essential molecular components. We have established a functional definition of the fusion complex and its activation by calcium, based on our kinetic analyses. Together with a variety of biochemical and alternate functional assays, we have tested whether the SNARE core complex that is present in our vesicle membranes satisfies the criteria of the functionally defined fusion complex. Rather than a direct fusogenic role, the SNARE complex may promote the calcium sensitivity of fusion, possibly by defining or delimiting a localized, focal membrane fusion site that ensures rapid and efficient exocytosis in vivo.

It includes processes as diverse as the release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic nerve endings and the sperm-triggered deposition of a barrier preventing polyspermy in oocytes. Cell-free model systems have been developed for studying the biochemical events underlying exocytosis. They range from semi-intact permeabilized cells to the reconstitution of membrane fusion from isolated secretory vesicles and their target plasma membranes. Interest in such cell-free systems has recently been reinvigorated by new evidence suggesting that membrane fusion is mediated by a basic mechanism common to all intracellular fusion events. In this chapter, we review some of the literature in the light of these new developments and attempt to provide a critical discussion of the strengths and limitations of the various cell-free systems."

Levels of the stress hormone, cortisol, in females are elevated by social interactions and transferred directly to the yolk of eggs, where they may influence developmental rates. In some vertebrates, prenatal exposure to high levels of testosterone determine early growth rates, social status and reproductive success. The present study examined whether post-fertilization exposure of eggs of the tropical damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis (Pomacentridae), to natural levels of cortisol or testosterone directly affects larval morphology at hatching. Maternal and egg levels of cortisol and testosterone varied widely among clutches of eggs from local populations around Lizard Island on the Great Barrier Reef. The morphology of larvae produced by these local fish populations also varied widely and differed significantly among sites (e.g., standard length: 2.6-3.4 mm; yolk sac area: 0.010.13 x 10-2 mm2). Laboratory experiments showed that elevated cortisol levels in the egg reduced larval length at hatching, while slight elevations in testosterone increased yolk sac size. The influence of testosterone, and to a smaller extent cortisol, on larval morphology differed among egg clutches. These differences were partly explained by differences in initial egg hormone levels. Morphological changes induced by experimental hormonal regimes encompassed the entire range of variability in body attributes found in field populations. It is unclear whether cortisol influences growth alone or development rate or both. Testosterone appears to influence yolk utilization rates, and has no significant effect on growth, in contrast to its role in later developmental stages. Maternally derived cortisol and testosterone are important in regulating growth, development, and nutritive reserves of the embryo and larvae of this fish species. Factors that influence the maternal levels of cortisol and testosterone may have a major impact on larval mortality schedules and, therefore, on which breeding individuals contribute to the next generation."

Blood samples were collected from free-living parental males during that part of the breeding season when males may be found in various stages of parental care. Plasma 11- ketotestosterone levels were significantly higher in males with empty nests and nests containing only eggs than in males with nests containing embryos. All males with nests containing embryos had undetectable testosterone levels, whereas testosterone levels were detectable in many males with empty nests or nests containing only eggs. Estradiol levels were detectable in only a few males from nests with no eggs or nests containing only eggs. Cortisol levels were not correlated with stage of paternal care or with handling time. These results follow the frequently reported vertebrate pattern of declining androgen levels over the course of the breeding season or during the period of parental care. However, many male midshipman guarding nests containing only eggs had androgen levels similar to those of males whose nests contained no offspring. Thus the pattern of androgen levels exhibited by reproductively active parental male midshipman may reflect a compromise between investment in paternal care versus courtship and/or territoriality."

Homologues of vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), syntaxin, and SNAP-25 were identified in CV membranes. A VAMP and syntaxin immunoreactive band at a higher apparent molecular mass (70 kDa) was detected; extraction and analysis confirmed that the band contained VAMP, SNAP-25, and syntaxin. This complex was also identified by immunoprecipitation and by sucrose gradient analysis. VAMP in the complex was insensitive to proteolysis by tetanus toxin. All criteria identify the SNARE complex as that described in other secretory systems. Complexes exist pre- formed on individual CV membranes and form between contacting CV. Most notably, CV SNARE complexes are disrupted in response to [Ca2+](free) that trigger maximal fusion. N-Ethylmaleimide, which blocks fusion at or before the Ca2+-triggering step, blocks complex disruption by Ca2+. However, disruption is not blocked by lysophosphatidylcholine, which transiently arrests a late stage of fusion. Since removal of lysophosphatidylcholine from Ca2+-treated CV is known to allow fusion, complex disruption occurs independently from the membrane fusion step. As Ca2+ disrupts rather than stabilizes the complex, the presumably coiled-coil SNARE interactions are not needed at the time of fusion. These findings rule out models of fusion in which SNARE complex formation goes to completion ('zippers-up') after Ca2+ binding removes a 'fusion-clamp'."

We have tested this hypothesis by isolating reserve granules from sea urchin eggs and determining under which conditions these granules will fuse. We find that isolated reserve granules, lacking soluble cofactors, support calcium-dependent membrane fusion in vitro. Preincubation with adenosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate and guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate did not prevent fusion. Thus, isolated reserve granules have all the necessary components required for calcium-gated fusion prior to docking."

Reproduction starts at the age of one year. Males grow to a larger size than females and, during the breeding season, they develop fat deposits in the pectoral fin and an elongated recurved pectoral spine that often assumes a reddish colour. Analysis of gonadal development and surveys of nesting in swamps show that initiation of reproduction is associated with the onset of the rainy season. Males start building the nest at night, and spawning takes place around noon the day after. Most nests are built in newly flooded swamps, especially in open water in the peripheral area of the swamp. A minimum distance of 10 m between nests is usually observed. The floating bubble nest consists of a dome of plant material supported by oxygen-rich foam produced by the male. Diameter and height of the nest average 30 and 6 cm, respectively. The nest is the centre of a territory that is vigorously defended by the male, using its enlarged pectoral spine, against conspecific and heterospecific intruders. The number of nests that did not acquire spawns (48 %) suggests a strong competition among males for females. There are indications that the female drinks the sperm and that fertilization takes place after the sperm has passed through her digestive tract. Hoplosternum littorale is a multiple spawner. Investment in reproduction is high in females since they can spawn up to 14 times during a 7-month breeding season and each spawn consists of 6 000 to 9 000 eggs. On average, two to four females spawn simultaneously, resulting in an average number of 20 000 eggs per nest. Incubation of the eggs takes two to three days depending on the temperature in the nest. Despite intense predation pressure on eggs and larvae, the guarding behaviour of the male extends for only one or two days after hatching. In the hypoxic water of tropical swamps, the main function of the floating bubble nest appears to be to provide oxygen to the developing eggs by lifting the eggs above the water surface while protecting them from desiccation. Other functions of the nest may be protection of the brood against predators, temperature regulation, identification of the centre of the territory and synchronization of reproductive activities. We suggest that H. littorale may be a useful model for the study of the reproduction of tropical freshwater fish in hypoxic environments."

To determine whether or not their Y chromosome can be transmitted through the female line, an androhermaphrodite was crossed with an X-ray-induced hermaphrodite harbouring a large deletion on the Y chromosome, which makes it unable to pass through male or female meiosis. When this mutant hermaphrodite was pollinated with the androhermaphrodite, the seed progeny consisted of male, androhermaphrodite and female plants, whereas the reciprocal cross yielded female plants only. The genotypes of both parents and progeny were verified by karyological and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses. The results show that the Y chromosome cannot pass through the female line, probably because of the absence of an X chromosome during embryo sac formation or an imbalance of X/Y chromosomes in developing endosperm."

Spermatozoa are biflagellated in the Channel catfish (lctalurus punctatus) and monoflagcllatcd in the European catfish (Silurus glanis) and African catfishes (Clarias gariepinus, Heterobranchus longifilis). The egg size shows considerable intergroup differences, from 0.8-1.2 mm in some Pimelodidae and Clariidae up to 15-20 mm in Ariidac. In numerous cases, the eggs are adhesive and develop either a surrounding sticky layer (lctalurus, Chrysichthys, Silurus) or an adhesive attachment disc (Clarias, Heterobranchus). Fertilization is in general external but internal fertilization is reported in some species. The annual sperm production was measured in European catfish and Channel catfish as 1.7  10n and 1.8  1010 spermatozoa.kg 1 body weight, respectively. In females, the fecundity ranges from about 50 eggs per spawn in ariids up to more than 100000 eggs.kg 1 body weight, e.g. in pimelodids and clariids. A large variety of controlled reproduction systems are found in the siluroids. In some cases (lctalurus, Chrysichthys, Hoplosternum), spawning occurs naturally in ponds or tanks provided that adequate spawning substrates are available; fertilized eggs are collected immediately after spawning and placed into incubators until hatching. But for most species, although natural or semi- natural spawning could be achieved in captivity, the tendency at the present time is to develop techniques using hormonal-induced ovulation and artificial insemination in order to control the various steps of reproduction and to allow gamete preservation and manipulation. Oocyte maturation and ovulation or spermiation can be induced in many species by a large variety of hormones (GnRHs, fish gonadotropins, hCG, various steroids etc). Some information is available on gamete biology and preservation. Sperm motility is short-lived, not exceeding 70-80 s of forward movement as in most other freshwater teleosts. A peculiarity of the European catfish sperm is the activation by urine during sampling which could be prevented by direct collection in an immobilizing solution (NaCl 200 mM, Tris HC1 30 mM, pH 7.0). Spermatozoa cryoprcscrvation was successfully attempted in several species. Ova generally survive only a few hours after ovulation and fertilization must be carried out soon after.

However, the developmental challenges faced by eggs, zygotes, and early embryos appear to require specializations of cytoskeletal function, as described in this chapter. The cytoskeletal specializations outlined in this article, are not meant to be an exclusive list but rather a starting point for the recognition of these special roles. Indeed, future studies are likely to lengthen the list of specialized cytoskeletal functions in early development. Conversely, it is also useful to remember that somatic cells originate from the development of an embryo, and there is no reason to assume that somatic cells lose all of the specialized functions present in their progenitor cells (i.e., the zygote and blastomeres of the embryo). But in somatic cells some or all of these specialized roles may be greatly reduced in scope, making them difficult to detect. Thus characterization of the specialized functions of the cytoskeleton during early development may aid the identification of more subtle cytoskeletal functions in somatic cells.  1995, Elsevier Inc."

During each somatic cell cycle, the chromosomes, cytoplasm, and centrosomes duplicate in interphase, and all three split in two during each cell division. While it has long been recognized that both the sperm and the egg contribute equal haploid genomes during fertilization and that the vast majority of the cytoplasm is contributed by the egg, the relative contributions of the centrosome by each gamete are still in question. This article explores centrosome inheritance patterns and considers nine integral and secondarily derived activities of the centrosome. Boveri once hvpothesized that 'The ripe egg possesses all of the elements necessary for development save an active division-center. The sperm, on the other hand, possesses such a center but lacks the protoplasmic substratum in which to operate. In this respect the egg and sperm are complementary structures; their union in syngamy thus restores to each the missing element necessary to further development.' This article reviews the evidence gathered from 11 experimental strategies used to test this theory. While the majority of these approaches supports the hypothesis that the sperm introduces the centrosome at fertilization, the pattern did not reveal itself as universal, since parthenogenesis occurs in nature and can be induced artificially, since centrosome and centriole form de novo in extracts from unfertilized eggs and since the centrosome is derived from maternal sources during fertilization in some systems - notably, in mice. Models of the centrosome are proposed, along with speculative mechanisms which might lead to the cloaking of the reproducing element of the maternal centrosome during oogenesis and the retention of this structure by the paternal centrosome during spermatogenesis. Proteins essential for microtubule nucleation, like -tubulin, are retained in the cytoplasm during oogenesis, but are largely lost during spermatogenesis. It is further postulated that the restoration of the zygotic centrosome at fertilization requires the attraction of maternal centrosomal components (in particular, -tubulin and the 25S '-some' particle) to the paternal reproducing element; this, along with post-translational modifications (including phosphorylation, disulfide reduction, and calcium ion binding), creates a functional zygote centrosome by blending both maternal and paternal constituents. Eggs capable of effecting parthenogenetic development, it is proposed, have a renaturable seed for centrosome reproduction and are therefore able to circumvent the requirement for paternal contribution. A model of centrosome behavior during gametogenesis and fertilization is presented: the sperm introduces the centrosome-reproducing element and a structure that attracts maternal proteins, including -tubulin and the other proteins comprising the '-some.' This concentration of -tubulin initially nucleates the microtubules for the sperm aster and also attracts additional -tubulin, resulting in the enlargement of the sperm aster. When the female pronucleus is contacted by the sperm astral microtubules, it moves toward the center of the sperm aster using dynein-like motors. The interaction between centrin in the sperm centrosome and the calcium released in the egg during activation is suggested to result in the excision of the sperm tail from the centrosome and sperm head, and also perhaps in the transformation of the basal body into the mature centrosome. Furthermore, the axonemal microtubules disassemble following sperm incorporation, and their disassembly requires microtubule dynamics. Fertilization is concluded when the parental genomes intermix; in humans, this occurs when chromosomes merge at the equator of the first mitotic spindle, which is anastral and often eccentric. The zygotic centrosome duplicates and splits immediately prior to the completion of the fertilization process. In essence, this model suggests that the zygote's centrosome is a blend of oocyte centrosomal proteins (including -tubulin) attracted to the sperm's centrosome, which is capable of both binding -tubulin and reproducing each cell cycle.  1994 Academic Press, Inc."

At cycle 1, there was no difference in nuclear position among the strains that we observed. At cycle 2 the two sister nuclei had already migrated posteriorly in the wild type. However, migration was not detectable at cycle 2 in the mutants. Besides, the two sister nuclei were lessseparated from each other, and orientation of the two nuclei with regard to the anteroposterior axis was random, different from the wild type.

T4 and T3 content in larval yolk stayed constant as yolksac size decreased, resulting in increased thyroid hormone concentration in the yolksac. All of these data suggest that the initial source of thyroid hormones in coho and chinook salmon eggs is maternal, but that by approximately 3-4 weeks after fertilization, the developing embryos begin to produce their own thyroid hormones. After hatching, increases in tissue T4 and T3 concentration coupled with constant T4 and T3 content in diminishing yolksacs suggest that larvae also produce their own thyroid hormones; yolksac content then may reflect both the original maternal hormones and the larva-producted hormones.  1989 Kugler Publication."

The role played by the cell nucleus as a whole in morphogenesis is a very old problem; the most direct approach to its solution is merotomy, that is, cutting an egg or a unicellular organism into two halves: nucleate and anucleate. The anucleate fragments of Acetabularia retain a photosynthetic circadian rhythm for several weeks. However, it is the nucleus that sets the clock, as has been shown by experiments in which nucleate and anucleate halves of algae, which were at opposite phases of the cycle, were combined. Unfertilized sea urchin eggs can be cut into two halves (nucleate and anucleate) by high-speed centrifugation in a density gradient. Both nucleate and anucleate fragments can be fertilized or treated with parthenogenetic agents. Oogenesis is the preparation for embryonic development: there is a progressive accumulation of reserve materials (glycogen, lipids, and proteins), of ribosomes, and of about 20,000 different maternal mRNAs. Maturation transforms the fully grown oocyte (1.11.2 mm in diameter for Xenopus) into an egg that, after fertilization, can give rise to an embryo and finally an adult of the same species. The egg is thus a giant totipotent cell. Xenopus eggs are fertilizable when the first polar body has been expelled; they can also be activated by pricking, electrical shock, or treatment with the divalent ions ionophore A23187. As in sea urchin eggs, the main early biochemical changes in activated or fertilized Xenopus eggs are increases in free Ca2+ and pHi.  1987, Academic Press, Inc."

In the course of gray crescent formation, the egg reorganizes its periphery by a movement for which two descriptions have been given. According to the ""rotation hypothesis,"" which was originated and supported for Rana eggs, the entire egg cortex rotates by an arc of 30 relative to the stationary subcortical cytoplasm, leaving the crescent as a zone of altered coloration. The ""contraction hypothesis"" on the other hand, which was proposed for Xenopus and Rana eggs, asserts that there is a cortical contraction focused at the sperm entry point that leads to stretching of the opposite equatorial zone at which the crescent appears. We have reinvestigated the case of Xenopus eggs by imprinting one kind of fluorescent dye pattern (Nile blue) onto the subcortical cytoplasm and another kind (fluorescein-lectin) onto the egg surface. When the egg surface is held fixed by embedding the egg in gelatin, two major movements of the subcortical cytoplasm are observable. First, starting at time 0.3 (30% of the time between fertilization and first cleavage), the animal hemisphere subcortical cytoplasm converges toward a point, while the vegetal hemisphere is quiescent. This convergence continues with decreasing strength until approximately 0.8 of the first cell cycle. Second, at 0.45, an overall rotation of the animal and vegetal subcortical cytoplasm commences, superimposed on the animal hemisphere convergence. By 0.8-0.9 the rotation is complete, having accomplished a 30 displacement of the subcortical cytoplasm relative to the surface. This rotation reliably locates the future dorsal midline of the embryo at the meridian on which the displacement of the subcortical cytoplasm is greatest in a vegetal direction. In normal unembedded eggs, when the egg surface is free to move, it rotates 30 relative to the subcortical cytoplasm, which remains stationary in a position of gravitational equilibrium. Although both a convergence and rotation occur in the Xenopus egg, we give evidence that the rotation, not the convergence (perhaps equated with contraction), specifies the embryo's prospective axis. Even though the Xenopus egg does not form a classical gray crescent, due to its particular pigment distribution, the reorganization process which specifies the future embryonic axis resembles that of the Rana egg.  1986."

Prior incubation of FL-phalloidin with F-actin from both rabbit and locust muscle blocked the staining action, whereas G-actin at the same concentration had no effect. At the initiation of cellularization bands of F-actin filaments, shaped into rough hexagons, were found around each forming cell close to the surface bulges. These bands interlinked across the whole embryo. Above the level of the hexagons was a fine meshwork of F-actin associated with many folds of the plasmalemma. Below the hexagons was a layer of small irregular actin aggregates. During the process of cellularization the hexagonal actin network was associated with the tips of the extending plasmalemmas until the cells reached their full length. It is suggested that this actin network acts as a contractile ring system which cleaves the embryo into cells. The network was then found to rapidly break down. Microfilament bundles formed rings associated with the bases of the cells. These are presumed to cleave off the fully formed cells from the underlying yolk sac. During the first phase of cell membrane growth the fine F-actin meshwork remained associated with the apical plasmalemmas. However, the mesh rapidly disappeared during the second period of extension. After this, actin aggregates were visible close to the apical surfaces of the cells. F-actin was also observed to be associated with the newly formed plasmalemmas along their length during the whole of the process of cleavage.  1983."

Their distribution correlates well with the distribution of microfilaments in structures such as the contractile ring, and these proteins are believed to have a major role in cell cleavage and plasmalemma elongation5. They have not previously been recorded in Drosophila eggs and embryos. The egg of Drosophila develops as a syncytium with about 6,000 nuclei present in a common cytoplasm6. Subsequently, nearly all the nuclei are simultaneously surrounded by plasmalemmas which grow down into the cortex of the egg. Because of this, and because of the existence of several mutants which specifically affect cellularisation7,8, Drosophila eggs are a particularly appropriate system in which to study cell membrane formation. The simultaneous cellularisation of the whole of the egg cortex would seem to require the existence of large numbers of microfilaments but these have not yet been visualised in the electron microscope9. We report here the finding of a continuous band of myosin immediately below the egg plasmalemma which could well be associated with massed microfilament bundles. This is laid down by the time of fertilisation and remains continuous until the arrival of the nuclei in the cortex. The structure of the band and its relationship to early developmental events are described.  1979 Nature Publishing Group."

Axolotl eggs which displayed easily recognizable gray crescents were employed for the direct irradiation experiments and albino axolotl eggs were used for a comparison of the U.V. sensitivity of the animal and vegetal halves of the egg. Marked frog eggs were employed to determine the relationship between the sensitive area and the site of formation of the dorsal lip.
