In 2004 there were eggs 5th and 6ththat were also manipulated and included in the nest; but since they had high mortality the authors did not include them in any of the coming analysis. For some nests they took the two first eggs and injected one with androgens and the other one with control. For other nests; they took the last two eggs and injected one with androgens and other with control. But then; when they put back the eggs into the nests; they divided 'early' nests from 'late' nests. Meaning that in early nests the 4 eggs of the clutch were 2 treated (one its own egg the other one from another female) and 2 control. So 50% of the eggs were treated per nest. I'm not sure about the number of predictors; but because it is not clear if the predictors they state in the statistical section were the same for all response variables. ,NA,PBD,LM; ASF,1) The authors reported that the clutch size is usually 4 eggs; and they also fit all nests to have that clutch size. This is why even though the mean clutch size is not reported we wrote 4. 2) we added the total number of eggs that were manipulated. 3) The chi-square has 1 factor (we assume that the description of the statistical test is for the other models).,NA,NA,NA,no,no,no,Chi-square

So there's no way to change the variable name (so it can follow within some of the categories we already established).

It says hatching failure; so I wonder whether this is more of a comparison of proportions of hatching failure between control and treatment nests. I played around in R and they seem to have run something like: chisq.test(as.matrix(cbind(c(13;9);c(6;14)));simulate.p.value = TRUE); and thus; this is also at the nest level and therefore a mother's trait? (2) Var should be set to NA since it says that it is an absolute percentage (although is it really a percentage; 13 are 6 are simply the nests that survived out of the 22 and the 20. (3) Wouldn't it be better to extract the chi-square for the nonpredated nests; since that value would be more representative of what we want to measure here OR did you choose the other because the number of nonpredated nests is not clear? (4) I do not think we can conclude that the number of nests for the tests based on nests producing fledgelings is 19 (13+6) because it could be lower if some of those nests that survived did not produce fledglings but only eggs; isn't it? Unless you think that those 13 and 6 are defined implicitly as nests producing fledglings rather than simply nests producing some hatchlings. I could not say from my reading. ",(1) True. I divided this info into 2 rows - one infow ith hatching failure (this line); and the other one with the number of offspring that hatch (next line). Important: the chi-square presented here is from non-predated nests. (2) I modified this. (3) yes; modified. (4) Yes; I understood that the final clutches produced fledlgings. But I will contact the authors to check if the number of clutches that we reported are correct. ,No response by the authors,NA,no,no,no,Chi-square

But they used a kit that cross-reacts with DHT (5 beta and 5alpha) and androstenedione. This is why they talk about ""androgens"" in general.// In figure S4 there are 16 clutches and 76 eggs.
